"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red",Bought this for my daughter who is expecting her first baby. She said her friends said it is the one item that she absolutely must have! Easy to put on. Now just waiting for the baby!,5
Child to Cherish Handprints Tower Of Time Kit in Pink,"A perfect baby or first birthday gift. I received two myself as gifts.  I just finished one for my 5 year-old.  The last handprint. :(Perfect packaging, fast shipping.",5
CM Star Candy Heart Crossbody Shoulder Bag Satchel Purse Handbag Clutch,"It is very cute, and I got a lot of compliments.Pros-Really cuteCan hold my galaxy phone + walletHas a separate outside zipper for keys etcCons-It is a little heavy/clinky with the metal chain strap, but the strap also makes it look really coolIt swings around when I move so it's not very portableThere is a small decorative chain hanging from the bottom that is kind of long and is slightly noisy when it bangs on your legs when walkingIt's made well and is super cute though, and I would recommend it.",4
"JJ Cole Collections System Diaper Bag, Black Damask","I have had 3 of these bags - i love it so much.  I have had one with each of my children.  It holds everything.  It hangs great on the back of the stroller.  It's stylish and just great.  But the zipper has broke on each of my bags.  One of the bags actually tore along the seam. I would recommend the bag, because the poor quality hasn't made the bag impossible to use.  I do love it.  If I have another baby, I admit, I might get another one of these bags!",3
Recaro Signo Convertible Car Seat Midnight Desert,I have used this with both my kids. It is the best car seat on the market and lasts through different stages!,5
Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor,This is the best monitor- better than the regular monitors and than the angelcare monitor. You can see and hear your baby. The bad rewiews I read are from people who don't use commom sense. To set up your camera - have the monitor in the room with you so you can see what the camera is seeing- then take it to where you want to view your baby. You don't have to go back and forth 100 times. The reception is clear-- if it isn't -- change the channel. If there is feedback from the speaker- the volume is too high. The many problems people have are easily solved if you use your brain. I can't believe this monitor isn't reviewed at 5 stars across the board. I give it my 2 thumbs up and take comfort that I can see my baby is sleeping safe.,5
"3 Sprouts Storage Caddy, Mouse","This is my second caddy...I also have the walrus...liked it so much, I bought a second one...the walrus I use as a diaper caddy...I cloth diaper and it holds 3 diapers, wipes, hand sanitizer, diaper cream, as well as misc baby items (nail clippers, colic drops, etc) all in the main part...I am able to slip TV and heater remote in outside pockets, but if main caddy is full, the outer pockets feel tight...In the beaver caddy, I have floor and tummy time toys, a few Dr. Seuss books, teethers, rings, etc. When you first use it, it takes a bit for the bottom to lay flat, but once it does it will stand on its own.",4
Nuby 2 Pack Replacement Silicone Spouts,"I wish there was more photos/info about which models these fit. I searched the cups they were intended for and could find no model number on them (and of course I didn't keep the packaging - who does?), so assumed they were correct. Wrong! I'm out 2 bucks - they don't fit any I own.",3
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","I like the contours, keeps baby safer on the table.  Waterproof is true, needs a cover though because the plastic is crinkly and cold.",5
"Stork Craft Tuscany 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, White","We needed a crib for our grandson's visit and I liked the fact that many now grow with the child, turning into a toddler bed, daybed or full-size bed's headboard/footboard. I picked this particular crib because of the great product reviews and it seemed (and is) very sturdy. It arrived quickly and the packaging was excellent. It had been a while since we've had to assemble furniture so it took us a little while to put together. It was not too difficult, but definitely a two-person job. When my daughter saw it, she loved it - even more than the one she has!",5
"JOTO Premium Screen Protector Film Anti Glare, Anti Fingerprint (Matte Finish) for All New Kindle Fire HD 7 inch Tablet (will only fit All New Kindle Fire HD 7&quot; 2013 released), with Lifetime Replacement Warranty (3 Pack)",These screen protectors were easy to apply and no issue with getting the few air bubbles out.  Would buy again.,5
"Mountain Buggy Urban Jungle Stroller, Black Dot","I bought the Urban Jungle after extensive research... and love it!We were looking for a tough but stylish stroller that was suitable for the city, running, hiking trails and light enough to get in and out of a NYC cab.Great stroller! And the bassinet is perfect for a newborn.",5
Munchkin Bobble Bee Suction Toy,Very cute and keeps your baby entertained during meals.  The only reason why I am giving this a 4 is because the toy removes from the suction cup base very easily.  My daughter is 6 1/2 months old and can remove it quite easily.  I'd prefer it to stay stationary while I am feeding her and not have to worry about having to reattach it to the base multiple times during each meal.,4
Kidsline Zanzibar Musical Mobile,"Our baby loves this thing but it drives me CRAZY!!!  First of all, it should be battery operated because the wind-up motor doesn't last nearly long enough.  The other annoying thing is the stupid giraffe (which isn't even my baby's favorite animal, she likes the zebra) always getting caught on the post which supports the mobile.  This stops the mobile from turning and slows the music, they should have angled the post a little more over the crib so it doesn't get stuck like that.  Even with these two unfortunate problems, my baby LOVES this thing when it is working, it totally captivates her.  She is only a month old though, so maybe she will soon be annoyed like me.",3
Eco Sprout Detergent 48 oz. - Lavender / Chamomile,"I have tried several other varieties of detergent, and this is by far my favorite!  No &#34;off-smelling&#34; diapers any more!  It rinses clean and we haven't had to strip at all since switching.",5
"JJ Cole Lite Embroidered Bundleme, Pink, Infant",This product is very pretty but does not fit the Graco Safe Seat as it is too narrow and short for it.,1
"Medela Disc Collar, Slow Flow Nipple, and Clear Bottle Cap Replacement parts","this nipple is very good, the only thing that it made me give four is that it doesnt help with spit up but other than that its excellent",4
NuAngel Washable Nursing Pads 100% Cotton - Natural - 8 pads - Made in U.S.A.,"First time using these instead of disposable pads, and wish I would've discovered them sooner. They are softer and if you don't leak, they don't need to be changed as often. They don't stick, but also don't move around much-fine if you have a bra on, but don't stay in place as well with loose pajamas. Already bought a set for a gift.",5
Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Organic Cotton Wipes,"I love these organic wipes! You can't beat the price, about a dollar a piece. I ordered some of the double sided wipes from Charlie Banana, and even though they are thicker, they are made of one side organic cotton, one side 100% polyester :S... These are just one piece of organic cotton with a hem.. A little thinner, but so soft and will get the job done.  Definitely recommend!",5
The Piggyback Rider Standing Child Carrier - NILOC Model,"Preparing to take my daughter who is 4 to the Olympics, I needed to find a way to carry her that would result in no neck pain for me and no need to visit a Chiropractor. As a single Mom I needed to find something that I could use by myself, and easily worked out a way that I could strap in my daughter as well as put her safely on in the rider.Pros:Awesome view for my daughterEase of Access : A stroller in this situation would be a nightmare with many restrictions for accessEasy Stored in a Back Pack (tho the bag you ship makes NO Sense to me)Cons:My daughter got tired standing up, and after about 4hrs we resulted to my shouldersHard to distribute weight to my hips and found that standing bar bumped against my buttAlot of attention - everybody wanted to know where to get one!",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,This is well made and the bright colors attract my daughter's attention. If it was a little less expensive I would have given it 5 stars.,4
"Woombie Convertible Baby Swaddler (Big Baby 14-19 lbs, Little Monster)",The quality of this item is pretty good. Fabric feels light and stretchy. I like the zipper up top and on bottom (diaper changes should be easier this way) Unfortunately there's no way I could zip up all the way to my 9-pound baby's neck.(the item was the newborn > 13 pound size) The neck opening is just way too tight. Thank heavens for Amazon's great return policy.,2
Jeep 2-in-1 Baby Carrier,"My 1 month old son loves to be held and this carrier lets me meet his needs for closeness while still having hands free for the other kids or housework.  I am a mother of 4 and have tried every carrier on the market except the very expensive baby bjorn.  They were all complicated to use and weren't comfortable.I went to Babies-R-Us finally prepared to spend $100.00 on a baby bjorn.  While hesitating for one moment, I tried on this carrier and loved it even more than the baby bjorn.  It is VERY EASY TO USE.  We have only used it in the forward facing position so far.  One buckle on each side secures the carrier to the parent.  Then one slide lock buckle on each side secures the baby.  There is also a buckle on each side near the top to ensure lots of comfy head support for newborns.  It is very user friendly.  I also love that it does not have a waist strap.My husband is 6'2"" amd weighs about 240 pounds.  This carrier has straps plenty long enough to fit him and people much larger (or smaller).I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TRY THIS CARRIER!!!",5
The First Years Take and Toss 28-Piece Feeding Variety Pack,"I got this for a friend who doesn't know if they are having a boy or girl along with a really cute bib. I personally own these and think they are great! We use them on an every day basis, but if you lose a piece you aren't upset because they are so inexpensive.",5
"Pearhead Babyprints Desk Frame, Mahogany","This product was great.  The footprint kit was so easy, and it just has to dry for a good day, and then its ready to frame.  definatly reccomend this product.",5
Levana ClearVu Digital Video Baby Monitor with Color Changing Night Light (LV-TW301),"Not a clear night vision picture, bad audio quality. If i had an option I'd buy the Levana discont. product, babyview, way better.",2
"Skip Hop Hug and Hide Activity Toy, Owl","Love this owl so much, I have purchased it three times in the past year. Both Moms and babies loved receiving this!",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I purchased this pumping bra after extensively reading others' reviews. I've used it for about a month and I love it. I work at a really busy office, and couldn't really afford to lose 15 minutes a few times a day to sit and pump. This truly lets me be hands free and I can work on the computer or do paperwork while pumping. It does take a little getting used to. The first time I used it, I think it took 10 minutes to get myself situated. I've got it down to about a minute now. It's very customizable, which is part of the learning curve up front, but means nearly everyone should be able to use it. I'm 36D/size 10-12 in most things and purchased the XS/S/M; it fits fine with a little room for expanding outward if I needed to and a LOT of room for making it smaller.",4
Oopsy Daisy Fine Art for Kids NL190401MG Train Engine Night Light,I bought this for my son's room since he likes trains. I expected better quality for the amount it cost. All it is a picture sitting on top of a nightlight. It wiggles and has fallen off a couple of times. It's cute but it is not worth the money they charge for it.,3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",this was the perfect gift for my nephew to brighten up his room at night.  It is very cute and useful too,5
Nuby 2-Pack 8 oz No Spill Cup with Super Spout (Color may vary),"This was the 2nd sippy cup I bought. It leaks, the plastic spout part comes apart from the cup. Worst design.",2
"Dutailier Ultramotion Bow Back Glider Rocker and Ottoman Combo, Sage","I just got this put together.  The first thing I noticed and aspect I can't get rid of is the smell.  The varnish or stain used on the wood is overwhelming.  I hope it is not dangerous or harmful.  There are no instructions for assembly and left over parts.  There is nothing in the packaging or on the product that states ""Dutailier.""  The only thing that says Dutailier is the box, which makes me wonder if this is a knock off.  I will be calling Dutailier Monday to verify.  It is gliding quietly but the ottoman feels like it is going to fall apart.  I have to run, the smell is making me dizzy.",2
American Red Cross Door Finger Guard - 2 Pack,Product arrived prompt and in great condition. My little one and a half year old thinks she is much older and likes to run around in the bedrooms and close the doors behind her. I like to keep her room open so having these finger gaurds are great because not only do they prevent her from hurting herself but they keep the door from getting closed. Win win situation. Thanks,4
Mother-Ease Sandy's Cloth Diaper - Bamboo - Small (8-20 lbs),"Just thinking about a little 20# baby in this thing makes me laugh... But the size works for my baby beast, who was already 36"" and 32# at 18 months... All the other cloth diapers and wraps were fitting him like teeny bikini briefs. The high rise and extra room for stuffing with hemp inserts make it perfect for nighttime protection, when paired with Engel or Disana wool (which are probably the only covers that are big enough to cover this whole diaper, anyway).Just the high rise alone makes me happy... Having a tall baby can be difficult sometimes, because it seems like almost all baby stuff is designed for short lard balls.",5
Milkscreen: Home Test to Detect Alcohol in Breast Milk 8 Test Strips,These strips are great! I can have a glass of wine with dinner and be reassured that my baby's not having one too. Takes all the guessing out! Best invention ever... if you're nursing and like to have a drink now & then.,5
Teething Necklace Jewelry - Organic BPA Free Silicone Chew Beads Teether Toys for Nursing Moms - Tiffany - White,"This is a very cute necklace that is also a teething necklace.  It is so nice looking.  No one would guess it was a teething necklace. If you have a little one, you might want to check this out.",5
Motorola Digital Audio Baby Travel Monitor,I've used this twice and both times it's worked great.  Even when the child unit is across the room from her I can hear if she wakes up.  It's almost too good. When set on high at both ends my family could hear everything we were saying in the bedroom.  Remember to unplug it when not in use ;-),5
"Munchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket, Colors May Vary","Other than holding the pieces to the Dr. Brown bottles, nothing came out clean and this really wasn't worth the money.I use the Avent microwave sanitizer and continue to use the hot dishwasher cycle first. Disappointing.",1
Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib,These bibs seem like they will last a very long time. Get the job done and just throw them in the washer machine when dirty :) I bought some for both grandparents! Highly recommend.,5
Graco Secure Coverage Digital Baby Monitor with 2 Parent Units,I was able to hear noises being made a room away from where the base was located-- which was a good thing and speaks to the quality of the system.,5
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","My granddaughter, two and a half months, holds on to this little caterpillar and don't loose her paci'. Beautiful. So glad I bought it. Might buy more in different designs. One of these little gifts a new Moms at times can't justify buying, a great gift for grandparents if baby uses this kind of pacifier. Very well made. Recommend!",5
Stokke Xplory Cup Holder,"I thought it was a little much to buy this fancy cup holder after spending so much on the Stokke Stroller, but it has been a necessity for our walks since the stroller is so streamlined, there really isn't any other place to put things right in front of you.  I use it for my phone a lot more than I use it for drinks, because I always like to have my phone handy in case of an emergency with the baby.",5
"Stephan Baby Ultra Soft and Huggable Musical Praying Woolly Lamb, Blue","arrived as advertised....good soft product.  Only difference, it was a little smaller than I had expected.  Overall I was pleased.",4
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll",Love! Keeps his attention for hours. Does not hook on his car seat tho which is why I purchased it,4
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","I love this carseat.  I actually went to have it professionally installed, and the technician said it was the easiest-to-install seat EVER with the click-tight installation technology.  She was a fan of this seat.HOWEVER, the reason I did not give it 5 stars was because (after I purchased it), I read that it had dropped in rank in car seat ratings AS A BOOSTER.  It's still great as a 5-point harness seat.  As a booster, however, the change in the armrest design (from the Frontier 85) makes the lap belt sit too high on the child's lap.  Britax sells a ""SegureGuard"" clip to fix this, which we purchased for when we convert to a booster.  I feel the clip is something you should have anyway, to prevent submarining in boosters.Please check for yourself on the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety website (IIHS).  They test and rate all the carseats & boosters.",4
Squatty Potty 7&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"This was suggested by a friend and it took me a while to get it. I didn't think a stool to squat would help me poop anymore than the myriad of prunes I'm told to eat.OH OH OH how I was wrong. Since I have had this, i have had NO constipation. Put your feet up there and boom, out it comes. Works with my kids and i highly highly suggest it!",5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow Replacement Cover - Mauve,"Got this for my wife as a gift during her pregnancy.  She loved it.  I tried it out and loved it as well.  If you like the idea of a body pillow, but didn't like actually using one of the straight ones, this is for you.  If you're a cuddly or curl-up-to-sleep person, THIS IS A GODSEND!",5
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump with On the Go Tote,"I have been using this pump heavily for a year (full time working mom).  I have also owned the Avent ISIS Duo and an older style Medela PISA (circa 1990). Tthe 1990's Medela was the best.  It lasted through 3 kids worth of heavy, heavy pumping and was a work horse.  But they don't make 'em like that anymore, so pining away after it doesn't really help anyone!SUMMARY:If you are going to pump exclusively, you will need a good DOUBLE electric pump.  Depending on your situation, below are my recommendations:If you are have low supply, if you're struggling to pump enough, and/or do not respond to the pump well, I would recommend the ISIS over the PISA.  The ISIS is much better at extracting milk, BUT, it's also more cumbersome to use, the parts are heavy (so won't work great with a pumping bra) and there are a lot of parts to clean and keep track of.If you have good supply and your body responds well to pumping, then this Medela will probably be a decent (and convenient) pump for you.If you are OCD about cleanliness: Isis or Ameda Purely Yours (closed systems)IF YOU WANT THE GORY DETAILS (#5 being the most important, IMO)1. Reliability is questionable.  The pump stopped working after 4 months.  However, Medela immediately sent out a new pump, for free, which I receved the next business day.  Very good customer service.  Unfortunately, this happened on a Friday, so I was without the pump for an entire weekend.  I was lucky enough to have a back up pump, but not everyone has access to a back up pump.  Without a back up pump, it would have been pretty horrible.2. The suction is just so-so.  Even when both pumps were brand new, I could hear the motor leaking air.  I replaced the membranes, and the suction is improved marginally.  I respond very well to the pump, so this doesn't jeopardize my production.  However, if you don't respond well to the pump, it might affect your supply.3. The parts are light and easy to keep clean.  Compared to the Avent Isis Duo, the Medla parts are much lighter, there are fewer pieces to assemble, and the pieces are more durable.  The Isis had a few silicone parts that got gunky and gross after a while.  But all the Medela parts are plastic except the membranes, which are inexpensive to replace.  Also, the weight makes the Medela very easy to hold up with a pumping bra.  The Isis was so heavy, my pumping bra wasn't very effective keeping the horns attached to my boobs. So I had to hold them there and wasn't able to multi task while pumping.  Very inconvenient.4.  This is an open system.  Milk WILL get in the tubes. Dust and condensation will also gunk up the tubes.  If you're super OCD about everything being perfectly clean and sterile, be prepared to replace the tubing often.  Alternatively, look into closed system pumps (Isis and Ameda Purely Yours are closed). You will need to run your pump for a few minutes after each use to dry out the tubes or else mold will develop.  Kind of a pain, and this puts added wear on the motor (which is already weak, IMO, per my above comments).  You will need to replace the tubes every so often.  This also means it's only intended for one user.  This doesn't stop many people from buying used pumps, but technically, that is considered unsanitary and voids the warranty.5. You cannot control the speed and suction independent of each other.  There is a single dial.  If you set the dial to &#34;low&#34; = low suction, slow speed.  &#34;High&#34; = high suction, fast speed.  You cannot have low suction, fast speed.  Or high suction, slow speed.  On the ISIS, Ameda and old style Medela you can control the speed and suction separately.  This is an important feature, because each woman has a different combination of speed and suction they respond best to. And if you're struggling to produce, you need every advantage you can get and being able to completely customize the speed and suction could be a determining factor in your success. I always got the most milk using the ISIS with slow speed and long deep suction.  I could pump about 15-20% more using the ISIS.  But I had ample supply, so even with the Medela, I could keep up with my baby's demand.For me, the deciding factor in using the Medela as my primary pump was convenience.  But if I was struggling with supply, I would have used the ISIS as my primary pump.As a side note, you can pump directly into Evenflo and Dr. Brown's narrow neck bottles.  I used the Evenflo glass bottles and Medela collars and nipples.  Worked great.",3
Mommy's Helper Cushie Traveler,"I bought 2 of these. One to keep at my parent's house and one to throw in my bag when we are out. I love them. It's the perfect thing for my parents..My son visits a few times week and they can easily store this in their linen closet, no big, clunky potty, when he's not there. It folds up into quarters, so I have no problems carrying one in my bag around either. (admittedly, though, I do carry a huge bag) I keep it with a pack of Clorox wipes and just give it a good wipe down in between uses. The bag I store it in is machine washable so I toss that in the laundry once a week. I'd highly recommend this to anyone.",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Twin Electric Breast Pump,"I've been really impressed with this pump. I'm pumping exclusively due to having a preemie in the NICU and I can get more per pump from the Avent than the madela pumps they have at the hospital. The only thing that didn't work for me was the silicone massage insert that prevented good suction so I simply removed them and have had no problems since. I've been pumping every three hours for the last 2 weeks so I can't speak of how long the motor will last but so far no issues at all. It's easy to clean and put together and the bag it comes in is nice, but the bag is the size of a computer/messenger bag so if small is what you're looking for then beware of the size",5
HABA Kringelring Rattle Clutching Toy,I bought this for my older son when we were caught at a mall without any activities in my bag.  It has been a great distractor & teether for 2 babies now - and I see no signs that it will give out anytime soon!  We love HaBa products!!!,5
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White",I  love this gate! I  have tried MANY different types  and they  didn't seem sturdy  enough in our walk thru.  This one  is very sturdy on easy to open and close.  Worth every penny!,5
"OXO Tot Sprout Chair, Orange/Birch","As the grandmother, I didn't really need a super fab highchair, since my grand-daughter is only here now and then -BUT this is the best!! By the time I bought this one my grand-daughter was 2 and she can climb in and out of it easily.The tray is nice and big, so it accommodates various plate sizes. Before long, we can just convert it to be a chair youpull up to the table, without the tray and center leg divide. I actually bought a second one for my son, since he recognizedhow much easier and SAFER it was than the smaller one he had.",5
Munchkin A&amp;H Disposable Multi-Use Pad - 20 Pack,"I use these with every dirty diaper change. If there's any mess, it makes it so easy to just wrap it all up and toss it! I keep a box on his changing table for at home, and I always keep some in his diaper bag for travel, too. I don't like to use public changing tables, so I change him in the car and just use one of these on the seat underneath him. They work like a charm!",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","Exactly what was expected,  love that it is adjustable.  Good quality.  I am able to work and pump at the same time which is a lifesaver.",5
KidCo Angle Mount Safeway  - Black,I am very pleased with my decision to purchase two of these gates (top and bottom of stairs). The gate is very solid and is easy to operate one-handed. I like how you can limit to swing open only one direction.,5
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black",Love how deep the cup holders are! Perfect and secure on my Baby Jogger City Select.  I also tuck the magnet center flap in sometimes to have the middle section stay open... I can hear my cell phone better that way.,5
Bummis Tote Bag - Red - Small,The size of the bag is fine but the opening is very narrow with very little give to it. It's hard to stuff a poopy diaper with minimal touching of your hand and/or the edge of the bag.,3
"Orbelle 3-6T Toddler Bed, Natural","We've been using this for a few months now. It was easy for myself and my 3 year old to put together (she helped hold the boards while I attached them).I'm sure there's a weight limit and some reviews had said that even leaning on it cause issues. For us, I'm average weight, but currently pregnant (so not so average weight)  and I've sat on the bed with my toddler and with my three year old many times and it's fine. My husband is also average and he often leans on it when he puts our child to sleep. Again, I'm sure there is a weight limit that we've exceeded, so I wouldn't say to do that, but our experience is that it holds.I do wish we had one that had the rail run the full length of the bed on one side, but that is just preference. Thought I'd mention it as a consideration, but has nothing to do with the quality of the bed.It's affordable and we have no complaints.",5
Classy Kid Keep Me Coloring Creative Germ Defense Placemat - Pack of 20,"These are perfect for my toddler who can't be trusted with a dish yet. I don't mind if a plastic plate or bowl hits the floor at home, but restaurants all use breakable plates that I really don't want to worry about being thrown by my little one. At the same time, having worked in the restaurant biz myself, I know how gross those tables might be. I certainly wouldn't want to eat my own food off of one. And my kid is also too young to really do well with the little coloring sheets/ kids menus you get at a lot of places. She doesn't have the coordination yet to keep the paper in place while she colors.These placemats neatly solve both problems. They stick well, the pictures are great for coloring or for talking about (""What sound does the cow make?"", etc) while we're trying to keep her entertained during the wait for food. I love the fact that these do not used licensed characters, and they are not gender-segregated. And being biodegradable is the extra-awesome icing on the cake. I've just placed my second order of these. I know we'll eventually outgrow using these, but for now, they are definitely a must-have for our family.",5
"Munchkin Swaddle Angel 2 Count Blankets, X-Batik and Boomerang","i bought these as a gift, and I was very pleased with the packaging.  My sister loves them for her new baby and uses them often.  They are large and soft, and the patterns are even prettier in person.  The best part are the loops that allow you to hook the blanket and keep it in place, and even use as a nursing cover.  I wish I had these when my babies were born!",5
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","I've had my gate at the top of the stairs for a year and a half or so and the safety latch that prevents the door from swinging both ways just snapped off.  I thought this would be an easy piece to replace as it only has two screws on it to remove in order to take it off and could be easily switched out; however, summer infant does not sell a replacement part for this item.  They want you to buy the whole gate in order to replace a small piece of plastic.  Unfortunately, I tried a few other gates at the top of my stairs and this was the only one that fit.  Please keep this in mind before purchasing this gate.",1
"OsoCozy 6 Pack Prefolds Unbleached Cloth Diapers, Size 1","I've been using Osocozy prefolds ever since my daughter was born. At almost 1 year old and just under 20 lbs, she can still fit into the size 1 prefolds (i use the jelly roll fold and secure with a snappi to make the trimmest fit possible). Size 2 was way too big and I actually cut 4 inches of length off of all of them (after prepping them, of course) and stitched the edges to prevent fraying. There is no way any baby would ever utilize all that extra length. I use Thirsties duo wraps and compared to a size 2 completely unbuttoned thirsties cover, the size 2 prepped prefolds were 5 inches longer than the cover.They are very absorbent, resistant to stains, and get very clean in the wash. I have recommended these prefolds to friends.",4
"Combi BPA Free Teether, 6 Months","I like the fact that it has a carrying case. It's a bit thinner than the other teethers like Munchkins, Nuby, etc.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",This is a great walker because it's easy to maneuver. My son loves being in it. I love that you could pop off the the musical play thing and it becomes a food tray. That is a plus for me cause it keeps him busy while I get chores done.,5
"Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey","I have tried five different potty seats, and this is easily the best.  We have an elongated oval toilet, and this seat fits perfectly without slipping.  Next favorite is the Baby Bjorn seat...but is double the price of the Prince Lionheart.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Fantastic product. We absolutely love this for our 19-month-old; the tray system is easy to clean and so compact. My only regret? That we didn't get it months ago!,5
"My Brest Friend Original Pillow, Bluebells","After one week of trying to breastfeed with a stack of four pillows, my back was killing me.  I was getting less nervous about dropping the baby off the precariously balanced stack, but still limited in where I could sit while feeding (not in bed, because the floor was too far away).  Not having a nursing pillow was not working out.My Brest Friend is the only nursing pillow I've tried.  It is a huge improvement over standard bed pillows or nothing.Plusses:- Much better than a stack of standard bed pillows or just holding baby up with no pillows.  Within three feedings, I felt much better about using the pillow, and my back did not hurt some much after feeding.  This is way more comfortable than any improvised home alternatives.- Cheaper than buying waterproof covers for a stack of standard bed pillows.  After all, if you have a baby on it, eventually, there will be a diaper leak.  I didn't care what color the cover on the nursing pillow was, so I just picked the color that was on sale.Negatives:- The cover for the My Brest Friend is not waterproof, and the inside pillow material is made of foam that absorbs moisture.  If you have a baby on it, eventually, there will be a diaper leak.  That's going to go through the cover and into the pillow.  You can pat the foam with water, but the pillow will be wet for a while, and eventually I suspect the baby will start to smell the accumulated spills.  I realize that most of the manufacturing cost for this is the material used for the cover, but any type of waterproof layer, even a cheap vinyl cover under the cloth would have been very welcome.-  Boppy has a waterproof cover www.amazon.com/Boppy-Water-Resistant-Protective-Cover/dp/B002WDEIVA/ , but I couldn't even find one for sale separately for My Brest Friend.- I have to hunch over to nurse with this, or lift the baby's head a few inches off the pillow.  For perspective, I'm 5ft 6inch, have a long torso, wore size 8 before pregnancy and only gained 10 pounds from pregnancy.  The other reviewer who mentioned hunching over said she was 4ft something with a slight build.  In a sense, it's a one-size-fits-all pillow, and plus size reviewers say it's great for them.  With thicker thighs, the height might work out better.  Maybe I'm supposed to have my feet up on something, so that I can control the height of the pillow with my thighs.  That sort of works, but it angles the pillow so that baby slides into me, and it's alarming for both of us.Other:- I suspect a nursing pillow is only for the newborn phase.  Once the baby develops neck muscles, I think he will be able to do more of the work supporting himself up.  Also, people breast feed in public with nursing covers, but I have never seen someone carrying a nursing pillow around for portable breastfeeding.  So, I suspect the nursing pillow is for short term use, and will be outgrown in a few months.  This may mitigate issues with not having a waterproof cover.If you plan to breastfeed, definitely get a nursing pillow.  This one was a huge improvement over standard bed pillows, and a big enough improvement that I am not going to try others.  As you shop, if you see any nursing pillows that have a waterproof cover, or any waterproof covers for popular pillows, those are worth investigating and paying more for.",4
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Cuddle Cove Rocking Seat, Winslet",absolutely waste of time and money!!!!  garbage instruction and product!!!  Not clear how to assemble and the assembly guide is ridiculously useless!!!!  The parts were damaged easily during assembly!!!!!  DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL!!!,1
Tiny Love Super Mat,"We have no carpeting in our house so I bought this interactive mat for my 5 month old. I put a foam mat underneath and it's soft enough for my baby to fall over and not cry. When my baby isn't playing with toys on this mat, she'll get distracted with the textures on the mat or the other attachments.",5
Kidsline - Luxury Blanket - Lavender,"These blankets are AMAZING.  They wear very well, my daughter has used the green one every night for over four years.  I bought two others, thinking the green one would wear out, but it hasn't.  These are super soft, wash very well and there is no fraying.  Awesome baby gift.",5
*The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Lemon - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/&quot;THE ART OF CURETM&quot; Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),"Well, the first one broke so I left a negative review. However, I was promptly emailed and given the certificate of authenticity and a promise to send me a new one. Hopefully the first one was just a fluke. I will revise if the second one breaks. But I tell you what, customer service was GREAT. She's a homeopathic mom who has a few trusted manufacturers. And she wanted to do anything possible to help me and my teething son. I am thrilled and that is why I am giving a second necklace a try.",5

"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","I loved these shades until it got cold here in Pa, and they won't stick now. Not worth buying if they don't work for more than half a year. Especially since it is very sunny in the winter time and my kids hate having the sun in their eyes. Can't return them now cause we used them for the warmer months.",1

"Ju-Ju-Be Changing Pad Bag, Midnight Eclipse",I bought this to match my other cobalt blossoms changing stuff and ended up returning it for a padded changing pad.  I realized that I may as well put the baby on a towel or a burp cloth.  I can't recall the name of it but I found a fantastic padded changing pad on Amazon that we love - look around.  This one looks cute but is kinda small and you can find better ones out there...,3
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White","This piece looked great after assembly!  I found out that I should have been more careful in putting nails in too deeply.  Some of the tips of the nails touched through the wood around the front edge of the dressing  pad frame. (I'm going to try to just carefully hammer those tips back in.  Hopefully, the finish will not crack.)I didn't feel there was a need for the piece directly above the cubbies.  I will probably take it off, for it shortens the size for bigger baskets.  Otherwise, this piece is super!!!  It looks great in my future granddaughter's nursery w/the matching chest dresser!",5
Boppy Prenatal Total Body Pillow,"I am a tummy sleeper.  With my belly growing, I was unable to sleep on my stomach and couldn't get comfortable on my side and couldn't breather well while laying on my back.  I was miserable!  I bought this pillow and it literally saved my sleep.  It is so comfortable.  My daughter is now 3 months old and I still sleep with this pillow.  It is a large pillow, but my husband and I have a King size bed so it hasn't been an issue.  The cover comes off easily so it can be washed.  I have been using it since I was around 20 weeks pregnant and it still hasn't lost its size or ""fluffiness"".",5
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"First of all I live in India. The pumps you get in medical stores look like bicycle horns, and the good ones==there's very little choice (I've seen a philips Avent, a Pigeon, and a Farlin, which are among the good ones, but I've only seen single models of each of these brands without much choice in stores). I just wanted to be sure, so after reading rave reviews for this particular one, I decided to go for it.I did not plan to pump too much because I work from my home office, but I have an oversupply and manually expressing milk to relieve the pressure was way too time consuming. I didn't want to end up with blocked ducts mastitis and all the other problems that come with oversupply. Before this pump arrived I was already battling a clogged pore.If you have a good supply of milk (evidenced by the fact that y our baby is satisfied after feeds, not by the amount you can hand express), then you will be able to pump enough with this manual pump. I used to manually express into a graduated bottle to see how much I could produce, and I would get 2 oz a side after say 20 minutes each and a lot of pressing and pain. With the Medela Harmony I am able to produce 4 oz from one side within about 10 minutes, no pain, no need to struggle. I don't even push the pump all the way.Pros:-This manual pump is good if you are an SAHM, pump to relieve oversupply, or pump infrequently for other reasons.-It comes with an extra bottle, lid, nipple, stand, and cap.-The two pumping strengths simulate the initial suckling to sitmulate letdown and the slower, longer suckling motions of babies.-The suction is pretty strong but it can be minimized if the handle is pushed down only part way.-It comes with an instruction manual.Cons:-The apparatus looks daunting at first with little parts here and there, but it's easy to get the hang of after a single dismantle/reassembly.-The pumping mechanism is directly connected to the bottle and flange, etc., so they come in direct contact with each other. This means everytime you need to use it, it needs to be sterilized/sanitized.-There is a tiny white &#34;washer&#34;-like ring that attaches the pump to the rest of the assembly. This came off while I was sterilizing my Harmony the second time after I bought it. Luckily I noticed it, figured out where it goes and popped it back on. Without this washer the suction refused to work. So watch out for the tiny parts.",5
"Dream On Me, 3 in 1 Portable Convertible Crib, Cherry",Our nieces bedroom is small.  You add all the other furniture and the space became tight.  This Crib was an excellant purchase.  All the pieces were there and assembly wasn't too bad.  The crib is beatiful and seems to be built well.,5

Eddie Bauer Soothing Comfort Bouncenette,"We bought this product used before the baby was born and it has been a hit.  The vibrate option has kept him sleeping peacefully in the living room while the family moves around him.  I find the noises not at all soothing, but they seem to work for him!  The seat reclines fully, great for a newborn; now that he is 13 weeks old we have adjusted it so it inclines.  The biggest negative is that he is about to outgrow it so it is only good for about 3 1/2 months.  A big plus - the zip up screen.  We have two dogs in the house and by closing the screen we keep the baby protected from inquiring, slobbery noses.",4

DEX Products Electric Baby Food Processor,"I love, love, love this little thing! I can't believe how well it works and purees EVERYTHING, so smooth. I used a different product and made a fruit blend and was left with chucks, seeds and pulp from the oranges. Then I put everything in this one and it was a perfect liquid blend. I won't use anything else for my baby. It's small and light weight and can't wait until my little one is older and I can try to mash up whatever daddy and I are eating. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to make their own baby food.",5
LASSIG Green Label Neckline Bag - Black Melange,"My girlfriend absolutely loves it. I wanted to wait to have our baby before reviewing, and now that we're using it everyday, I can finally say that it's a great product. Tons of pockets and space, great fashion design.Only reason it's not 5 stars is that there is not really any easy way to attach it to the stroller. There should be one little clip/strap on each side to attach to the stroller like I have on my diaper dude bag... So to put it under the handles you have to just ""hang"" it there by the shoulder strap but it's not ideal.",4

"BabyHawk Mei Tai Baby Carrier, Black/Lime Motifs","Love this carrier! I purchased the BabyHawk Mei Tai because I was looking for something to easily wear my son on my back. I chose this over the Ergo mainly because of the price, but I'm extremely happy with my purchase. This carrier is versatile and comfortable. There is just enough padding to make the comfortable on my shoulders and back, and I love the variety of carries. My seven month old's favorite is a high back carry. There is a bit of a learning curve (especially with a back carry) as with any wrap or carrier, but once you've gotten used to it, it's quick to get on and off.",5
"Combi All in One Activity Walker, Pink","Hi, we got this walker yesterday, it and my 7 month old has been inseperable ever since. He reaches for it if we walk by it he loves to honk the horn and push the buttons. I don't know what people are complaining about the bar in the back for, my son is 31 inches tall in the 70th percentile for hight and the bar don't bother him (have it pushed all the way back.) I am glad to have found this walker on amazon after getting ripped off of one on ebay. This item is no longer sold in babies r us or toys r us stores in this color in my area. They said I would have to go up north to get one and their not sold online. Red was the only color I wanted and the Jeeps wheels don't rotate (at least the one I had didn't). For those of you worried about the price go find something with in your budget the other colors are cheaper because you can't get this one anywhere else in some states. My son hasn't figured out he can move in it yet (he's never had a walker my older son had the jeep) but, he's figured out how to bounce in it and he loves that feature. I wish we could post pictures with our reveiws because I have the cutest smiley pictures from my baby in it and we all know how hard those are to get.",5
"Philips AVENT Tempo BPA-Free Liners, 8 Ounce,  100-Count","I love the Tempo system, because the rings are sealed (since it is a collapsable liner you do not need a vent) and do not leak like the regular Avent bottles do.  Also, you never need worry about BPA!",5
"Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 5 (2 Mint Green, 2 White, 1 Blue)","I grew up pinning diapers on younger cousins, so I was skeptical, but they are super easy to use, and while the &#34;snappi&#34; can bite if you're not careful, pins can stick, and at least the snappi is plastic, not a metal spike! :) The only thing I wish would have been included was cleaning instructions. I use one per day and swish in warm water and mild detergent after use, but I'm not sure this is the best way to ensure the longevity of the product.",4
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock",We are still using this for our daughter in our Subaru Outback.

Safety 1st Magnetic Tot Lok Complete Set,"Such a great idea but...installation is ridiculously difficult but I suffered through to protect my child.  I ended up with holes in my nice furniture and a system that will not work.  My entertainment center is a hardwood, maybe that's a factor I don't know, but my cabinets aren't thick enough for the extension slug so I'm at a loss.  Maybe I'll look for a stronger magnet and try again since the damage is already done.Oh well I guess that's why they make wood filler and stain, just add that to my list of a million projects.",1
"Dr. Bloom's Chewable Jewels Necklace Circle, Lavender","I just got my chewable jewels in the mail, I ordered the blue circle necklace and bracelet to wear while my 4 month old daughter teeths. I was hoping it would look a bit more stylish, it does look like a cheap, plastic, chew toy. Although I am impressed by how stretchy the cord is, so as she gets stronger she wont be able to break it. Also it had a slight plasticky smell that I am hoping is from the packaging since the jewelry is phthalate free. I look forward to having a teether that cant fall on the floor, but because of the appearance I wont be buying any more of this brand.",3
"Solarsafe Stroller , Playard &amp; Pack 'n Play Net - 85% UV protection","This is an excellently designed product. The reflective outer coating  keeps the sun out, while the dark inside allows the baby to see out. Our five-month old is really enjoying the stroller rides now. The integral packing bag is a nice feature for putting the net away. You can't lose the bag because it is attached. The net  is easy to put onto the stroller and is plenty large. Very happy with the purchase.",5
DaVinci Emily Mini Crib - White,I was very happy to find such a nice crib at such an affordable price. I put it together on my own and was pleased how easily it went up. It fits well in the smaller space we have and looks especially beautiful/elegant for the cost. It's also very easy to move around if need be. Great Purchase. I would highly recommend. I do agree with others about the 2 in. foam mattress though and will invest in a thicker higher quality one.,5
EddieBauer Lht wt Travel System-Edgewood,"Do NOT buy this travel system because the straps on the carseat simply fall out while you are driving!  If you call the customer service dept of Costco, they'll send you replacement straps, but I haven't gotten them yet to see if they work.  I'm just glad I haven't been in an accident before this.&#60;br /&#62;The wheels squeak too, but that is unimportant considering your child can fall out of the carseat.",1
"Britax Boulevard 70 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","I bought this seat for my 17 month old daughter and we love it.  The installation was super easy and rock solid in my Sienna.  The strap adjustment is smooth and did not require much effort on my part.  I plan to buy a second one for our other car so we can get rid of the awful first convertible we purchased, the Safety First Complete Air LX.  We loved the Britax seats we used 9 years ago and, so far, this one has been just as wonderful.  It's worth every penny.",5
"Baby Aspen Let The Fin Begin Terry Shark Robe, Blue, 0-9 Months","Got this for a baby shower gift and it was a huge hit!! The material is standard, not super soft or anything.  I am sure the sizing is pretty accurate for age 0-9 months.",5
Stroll-Air Double Stroller Organizer,"After a ton of research and seemingly few good double stroller options, I settled on this without much to go on the way of reviews. I wanted something that would span the entire width of our double stroller's handle bar and this turned out to fit perfectly. The Velcro straps actually have alot more length to stretch further if needed. I'm able to secure the straps tight enough so that the console holds pretty rigid, without sagging or moving across the entire width. It would work even better with the regular City Mini double stroller, which has a perpendicular bar in the center of the handle bar. The console has two separate storage compartments with space in between them to rest over that perpendicular bar. The cup holders are big enough to securely hold large drinks, like the souvenir cups at Six Flags. The storage compartments have a lot of space for all of multiple wallets, phones, keys, maps, sunglasses, and snacks to fit with room to spare. The magnets that secure the compartment covers could be stronger, but are fine for when the stroller is in use. I don't think they'll hold well when the stroller is folded up and there are still items in the pockets, but we don't keep anything stored in there when the stroller isn't in use so it's not a problem for us.",5
Prince Lionheart Warmies Wipes Warmer,"I use this full of warm water and a wipes solution and dip in baby washcloths.  The washcloths it came with are the best I've ever seen!  THey are very thick and soft, so I decided to use them for her baths and use thin baby washcloths for the wiping.  The warmer keeps the water the perfect temperature.",5
"JJ Cole Car Seat Canopy, Aqua Drops","I got this cover so that I could keep my son in the shade when he is in his stroller (I have the Graco frame stroller which has no shade on it), and also to keep germs away when I have to take him out around people since he is only 4 weeks old.  The cover is nice and lightweight fabric, which is good since I am in FL and it is already very warm here.  It fits snugly on the carseat (Graco Snugride), but you can always peek through the velcro and check on baby with no problems.  I actually leave on side down when the baby is in the car, and it keeps the sun from coming in the window there too.  Only drawback is that you have to have the handle in the upright position to use the shade, since the straps attach there.  You have to remove the cover from the bottom the seat to move the handle back.  other than that, it is great!",4

Haven't tried the easy unassemble for easy storage yet. GREAT activity set for baby!,5
Bubble Guppies Stacking Cups,"I paid $2 more on amazon than I would have at Walgreens, where this is sold for $9.99. Wish the parts of each &#34;cup&#34; would stick together, but they don't. If you pick up a cup, the top separates from the bottom. Kinda lame.",1

"DaVinci Classic Sleigh Glider and Ottoman, Beige/Espresso Legs","I love my glider.  I only gave it 4 stars because I have only taken it for a test spin, although our little one should arrive any day now.  I do agree with some of the  comments that it can be a little snug in the hips and I wish the back was a bit taller for head/neck support.  But overall a very comfortable chair thus far and I really enjoy how padded the seat cushion is compared to other chairs I have tried.  Looks good too :)",4
"American Baby Company Organic Cotton Quilted Waterproof Sheet Saver, Natural","LOVED these sheet savers. As the name states, these saved us many a sheet change. They pilled up a tiny bit with many washings, but stayed soft and held up great. We still use them around the house for when we need a waterproof surface, even though baby is past the sheet saver stage.",5
Phil Teds Classic Single Child Stroller w Doubles Kit,"I loved the stroller for the first 2 years, it was handy, slim and a great stroller to take shopping as its not wide and bulky like other double strollers. However over time the quality just in NOT there. The fabric has ripped and the internal piping is sticking out and one of the plastic buttons you push in to fold the stroller has now snapped off. For a $350-$600 stroller I would have expected this to last must longer. If you are only using for a year or two great, but if you expect it to last the time...well it just might now :O(",3

"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom",I absolutely love this monitor. As a new mom I researched and researched many different kinds of video monitors and decided on this one. What an awesome choice I made. This monitor is very clear and has awesome night vision. I wanted to be able to see baby breathing and  it is so clear that you can see the rise and fall of their chest. The audio is great and I love that there are also light indictors to notify you if baby cries. It is very easy to use and set up. Gives me great peace of mind!,5

Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"Between our 2 children we have had both of the top selling Fisher Price models - the Ocean Wonders and the Papasan cradle swings.  While we have been happy with both, our favorite by far is the Ocean Wonders.  The mobile on it is SO much better, with the hanging toys and the lights.  My oldest son actually still plays with the fish toys that hung from his swing mobile when he was a baby -- he loves them to this day!  My youngest son got the papasan swing instead and while it functions basically the same the mobile just isn't very interesting in comparison.  Our papasan swing broke recently and Fisher Price (excellent customer service) is cutting us a check for a replacement -- we'll be getting another Ocean Wonders instead of the papasan.",5
Edushape Magic Creations Bath Playset - Under the Sea,"I was so excited to give these to my son for Christmas!  He is now 22 months and loves cars, trucks, buses etc.  I thought he would love these.  He does not.  He has no interest in playing with them.  He has no interest in sticking them to the side of the tub or anything.  It's strange, because he loves to take his toy cars and trucks into the tub and line them up on the side, but these, nope!  Not an inkling of interest.To me, these are cute and stick well to the tub (I've done that myself easily when showing him what they do).",3
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I used 5 pillows before, 2 for my head to be elevated, below my bottom, between my legs to relieve SI related pain and last below my belly to prevent cramping of the abdominal muscles in sideline. Now I just use one and havent slept better. I have been using it for the past 2 weeks since week 20.PROSAble to use it in several different ways to:LYING DOWNWear it with Long side on my back in sideline and it supports my entire back and stabilises SI joint instability relieving related pain, the section goes between your legs and it helps with SI instability and pain, it curves under stomach and supports it relieving the cramps on my ab muscles.Roll with it between your legs and it is more comfortableI have tucked under my hip bones when lying on stomachHead is elevated enough to prevent refluxSITTING UPUse it on soft couches that cause SI instability and painDecrease seat depth in couches and helped me sit uprightCONSWhen you roll depending on where it works best for you, you have to reposition. Yes it woke me up but i went right back to sleep.It takes a couple of nights of playing around with it to figure what works best for you. My sheets would get tangled up, back position worked better for me during my second trimester etc But once you have got it down, its such a relief!I dont know if the cover is cotton, but it got a lil hot for me, i just cover the exposed potion with my sheet and im fine.I might have to stitch a spare cotton cover that goes over it that is less complicated to put on.It took me 2 days of interrupted sleep because of pain especially while rolling to invest in this. But its been worth the money. Sleep deprivation during pregnancy is just a trigger for everything else, its bad enough you have to wake up to pee. Havent slept better.I am 5'4, my friend who is 6'1 recommended it to me, so it works for different heights as well. Definitely give it a shot.",5
"BOB Sport Utility Single Stroller, Blue","This stroller is awesome! We use it to walk our baby and dogs out in the country on a dirt road. She sleeps, they run, and everyone comes home happy. It's rugged, but also has a smooth ride. It is one of our favorite purchases.",5

Soon as I received the item, I studied it and thought to myself that it would actually be something for me too since it's very flexible and very well adjustable! It's a very good buy!!!",5
"Foundations Quad Four Child Stroller, Blue","Positives:We enjoy using this stroller. The kids get a real kick out of sitting next to a buddy. It snugly fits through most doorways. The kids fit well, even the three-year-olds. An infant car seat can fit in one of the back seats and still have room for a toddler sitting next to them. I also like the automatic braking system that activates whenever you release the handle. It folds up well and just fits into the back of a 12-passenger Ford Heavy Duty van.Negatives:We probably don't use it as much as we would if it were easier to get it into and out of the van or at least a bit lighter. It is very heavy and awkward for one person to try and pick up or load. Also, when in the folded position, the wheels don't turn, so you must either fully assemble it or try and carry it when moving it between places. Because it is heavier, it is harder to take it on unpaved trails and it easily sinks and gets stuck in mud and gravel. It does okay on the larger bark chips often found at parks as long as there are two or less kids riding at the time.On a more technical note, the back seats are held up by two buckles. On ours, one of the sets of buckles is too tight to allow the ends to meet, so it is permanently in a reclined position. This is something that should be checked upon arrival (we didn't because we were using the back seats for infants and didn't need them in the upright position for quite some time)",4
Stokke Sleepi Mattress,"This mattress is extremely hard, which I guess is safe, but doesn't seem very comfy for baby.  It serves it's purpose. It is just overpriced because you have no other options when you buy a Stokke Sleepi crib.",2
UPPAbaby PiggyBack Ride Along Board,"My 2.5 year old son always wants to walk places...until we get very far from home or the car and suddenly he's just too tired to go on.  This is perfect because it's there with the stroller (I have a baby girl) and he can pop on when he gets worn out.  He feels like he has the freedom to walk and I don't have to worry about him begging to be carried.  It snaps on pretty easily, but be aware that you have to remove it to fold up the stroller.  One problem is that I feel like my feet bump into it when we're walking (I'm not very tall, although my husband who is 6'4 has the same problem), so I end up hunching over a bit.  It's slightly uncomfortable, but much better than carrying my toddler, so I think it's a small price to pay.",5
"Milk Dreams Sleep Bra (Small, White)","It said it was my size, but it's so small I fall out!  Not cool.  If you're bigger busted, it's not a great bra.",1
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot","Since our son spends a lot of time in his forward facing baby carrier, it is great to have a way to keep his pacifier off the ground when he inevitably spits it out. It leaves my hands free and I don't have to worry about it falling into something horrible, which it always does. The metal clip on the strap has a locking mechanisms which holds it quite firmly, yet allows for it to be quickly and easily taken off.My one complaint about this thing is the package it came in. The little plastic T which held it onto its cardboard backer left a frayed hole in the strap, despite my efforts to carefully cut it off with some scissors. I don't think it has damaged it structurally, but it just looks ugly. Think about some better packaging!",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Sea Turtle",I like that there is a timer and this does not stay on all night. I think my daughter gets better rest that way. Having this helps calm her fears.,5
"Regalo Extra Tall Guardian Expandable Gate, White","In April, my husband and I bought this gate so we could keep our dogs out of the living room and off the carpet. We've been pleased with it, until this weekend when I holding one of our dogs in my left arm, and trying to loosen and remove the gate with my right. My forearm got caught in the middle of the 2 metal pieces sliding together, immediately leaving a giant welt and bruise. As incredibly painful as it is, I am so glad this happened to me and not my niece or nephew! Their fingers could fit in the space, and if it had happened their fingers would have broken!! I am so disappointed in this product, but glad we don't yet have children of our own for this to happen to.",2
Jellycat Bashful Lamb Soother,Jelly cat is a fantastic name brand but I don't find this particular product all that cute so I'm sending it back.,3
"DwellStudio Baby Squares Fitted Crib Sheet, Dove Grey",Thses crib sheets fit well and wash well. They have lasted the last 9 months and still look new! Love them,5
"Soothing Dreams Monistor with Remote Control, Fisher-Price","This product should be recalled!!! Within two weeks of bringing our son home, the light bulb burned out. We quickly discovered that the bulb can not be easily replaced. There was a constant clicking sound from the first day and within six weeks, the reception worsened to the point of pure static. The interference with our cordless phone was obscene -- far worse than the new monitor I've purchased since.",1
Kids Line Willow Organic 4-Piece Crib Set,"My neice and her husband are very much into hunting.  I had to find something that could be used for both a boy or a girl, and also something that had to do with hunting.  I thought this was very cute and it also had deer on it, which was right up the fether's alley.  They are very pleased withit.  Thank you so much for having this item.  Shirley Erlandson",4
"Stork Craft Rocking Horse, Oak",Arrived in time for my grandsons first horse for Christmas and it is soo beautiful. Came when promised and is very well made and easy to assemble. This I recommend to anyone looking for a great rocking horse it is well made and worth the price not a thin piece of wood and the finish is excellent.,5
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"My daughter was tired of her 'baby' booster with the buckles. This booster works perfectly for my 3 year old, doesn't slip around in the chair (wood), fits perfectly, color options are great, super comfy and perfect size for her to reach the table.",5
"Evenflo Home D&eacute;cor Wood Gate, Natural Oak","I like this gate. It swing easily. We have a lab and a weenier dog and this gate funtions well to keep them in the family room. If I had one complaint it would be how the hardware goes together. It has an gap between the two pieces to allow metal brackets. I think it would be stronger if the two wooden pieces were up against each other. Our lab is about 90 lbs and puts his front paws on it. It stands up to that so I'm pleased.For childen this would be a perfect gate. Slats are close enough that even the weenier dog can't get her head through! It is attractive also, unlike the metal or plastic kind that look like prison gates.",4
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia",This was a great investment for us. It was easy to set up and we had no problem. We haven't taken it out to use at restaurant.,5
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,I have twins that are 10 months old and was thrilled to try this product.  We couldn't use our old bath ring seat because our new house has a tub with a textured bottom.  Problem solved.  This seat attaches to the side of the tub quite securely.  The seat has nicely rounded edges to keep from scraping the baby's legs.  A+++++,5
"Kids Line Velour/Sherpa Blanket, Fleur",My daughter loves this blanket! She will only fall asleep with part of it against her cheek. It is a very generous size and works well for our warm Texas nights. It has remained super soft even after washing. If I had know it was this great in advance I would have bought 2!,5
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","I bought it for my friend, he felt that the product is very practical and very comfortable.I think he like it.",4
Superyard Colorplay Ultimate Playard,We have twin 8 month olds just crawling around.  They can get into anything and everything.  We use this mainly to cover our whole living room so they have a large play area.  We also purchased the 2 section Play yard extension and having the 2 extra panels sure helps.,5
Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,worked awesome for my porta crib i would still be useing it today if it didnt fly out of the truck while i was moving,5
Medela Breastmilk Collection and Storage Bottles 5oz (150ml) - 2 Each BPA FREE,I use these bottles everyday with the Medela Symphony pump & they are great. I like that they are kind of small bottles & not so bulky like other types.,5
Tinkle Tube Toilet Aid,LOVE the tinkle tube!!!!  Perfect for public bathrooms.,5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",I am pumping exclusively since my 3 week old has had such difficulties with breastfeeding. Having my hands free to pump after 3 weeks of pumping with the ameda double electric breast pump is a relief. I highly recommend this product. Fit is great. I am a wearing a 36C right now and bought the S/M size.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open Top Take-Along Swing with Music and Mobile,"This swing is a great buy. We received it as a gift when our first was born. We already had a big swing, so I wondered how much use we would get out of it! The answer is...a TON! The size is great, I keep it in the living room because it takes up less space and I keep the big swing in the bedroom. It runs FOREVER on 3 C batteries. The music is a bit annoying to me, but the kids seem to like it. The ""mobile"" was in the way and annoying so I ripped it off and I am much happier with it now! It folds up nicely and travels well!",4
Fisher-Price Kid Utility Vehicle,"Saw a family with one at a mall and stopped and asked where to find it.  Only place we found it was here online, so we ordered.  It does take up some room, but no more so than a large single or double stroller.  Compacts fairly well and only takes about a minute to get ready for use.  With the generous weight rating, I can even pull my 9 and 6 year old together (without a great deal of effort).  Very stable.In the past couple of days, at least 5 people of stopped me to ask about it and countless others have remarked things like ""cool"", ""awesome"" and ""look at that"" as we go by.My only real complaint is that, unlike a wagon, the pull-handle does not turn the wheels - you must apply pressure in the direction you want to turn for the front wheels to head that direction.  Works fine while moving, but not too well when trying to turn it sitting still.  The only other ""negative"" is that I have long legs and sometimes run into my own heels while pulling.  I would like it if the handle were longer, but it so, wouldn't fold as compact.I would highly recommend this for anyone with multiple kids, especially younger kids that don't like a stroller.  My 2 year old can't wait to ride in it, something that we used to have to fight about for the stroller.  A fantastic product.",4
"The First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce",very satisfied with the product and the speed in which i received it  i would recommend this product and this provider.,5
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free High-Heat Resistant Classic Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology, 3-Pack","We like these bottles a lot. The plastic feels sturdy and they hold up well in the dishwasher. They are easily to put together and take apart, don't leak, and our daughter easily transitions between breast and bottle.",4
Medela Lactina Select Hospital Grade Breast Pump - BPA Free #016SC01,I love this pump.  I also have a Medela Pump in Style and it doesn't compare.  The Lactina produces more milk and is significantly more comfortable.The seller has amazing customer service and is exceptionally responsive.,5
KidCo Swivel Cabinet &amp; Drawer Lock,Bottom line.  These work and they are cheap.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because 1 of the screws snapped.  If they get stronger screws its automatic 5 stars.,4
"Kids Line Embroidered Boa Blanket, Jungle Walk",This blanket is so soft and it is also very durable. It has been so hard to find Jungle Walk themed items. So I was very pleased to find this blanket,5
Snoogle Chic Total Body Pillow,My wife loves it and missed it A LOT when we slept over at some friends without it. Good choice,5
Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobile,it is very soundly then rolling (rolling motor sound). that sound is louder than music. one of the three hanging toys does not rolls.. than you are purchasing such thing for such amount it should work properly! i am unsatisfied!,1
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty",My daughter has special needs and needs a car seat with good support and this seat has it.We love it.,5
Nuby Hot Safe Spoons 4 Pack BPA FREE,Arrived fast and perfect&#8230;good spoons&#8230;dishwasher safe..baby likes to teeth on them as wellso light but not too light&#8230;def recommend,5
"Sleepy Wrap Classic Wrap Baby Carrier, Dark Pink, 0-18 Months","This is not a sleepy wrap. This is a boba wrap- the company that took over the 'sleepy wrap'. It says Boba Wrap right on the package and on the product. They are not the same thing, but close enough that I will try it out. I loved the original sleepy wrap, and this one appears similar -except it is wider and the fabric feels thinner and more stretchy.Please stop advertising this as the Classic Sleepy Wrap when its not.",3
"Jeep Traveler Tandem Stroller, Spark","I needed a double stroller for my one year old and newborn and we took a chance on buying this one without seeing in person. I loved the fact that almost any car seat fits into it, it buckles in place like a seat belt. I have a small car so I really needed a smaller tandem stroller. It folded up about as small as my Safety 1st single stroller but the downside is it is heavier. If you don't mind lifting 40lbs in and out of the trunk it's a great. It took some learning on how to open and close but thanks to a couple You Tube videos I quickly got the hang of it. My only complaint is that the back canopy keeps falling off but I can deal with that. It also doesn't turn great but I don't do a lot of walking so its fine. Price wise I didn't want something too expensive because I plan on getting a side by side umbrella stroller when the newborn is older. It's a great buy for the price and I'm very happy with it.",5
Puj Snug - Ultra Soft Spout Cover (Aqua),"I just bought this faucet cover for our 9  month old son. It is soft, adorable and I can see how it would fit on multiple sizes of faucets. Unfortunately the material is rather flimsy and after a few seconds of my teething baby standing up at the faucet and putting his mouth on it, he bit a piece right off. I didn't realize at first and had to fish it out of his mouth on the changing table--thank god i saw it before he swallowed it as it was a decent size. They should make the product thicker and more durable so this does not happen and then it would be perfect, right now I worry it is a choking hazard!",2
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!","Very large, but light and stretchty. works great to double swaddle our fussy little monkey. very breathable so she doesn't overheat.",5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","We received this as a shower gift, and it's been tremendously useful.  We have a separate bassinet for night time, so really only use it for daytime naps.  It's lightweight and easy to move from room to room.  When I study I can rock it with my foot, using very little effort, and the baby will sleep peacefully and let me do what I need.",5
Star Wars Jedi Forces Full Comforter,"This comforter is really nice and the graphics are clear and colorful.  This is the second one I've purchased.  I wanted one as a backup should the original one ever wear out.  I have washed my original one numerous times and it still looks as good as when I got it. It has gotten a little softer with washings, but I think that is a plus. I have the full size and it covers my sons full size bed nicely.  I think this comforter is a super buy.  It arrived in the time promised.",5
CoCaLo Daniella Crib Bedding Set 8 Piece,,5
ThumbGuard LG (7-15 yrs.),"I got this for my daughter when she was almost 5 and it worked successfully. She wanted to stop sucking her thumb before she started Kindergarten to be a ""big girl"". She didn't fight with me about wearing it. In fact, she would remind me to put it on her after baths or when she got home from preschool. After about a month, she no longer sucked her thumb. BUT, that is when she started biting her nails. Since the product worked for her, I decided when my son turned 4 that it was time to get one for him. He hated it! He cried when I put it on and successfully pulled his thumb out of it every time. It didn't matter how tight I put it on, if he wanted it off, he would just pull on it to slip his thumb out. The only way to have kept it on, would of been to put it so tight that it would nearly cut his circulation off. (Which of course, would of been way to tight)  My point is...The child has to be willing to stop sucking thier thumb or be under constant watch so they won't slip their thumb out, in order for this product to work. My now 5 year old son still sucks his thumb :(  Also, I would reccommend getting extra wrist bracelets.",3
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",This is perfect for the spring/summer months because it's not too hot.  I intend on getting a thicker one for the winter months!  I love the fact that I don't have to worry about extra blankets in the crib and my baby really seems to be comfortable at night.,5
Cute Rabbit LED Changing Colour Bunny Night Light Lamp Decor Party Kids Gift (Soccer),The product appears larger than it's actual size and is cheaply made.  Would not recommend. Came in a damaged packaged and looked as if it had been opened and returned already.  Tab had been taken out so do not think battery will last too long.,1
"Stork Craft Hoop Glider, Espresso/Beige","The glider is great, however, there is a tad bit of false advertising in the title, stated Glider AND ottoman, however, it is only Glider.",3
The First Years  Expandable Mesh Dishwasher Basket,"I am thrilled to have found these neat little dishwasher baskets!  I was searching for something that would allow me to put the straws from my toddler's straw-cups into the dishwasher, and this is ideal for that application!  No more digging for stray straws in the bottom of my dishwasher!  The mesh on the baskets is stretchy enough to hold cup lids and toys, too.  I am so glad to have found these!",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",I have two of these and I love them. The gate extender also works wonders. You can easily mount them and remove them to any desired location. Will recommend to others in need of baby or doggy gate.,5
"Disney Princess High Chair, Princess Silhouette",I bought this high chair for my and I am so glad I did. The Disney Princess design with Cinderella is so cute and I love how soft to the touch the fabric is and that it came with the additional head support since my daughter is so little still but already starting solids. I also like how easy the chair is to maneuver around and how simple it is to adjust. Overall a great product that I highly recommend!,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Waterfall Peek-a-Boo Soother,"We bought this after it was recommended in a few baby books as a great way to help your baby settle and sleep through the night.Well it worked for us with our 6 month old who still has it attached to her crib (she's now just turned 2) She still likes to play it herself when she first goes to bed and we occasionally hear it in the middle of the night if she's woken up. It seems to reassure her and she just goes back off to sleep without needing us to go to her.As a result she's a fantastic sleeper and sleeps from 7pm to 8am every night now, and I'm sure this contributed to her great sleep pattern.This definitely helps her to get off to sleep on her own, and soothes her back to sleep in the middle of the night (once mobile, she learned how to press the button on the front herself and would turn it back on if she woke in the night even as a young baby)She likes the light it gives off I think, as well as the soothing tunes. We've had to replace the batteries many times (4 'c' batteries), but that's a minor pay off for many restful nights. We would highly recommend it as a sleep aid for baby (and parents!)",5
"Boppy Prenatal Cuddle Pillow, Neutral","This pillow does it's job.  It gives me something to put between my knees to keep my hips aligned.  And, now that my belly is big enough at 27 weeks, it gives me some support there.  However, the part that supports your stomach is very thin and short so it doesn't really give that much support.  Also, I've only been using the pillow for a few weeks now and it already feels like it's starting to flatten out.  Honestly, I could have saved myself $35 and just used a regular pillow.  It would have been just as big and supportive.  I wish I had spent the money to get one of the full wrap around maternity pillows.  Even just a good body pillow, which I did end up getting anyway for some back support, is better.  Bottom line, if you're going to spend the money, get the good full support wrap around pillow.  Otherwise, just use regular pillows that you already have.",3
"Green Eats 2 Pack Divided Plates, Orange","I'm trying to eat the modern FDA food guidelines with an eye toward diabetic portions. I have particular problems with portion control (a blob of that, a little more, less of the other&#8230;). So these plates are my training wheels. The big portion is for non-starchy vegetables, one small for carbs, and one for protein. The colors are awful! But everything else costs a ton or has stupid pictures and words on them. I am very pleased with these plates. They help me think clearly about the balance I need to keep. That's a lot of vegetables when you look at it this way. No half a cup of peas drowning in butter. Try a nice salad or steams carrots and cauliflower. Yum.",5
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count","theses were bought for my two daughter who are expecting a few weeks apart. They are good quality and absorbancy. The girls said they were comfy (as liners could be, lol)",4
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White",I have been looking for years for gates for daycare efficient and meet state requirments. This gate is perfect...sturdy...easy to install....adult friendly...older child friendly...reccomend highly!,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,My  baby is fond of the wings of the peacock.And he touches the wings and plays with it often.,5
niceeshop(TM) Rubber Manual Squeezing Suction Milk Breast Pump-Red,"I wanted to give this as a gift but was surprised at the quality of the plastic (pumps). One was broken however, I choose to get a refund instead for the one! No doubt I would order other products of stronger material.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I have to say I really like the Diaper Champ, with one exception-it is definitely NOT always odor free.  I have had to put it in the bathroom now instead of the baby room, because smells from &quot;stinky&quot; diapers will seep out.  I think the best advice is to wrap the really smelly ones in a plastic bag before putting them in. Another word of advice-keep a can of Lysol next to it to spray when you throw a diaper away. It can also be hard to open-I've broken several nails on it.  I've only had it a few weeks (I've been using it for my toddler's diapers until my new baby comes), and I'm hoping that the latch on it loosens up a bit with opening and shutting. Otherwise, it's great that it holds more diapers, and it's SO much easier to put the diapers in it than the Diaper Genie I had.  I don't need two hands for it!",4
Imperial Extra Tall Pressure Mount Safety Gate,"I bought this to keep my 2 cats out of my basement.. I like to keep the door open for wood stove heat circulation purposes. It works great! I've had it a year now and I've had no problems. I will note that the locking mechanism is plastic. I don't use it for my needs - just closing it secures it enough for my purposes. So I'm not sure of the longevity of the lock.. My CATS have never jumped this, and they are very curious about getting into the basement. It fits securely in the doorway and is very easy to open and enter and exit through. A great product that fits my needs.",5
BRICA Baby In-Sight Auto Mirror for in Car Safety,My son loves to look at himself in this mirror and it is easy for me to look back with the rear view and see him. There are multiple ways to secure to the back seat for different vehicles.,5
Summer Infant Spout Protector,"Works like it's supposed to, my monkey boy doesn't scrape himself on the faucet while taking a bath anymore. It holds on tight and looks cute. The only downside might be that you have to take it off every time you want to take a shower if you have the integrated shower switch on top of the faucet (you are unable to get to it otherwise). Other than that little inconvenience, I highly recommend it!",4
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"I do agree with the other reviewers, my son does enjoy his seat, esp the vibration mode..however, the sound is really annoying! The ""bubbles"" sound is so loud that if I am on the phone and it is on in the background people will stop and ask what that noise is! My older kids and husband hate the sound too. I suppose not too bad of an inconvenience if it is entertaining your child. Still, if you are noise sensitive, try it out at Babies R Us first. On a positive note, it is well made. My son is tall and big for his age and the chair seems longer than most, enabling him to stay in it longer. He is now 5 mos and it still fits.",3
American Red Cross Car Child View Mirror,"This is the third mirror that I purchased and tried.  The first one would not work with my mirror and the second was such poor quality that the reflection is useless.  The American Red Cross mirror is very simple to install and the mirror is of sufficient quality that I can see what my little doll is up to in the back seat.  Because it has a ball socket connection, I was even able to turn the mirror vertically to see her whole car seat.  Great product for the price!",5
"Bright Starts Start Your Senses Sensory Plush Pals, Dragonfly",I bought one of the Zebra and one of the giraffe.  My granddaughter and great-granddaughter love them.  I attached them to their tummy-time mats and my granddaughter will fall asleep holding onto her zebra.  It is the first toy she reaches for.,5
Lamaze Octivity Time,"My daughter's daycare had this Octivity Time and they attached it to their bouncer chairs, so the child would have something to manipulate while sitting...My daughter LOVED this toy...You can also attached it to infant carriers/strollers/etc.  There are a numerous activities for the child to play with and the colors and sounds make this engaging for a young infant.  I have just gifted one of these to one of my daughter's caregivers that is pregnant.  High recommend!!!!",5
Munchkin Travel Booster Seat,"It's a diaper bag and booster seat in one. It also has legs with rubber feet so you can easily use it in a booth. It's an incredible product for the price, which I got for under $25. The only downside is having to be careful to not get the buckles mixed up. I accidentally buckled the left belt to the right slot (or vice versa I don't know) and it got stuck. I had to buy a new one. This was after having it for several months with the normal amount of wear and tear so I wasn't that upset.",4
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","This was exactly what I expected when I ordered it.  A simple, rubber cover to prevent bumps and bruises from the bathtub faucet.  It took maybe 10 seconds to fit to the spout.  The fins on the side pull tight to varying sized faucets.  Seems like sturdy rubber.",4
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce","I have this in pink and blue for my son and daughter.  I've had SEVERAL types of sippy cups and bottles over the years!  I consider myself somewhat of an expert by now lol...Ok so the issue I have with these straw bottles is that sometimes they leak.  Also I thought the whole point of buying a stainless steel bottle for your kid is to AVOID PLASTIC, but then they have a plastic straw right in them, and unless you are very good about washing them IMMEDIATELY bacteria and odors can accumulate inside the plastic straw parts.  And not everyone realizes the piece that the straw goes into, ALSO needs to come apart into 2 pieces for washing!!  I didn't realize that at first with my son's and it got nasty! :(  I had to order replacement parts from Thermos as I was too grossed out and even after good cleaning the smell wouldn't go away.  It can be hard to tell those are 2 pieces and not 1, unless you look very closely.  That may have just been on the blue model actually, which is slightly larger, but they also make the pink one in that slightly larger size and I imagine it is the same on the inside.  But with both models of the Thermos steel straw bottles, I think it's a pain to clean all the little pieces.I also tried a Klean Kanteen 12oz. sippy but since it wasn't insulated, it was very cold for my daughter to hold and it sweat and lost temp quickly.  I found that the Foogo also did not insulate as well as I hoped.  So I bought a Hydro Flask and tried the Klean Kanteen sippy adaptor on it and it worked!!  It does NOT leak, the temp holds well and it doesn't sweat... I'm a happy mom now!!",4
"Frenchie Mini Couture Tuxedo Bib with 3D Applique, Black",It's more of an instant-halloween costume than anything. Since the design is appliqued on it won't fade or come on in a wash like similar products that have painted-on designs. I recommend this product whole-heartedly.,5
Learning Curve Baby's First Links,I wish I had read the reviews for this and realized that the product has false advertising -- I received the same set of flower / star shaped CHEAP links.  Do not order this product!!!,1
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce",This thermos is well constructed and leak proof. Just what I need for 7 year old triplets. I recommend for all children who have trouble taking care of fragile things.,5
Disney Pirates of the Caribbean On Stranger Tides Pillowcase,My Granddaughter loves any johnny depp items.  This was a big hit at her birthday party! I will be getting more.,5
"Swing Baby Toddler S-26R Full Bucket Seat Swing (no Rope or Chain), BLUE",Great swing. This is just as durable as the ones at the park. My grandchildren love it!! Good value for the money.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,This Jumperoo was a favorite of both my children! It is a nice size and not too heavy but very sturdy. I only wish my children could use it longer!,5
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,"I have to keep my two year old away from her TV and toys stored in her armoire. I was using bungee cords to hold the doorknobs together, but this is so much better. I like that the latches can be removed entirely, and that they can also swivel out of the way. They aren't exactly easy to remove and replace, but if they were too easy to use, they wouldn't be a deterrent to my daughter. As other uses for these arise, I can totally imagine buying more of them. They are great!",5
Elephants Snooze Sack,"I love this sleep sack. I love the comfy strap around the middle. It serves two purposes. One to keep sack in place about and not ride up around face. Two, it keeps belly warm. What I don't like. The size medium is nothing like halos medium. More like a halos small. So baby will. Grow out of this too quick",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We love this seat. It is our baby's favorite place to be put down. He'll play with the toy bar, watch the lights and rainforest friends until he falls asleep. The 4 D batteries last a long time, but I still would recommend getting some good quality rechargeables for it.",5
"Racerback Relaxed Hands Free Pumping and Nursing Bra - White, Large",Great for pumping not so great for nursing. If you use it for nursing then you can't keep you boobs in it,3
"Britax Head and Body Support Pillow, Iron/Gray","Haven't used the product yet, still waiting for the passenger.  However, I did wash it and it held up well.  I hung it out to dry.  Being a first time mom, I'm still not quite sure how to place this in the car seat, I'm hoping the nurses at the hospital can show me when the time comes.  The package didn't have instructions that I saw, just a picture of a super cute smiling baby.  I haven't read the Britax car seat and stroller manual either, but I'm sure we'll figure it out. LOL",5
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner, Orange","It cleans the bottles fine, but the bottom twists off if you turn it counterclockwise, so you always have to turn the handle clockwise. Also when i take the brush out of the bottle, I get a spray of soap no matter how slow I take it out.  I got it because I needed a brush with a handle i can on a hook and with no sponges on the tip.  I'm going back to Nuby.",2
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","This seat fits great in my 2008 Toyota Highlander Hybrid.  I have also installed it in a Nissan Versa.  I love the high weight harness.  My 5-year-old son will probably out grow it by height before weight.  There is a spot to store the manual, but you can't get to it with the seat installed.  It makes it kind of useless if you are referring to the manual during installation.",5

"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet",Its a good product. Our baby is enjoying it.The projector works fine and music has 2 volume modes - and speaker is pretty good.No issues so far with the product - the projector is a good distraction for kids.We also don't use the projector all the time - sometimes we just put in on music and moving mobile mode.,5
Smart Mom Teething Bling Bangle,"Well, I don't know who came up with this idea, but I wish I had! It is beautiful enough for me to wear, if my daughter will let me. She plays with it constantly. I am going to have to buy the necklace that goes with it. Very pleased with the whole process.",5
Dragons Wooden Ceiling Mobile,I love this mobile.  I was looking for something that was different and would add a whimsical feel to the nursery.  I didn't want a nursery where everything matches and looks like it is from a catalogue.  This mobile is perfect.  It is great for a boy or girl.  It is supder easy to put together and beautiful.  I would highly recommend it if you are looking for something unique.,5
"Anna Claire Beautiful Designed Baby Receiving Blanket, Double Sided Designs, Swaddle Blankets (Under The Sea)",I chose that rating because of the details.My daughter and son-in-law chose this for their baby. She plans to make the nursey with flowers and butterflys. You got the order out in good time.,4
Graco Travel Lite Table Chair Tango in the Tongo,"We have multiple versions of this same chair and all we can say is ""It Rocks!"".  While it looks a little ""old school"" and there are cooler looking versions out there, there are some huge selling points to this chair.  One, it clips on quickly and is sturdy (no bounce).  Two, it can be completely wiped down after each use (no cloth which is huge when kids are messy eaters).  Three, the clip on tray.  Who really wants their kid eating food directly off the table in a restaurant?  And, the tray can go in the dishwasher, even better for clean up.  Buy this chair!",5
Baby Playpen Kids 8 Panel Safety Play Center Yard Home Indoor Outdoor Pen Playard,"I was a little hesitant when deciding to purchase this playpen because it wasn't a name brand playpen, but I'm  glad I went with this one. The product came on time and the panels were packaged well. It took me about 15 minutes to unpack and build the play pen.(I left the stickers off just in case they might peel off.) The play center is sturdy enough (on carpet) for my 3 year old boy who loves to climb over it and the toys are perfect for my 13 mth old. I haven't tried it outside or on hardwood floors yet. As  soon as I completed building the play pen, my 13 mth old who crawls everywhere decided to walk while in it. I was floored!!! It  must have boosted her confidence knowing the rails weren't too far away just in case she got tired. The only reason I gave this playpen 4 stars instead of 5 is because the instruction manual was confusing. So I built it by just looking at it, and by all means, it was easy to figure out. You really don't need the instruction manual, but for those who like to read manuals like me, it was a waste of 5 minutes.",4
"Thermos Ice Mat, 9 Cube","I suppose you get what you pay for. Theses are only a couple of dollars each but honestly, they're not worth that. I bought 4 less than a week ago and already two have leaked more than one square. One of those leaked the first day I used it. I use them in my baby's bottle carrier to keep the milk cold on the way to daycare. If I have to replace one a week, that's too expensive for me. So...my opinion, the material they use to hold the water in the mat is too thin and likely to puncture too easily. Boo.",2
My Hikes--Adjust kids pant legs! (Butterfly),I bought these for my daughters jogging pants that are too long for when she is crawling around the house and trying to stand up.  They do the job and are cute but I do not feel they are worth the $12 price.  Honestly they seem to be a $5 if that item.  The plastic does not seem really sturdy so I am careful not to bend too far for the fear of them breaking.  If they were cheaper I would probably order more but at $12 a pop - no way.  I gave four stars for the fact they do what they are made to do and are cute but would give one star for price.,4
Pink Girl Mini Rubber Ducky - 24 Count,"Cute for baby shower, but are much smaller than advertised, but still super cute! We are using these for my baby shower as my favors! Will be a huge hit I am sure!",5
Baby Emporio - 6-12 Months - ALL BOY Tights - Anti-Slip,"Great product. Must have for winter. Fits great under my baby boy's pants and looks great as it seems like he has shoes, yet at the same time, I don't have to worry about his socks falling off!",5

"Claessens' Kids Kid'Sleep Moon Nightlight, White/Blue","Like other reviewers have said, it does take careful reading of the instructions, consistency, and double checking the settings on a regular basis.  Once you get in a routine, it is WONDERFUL!!!!!  Our 3 year old daughter won't come out of her room until the bunny wakes up at 7:30am, or if she doesn't nap, she still knows she has to play quietly in her room until the set time.  Make sure you don't let the little ones try to set it or play with it, they can accidentally turn the audible alarm on or switch it to weekend mode.  There are a lot of settings and options, but that's great if you're patient!  It has 12hour and 24 hour time settings, so 7:30pm and 19:30 as an example.  It can be set for a weekday wake up time, a weekend wake up time, and nap time.  It just quietly switches from the sleeping bunny picture to the awake bunny picture.  You can set it to actually make an alarm noise, tweeting birds as an example, for older kids that may need to get up for school.  It was bright at first as our daughter slept in a completely dark room, but she adjusted to it after about a week.",5
Ecopiggy Orthodontic Natural Pacifier (1pk) (0-6m),"My baby likes this pacifier, but then again he is not picky and likes mostly any pacifier. I wish this pacifier came with a lid, something to protect the nipple when the baby is not using it. I've noticed that fabfic partials tend to stick more on this item, maybe because its sticky rubbber? Not sure, but I wish it had a cap like some of the NUK pacifiers have. Other than that , I like it.Don't forget to put the pacifier in boiling water before use..",4
Medium - Imse Vimse Training Pants (28-37 lbs),"These training pants are great but a bulky.  They will absorb any normal accident.  However be prepared to to have a spare set of clothes for the heavy accidents.  I would recommend you wash and them inside out.  The one down fall, no snaps.  If your child goes poop you'll have too pull the training pants down the legs to get them off, meaning you may have poop smudges down the legs.  Because of this I'm rating these a four star.  Eventually I did find training pants with snaps on the side (Tinkle Time  Trainers)  It made potty training more enjoyable and less messy.",4
"Kids Line My First ABC 6 Piece Crib Set, Multicolor","This bedding is very versatile for a boy or a girl. There are lots of sheets to match it. I made some brown curtains to go along with the valance. The quilt is very cute too. I also purchased the rug, lamp and 3 animal pictures that go with it.",5
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Diaper Cover with Hook and Loop, Aqua, Size 1",These Thirsties make the concept and process of using cloth diapers a real deal.  Basically you are getting the leak proofing (elastic) you would get from disposable diapers with the convenience and re-usability of a cloth diaper.  Pattern is unisex so this works for both genders (if you're conscious about that).  It's the type of product that sells it self - meaning once you show other moms and dads they can really the value ($$$).,5

"OsoCozy Factory Seconds Prefold diapers, Infant 4x8x4, Bleached","I just received these diapers today, and they were in very good condition. I also don't see why they are factory seconds. All the stitching is great. I have not put these on my little one yet,as I am still pre-washing them. I have already washed them twice, and they are drying on the line for the second time. They have not shrunk much, as I don't own a dryer, and I am still waiting for them to quilt as nicely as I would like(though they are quilting). I'm assuming another two washes will get them the way I would like. And I'm sure they would quilt up faster in a dryer. These are long and thick, so I think they will be a bit bulky. But, as my boy has a tendency to pee like a fire hose, I'm actually looking forward to a bulkier diaper - maybe he won't hose these down in one hour! Can't wait to try them out.",4
"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors May Vary","Does the job well, no leaks and the funnel shape on the lid helps to get the powder in the bottle easily.",5
"The First Years 1 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce",Love these bottles. Used with both my children. I end up using the wide neck nipples though. My favorite bottle.,5
Diono Radian Angle Adjuster,"As much as I love (see other review) the Diono Radian RTX, I really feel that this piece should have come with it.  When you pay $300 for a car seat, you really shouldn't have to buy any accessories.",4
"Evenflo 6 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 8-Ounce","These are great. I started using the Lifefactory WeeGo bottles, which I really like, but I was freezing milk in bottles and once I realized how many bottles I would really need, the price of the Lifefactory bottles, plus their caps made the prospect rather daunting.I have been freezing in these bottles for about two months. I had one bottle burst, but that was my fault for filling it too full. And other than my horror at having lost that milk and the bottle, no harm was done. The bottle was still frozen, so there was no mess to clean up in the freezer. I simply removed it.The bottles come in a really thick box with six compartments. Each compartment has the bottle with its shelf packaging. While I don't need the shelf packaging, I really liked that the divided box, because I hope to have more than one child and can see putting the bottles away in these boxes in between children to keep them from breaking.I still prefer the look of the WeeGo bottles, but the price is right on these bottles and although they don't have the silicon sleeve, they are pretty heavy duty and I haven't had any trouble with breakage from normal wear and tear.",5
Safety 1st On-the-Go Fold-Up Booster Seat,"We started using this booster seat when our daughter turned one.  Mostly we use it for family functions outside our home where there are no highchairs.  It allows me to be able to eat with the rest of my family without having to hold Brooke on my lap or feed her first.  She sits securely in her seat right at the table with us and can feed herself.I love how compact it is - especially when there is so much stuff to lug when travelling with a baby.  In fact, I just keep it in the back of my SUV.  It is easy to clean - I have put the whole thing right in my dishwasher.The only thing I feel that could be improved are the retractable straps.  It is difficult to tighten the straps which secure the booster onto a kitchen chair - a bit stressful when you have a hungry toddler anxious to eat.But, for the money I feel this seat overall is a good buy.  Would definitely recommend to others.",4
"Trend Lab Jersey Message Bibs (Set of 3), Photo with Baby/Blue","This is really nice. I will buy this for other gifts. The bibs were just what I was looking for, Nice.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,The Sophie Giraffe has been a favorite of my son since he was 2 1/2 months old and could hold it for short periods of time. He is now 8 months and still loves it. He uses it to chew on when he is teething and uses it to play with when he is not.  It was a great investment.,5
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom",We use this everyday and almost all day long. Since I have 2 kids and I am nursing one. I can talk to my son in his playroom while I am nursing. This way if he is getting ready to do something he is not supposed to be doing I can tell him to stop. This is great since latching on for nursing is a little difficult.,5
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda  Atmosferra Stroller, Nero","I wanted a stroller that was very stylish, but not over priced...and that is exactly what I got. It has some weight to it which I like, and we always catch people staring at it!!!",5

"The Safe Sippy 2 2-in-1 Sippy to Straw Bottle, Pink","I got this sippy cup because of its stainless steel interior but it was a bit heavy for my then 1year-old son.  He could carry it, but it was hefty.  It also can damage wood floors when dropped or thrown... it is quite heavy when you put liquids in it.  Additionally, it is not easy to remove the outer shell for cleaning.  I know you don't have to, but over time, there has been trapped liquid and food matter that needed removing. Lastly, the lining inside developed some kind of black mold that I couldn't get out.  So I have tossed it.",2
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx","I really liked the carseat itsself, but had a difficult time getting one of the straps to tighten once in the car. This made me very nervous, so I decided to return and go with a different brand.",2
JJ Cole System Bag - Cocoa/Clover,"Loved the style and compartments of this bag, but it hasn't lasted long. My Similac free bag has held up better than this. The zipper is completely shot. I definitely expected more quality for the price.",2
"Graco Trekko Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis","I am giving 3 stars instead of 5 due to the fact that this stroller is quite big, bulky, and heavy, even when folded up. I am a petite woman, and I can barely lift it. The wheels are also bigger than I anticipated.Having said that, though, otherwise it seems to be very good quality. The fabric and materials are all quite nice. It looks like it will be comfortable for Baby, and still easy to clean up. Our Graco Snugride pumpkin seat snaps in easily. The 3-wheel design makes it easy to maneuver, in spite of its large size. Also, I suspect the large rubber wheels will do very well on long outdoor walks or trails. I like that the handle adjusts up & down depending on your height. Also a good amount of storage space underneath.Overall, I would recommend it. We were deciding between this and the Baby Jogger City Mini or City Micro. We chose this one, due to the fact that it was a fraction of the cost. However, it is nowhere near as compact or light as the Baby Jogger designs. Just be aware of this before you buy, so you're not surprised.",3
The First Years Babypro All In One Baby Food Maker,It was a lot smaller than I expected. It would be nice for someone that is just going to steam down more whatever they are having for dinner themselves....but for somebody that makes large batches of baby food at a time I would just stick with a good steamer pot and processor.,5
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss 4 Count Spill-Proof Trainer Sippy Cups with Removable Handles, 7 Ounce",i've used take and toss cups for several years.  well for child number 3 i found these.  the handles actually hold the lids on so when the kid takes and tosses the cup off the high chair the lid doesn't fly off as it does without the handles.  they are a bit of a hassle to get on but totally worth it.,4
"Skip Hop Reversible Plush Blanket, Alphabet Zoo",I love this. It's very soft and looks to be well made. You won't be sorry. Just buy it now.,5
"Summer Infant Bibbity, Pink","I have used these bibs for years for my toddlers when they start to self-feed.  They really do catch a lot of the food, if not all.  The bib stays on and in place.  And they're easy to clean.  Sometimes I put them in the top rack of the dishwasher.  Other times I have put them in the washing machine.  Mostly I just wipe clean and hang to dry.",5
Bright Starts Lots of Links- Solid Colors,The rings come undone quickly without much effort. That makes it difficult to hang things from these but they meet my needs.,3
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman",It was easy to put together. My 13 year old son did it for me. It has been really nice to have with us in the living room. The changer is nice so you don't have to place him in the crib and bend over as far. The price was nice too. $20 cheaper than the same ones in store.,5
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 4 Pack Bunch-A-Bowls with Lids, Colors May Vary","I tried putting these bowls in our microwave at 20 percent power for 10 seconds, and they started to spark and food (strawberries and green beans) had burn marks on them. The bowls are a good size, the lids snap on well, and they do fine in our dishwasher, but you may not be able to use them in the microwave - and they are clearly advertised as microwave-safe.",2

UPPAbaby Vista Cup Holder,"I agree with most others on here, Love the stroller, and have no complaints on the other items we have bought. The cup holder is just not worth the money.  It does not stay on when the stroller is folder up. The chain breaks easily.",2
Bamboobies Boob-ease Therapy Pillows + Pair Bamboobies - 2 ct,"These are THE BEST for sore, engorged nursing boobies!  I've tried so many different ways of soothing the pain during the first couple months of nursing and nothing compairs to these therapy pillows! I loved them ""cold"" for easing the pain of engorgement! When I felt like I needed to open milk ducts that were not fully emptying during nursing I would warm these up and stick them in my bra. What a relief! I get these for every new nursing mommy friend I have!  I feel like it makes those first couple months of nursing a lot more comfortable!  It's a total ""pamper me"" product for nursing mommies!  Worth the money!  Buy them!  You won't regret it!!!",5
"Baby Trend Sit N Stand Ultra Tandem Stroller, Phantom","Updating:  1 minor set back to be aware: the stroller can tip backward when you have the baby or baby carrier on the back and the front passenger gets out of the front sit or you park the stroller up hill. Don't have too many bags on the back either. What I did to counter bakLance the wt is having your bag or something heavy in the cargo basket I also tried using the gym wristband or ankle band weight and wrapped it around the center if the stroller and take it off before folding. Works like a charm.Originally I got the Joovy Ultralight b/c it said 21lbs so I thought it was light. OMG it's 28.2 lbs (both mfr and my scale) and you can't place the baby carrier on the back (tandem) if your toddler wants to sit in the front instead of standing up. So I returned it.  I did some more research and decided to get Baby Trend ultra sit and stand.  I couldn't wait for shipping so I got one at Target for same price and 5% off for using their red card.I have a nearly 3 yo and an infant. My daughter flip flopping where she wants to sit (front or stand up in the back). With Joovy i couldnt put my new born on the back. Thanks god for Baby Trend that we have an option to put the baby in the front or back and the infant car seat clip onto the tray and have buckles and bar on the back to hold onto the infant carrier. I have a graco snugride 35 and it fits perfectly.  I decided to go with this Baby Trend due to the age of my kids age different. When my new born turns 1.5 or 2 to use the front seat then my toddler would be 5 who would listen better (pray to god she would).  If you have 2 kids close to age and young then you should need double stroller not tandem so they can rest.This is heavy 26 lbs but lighter than joovy (28.2lbs).  It folds up nicer than Joovy and very very sturdy made.  It took me 5 min to put take out of box and put wheels together.  That's all to it.  Overall it's better than Joovy UltraLIght and cheaper (139.99)  However I suggested before you would order from any where, go to the Target they have this new version than babiesrus and check it out by bring your kids to try out.Item steers smoothplenty of roomitem wt is averageSturdy made productlove the cups holderlove the tray that baby carrier can clips onto the trayeasy to fold/unfoldFit well in the trunk of my VW jetta (2014 where trunk is smaller than previous models)Price cheaper than other brandsEasy to assemble (5 min for me)Warning:  If you have 2 younger kids with age close to each other then better off with double stroller so they can rest.

"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I highly recommend this tub.  I have used it placed within our bathtub--I sit low to the baby and do not strain my back.  The sling was excellent to use when our son was a newborn--made bathing him a delight.  He is now 6 mos. old and sitting up--the infant side helps him to sit up without falling forward (like babies first learning to sit up tend to do), since it provides an upward slant under his legs.  As soon as he sits better, I'll move him to other side, which has the back support.  At first, I thought as a little boy, sitting on the infant side was uncomfortable (looked that way to me!) but he  loves bathtime so he must be ok.  I do not fill the tub up too much so as to make him float--and he's just fine with that--he's too busy trying to use his hands and pick up his rubber ducky.",4
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I bought this pillow for my wife in the first trimester.  She absolutely loves this pillow.  She cannot say enough good things about it.

Gund Baby 24&quot; Comfycozy Pippy Monkey Blanket,"This review is for the lamb blanket.  I see from the other reviews on here that the monkey may not hold up well.  My almost 4-year-old son has had his lamb since he was a baby and loves it!  The texture of the fur on top is so soft that he likes to make a 'lamby pillow' at night by spreading the blanket on top of his pillow.  The lamby is a nice cross between a stuffed animal and a blanket (though is a little too small to use as an actual blanket).  It's a bit big to take places, but is a wonderful bed companion.  I've put ours through the washing and drying machines multiple times without issue.  Great gift to give or receive!",5
"Oeuf Mask and Tail Set, Zebra","My 2 year old loves dress up and adores the tigers at our local zoo, so he has had the best time with the tiger tail and nose set.

"Trend Lab Flannel Crib Sheet, Swirl Print","We wanted these for my 2 year old daughter who is infatuated with everything monkey. She had regular sheets with monkeys on them, but I had not found flannel sheets with monkeys on them.  As the weather got colder and I put the flannel sheets onto her bed (crib turned toddler bed) she got very upset and tried to take them off because I didn't have monkey flannels to put on.  When we got home from my grandparents house after my grandmother got her these sheets, and I went to put these onto her bed, I had to take off her regular monkey sheets.  My daughter was upset until she noticed that I was putting different monkey sheets on.  Her excitement was beyond explanation.I love the extra elastic bands to help secure the sheets to the bed.  In addition to the ""normal"" elastic in the edge of the sheets there is a thicker piece of elastic that goes diagonally across each corner that prevents the sheets from popping off the corners.  Not that my daughter has tried to take these sheets off her bed yet, she won't be able to if she tries.",5

"ERGObaby Organic Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Blush Beige",even if you don't use the ergo carrier this was really helpful as a barrier when putting the baby to sleep.  we put him in it while he was dozing off so that when it came time to put him in the crib he didn't feel much fingering on his skin or through his clothing so he didn't wake up from the transition.  we also used in it our moby and just as a warming layer at chilly times.,5
Aden + Anais Bamboo Crib Sheet - Azure Leafy - Aqua,"I'm a huge fan of Aden and Anais in general ... and had actually purchased their organic cotton crib sheets.  The bamboo crib sheet is that much softer, it's just wonderful. The pattern is the scratchiest part of the sheet - it's beautiful though. I'm going to buy a plain bamboo sheet.  We have washed this at least 10x by now (every other day) and it's standing up, no problems with seams or falling apart.",5
Go Anywhere Table and Footrest,"I bought 2 trays for my 7 and 4 y/o for a 10 day car trip. The trays are very handy and easy to clean, and the foot rest was great for the 7 y/o (4 y/o didn't even come close, we taped a shoe box to it to add height). Because of the negative reviews I told my boys over and over, BE CAREFUL!! with the trays. Well, by day 5 the 4 y/o kicked it hard enough to break it away from the base. He was able to kick it because it was pushed away from his seat while not in active use. When the tray isn't in active use, it rests in front of the seat. If you have a kicker, you'll need to stress they can't. I'd say my 4 y/o is on the ""normal"" side of the active spectrum, but he IS a 4 y/o, and if you look at the picture, it would appear that is the audience One Step Ahead is producing this for. I'm planning to try to fix it w/ my hot glue gun since it was glued in the first place, but I don't know how that'll work.Shoddy, cheap materials and workmanship, plain and simple.So, in short, the reviews are correct. This is a handy item that is great for long car trips--we spent a total of 44 hrs in the car--but buy it with the understanding that you may only get one car trip out of it. For my 4 y/o, it was half a trip. I'm giving it 3 stars rather than the 2 the quality deserves because it's a great item in theory, better than the others trays I see online.",3
Graco Mealtime Highchair Seth,"What a great highchair.  I use this daily to feed my son and I really like it!  I love the 5 point harness especially since my ds thinks he can climb out of the chair and walk on air lol. I also like the ease of cleaning the cover.  Wipe it down and put it back on, breezy!This isn't a small chair, but it folds rather compactly and can be moved with relative ease, just be sure to take the brakes off first!",4
"Blueberry Basix All in One Pocket Diaper, Medium, Cow","I ordered this Diaper in the US because it wasn't available here in Europe. It was out of order. I already have all different kinds of cloth diapers. Charlie Banana, Blueberry/Swaddlebee, TotsBots, BabyVivo, Babyland, ... My favorites are Charlie Banana and TotsBots - both dry very fast, without any dryer, within 3-4 hours. Blueberry needs longer, but they are good too. They have really nice illustrations and fit perfectly. Not so good is the very thick filling, which you can't remove.",5
"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer","Worked great when it worked, but stopped working after just a couple months. Just keeps giving error with every bath.",2
"Britax Car Seat Travel Cart, Black",This is a great product for traveling with small children.  It fits well with my seat.  You really need to make sure that you pull the straps very tight.  I get many compliments on this at the airport.,4
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow",This is a great toy and my son loves kicking the piano and making music. He has fun looking at himself in the mirror and playing with all the toys. It's great that I can flip the arch down for tummy time since my son has just learned how to roll over and wants to be on his tummy a lot. However my son wants to put everything in his mouth since he is teething and the toys are hard and not made to be put in his mouth. Since there are loops that the toys attach to it was easy for me to take one off and put a teether toy I had from another mat on. Luckily the teether toy I had already had the capabilities to attach to the loops. This is why I gave the review 4 stars instead of 5. Still I am very pleased and my son plays on it every day. I love that he can use this through his toddler years so it's being used for a while and not just a few months.,4
"Bumbo Seat Play Tray, Ivory","I got this tray for my baby's bumbo so we could attempt to let her play with food. She's not quite ready for a high chair, but she does sit quite well in her bumbo. It's easy to get on, but a little harder to get off. Not too much to say other than its a great bumbo accessory!",5
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"Great for beach, outdoor festivals, park etc. wAterproof and easily to fold back into carrying case. Wish the outside pocket had a snap or Velcro to actually be functional.",5
my best friend Inflatable breast feeding pillow,"I used the Brest Friend two years ago when my daughter was born, at the recommendation of a lactation consultant.  I loved it!  It worked wonderfully--much better than the Boppy.  I'm quite petite, so I particularly liked that the Brest Friend was so adjustable and could fit close to my body (my newborn would slip into the space between my body and the Boppy), and that there are bumps on the pillow that hold a newborn's head up to just the right spot.  I used it until she was several months old and wished I'd had it in the hospital when I was first trying to figure out how to nurse.  A great product!Now I'm due to have my second child, so went to wash the cover of My Brest Friend.  The zipper broke, although I'd only washed it a few times.  I called Zenoff, using the number on their web site, explained the problem, and asked where I could find a replacement cover.  Not only did they volunteer to send me a new cover free of charge, but they walked me through a description of the different covers so I could choose which one to get, and shipped out my choice immediately.  I recieved the replacement cover in 3 days.  Couldn't be better!",5
"The Mommy Hook, Black with Black Pad",This hook was supposed to be amazing. I used it once however and the foam started falling off! I am returning it. I have friends who love this thing and I was excited about the idea of it. Major fail.,1
"Red, White and Blue Vintage Aviator Airplane Plane Baby Boy Bedding 11 pc Crib Set by Sweet Jojo Designs",this bedding is adorable. quality and colors are great. the suade trim is a nice touch. this does not come with the crib bumpers which is fine with me since I will not be using them anyway.,5
Peter Potty Toddler Urinal,"Adjustable height.  It ""flushes""! The only drawback is that the collection tray is difficult to remove. It sticks or catches somewhere (and I can't figure out where) so when you pull hard enough to remove it, the water and pee sloshes resulting in spillage (yuck!) Except for that, I love it. My toddler loves it and it is small enough and light enough that you could take it with you for an extended trip.  It's not made for travel, but if you were driving to grandma's for the weekend, it would be easy to take along.  It does mount to the wall if you prefer.  The stand works just fine for us.",4
"Summer Infant Cradler, Ivory","Love this item.  Keeps my baby's head from getting jerked from side to side, and neck stays straight while he naps.  Also, nice cool materials keep baby from overheating (even while traveling to Arizona!), unlike a lot of U-shaped support pillows.  Fully adjustable, grows with baby.  Stays in place.  Never again will I have to deal with rolled up blankets to support baby's head and neck.  This is much more convenient, works better, and is much safer.  Every baby needs one.",5
Today's Mom Cozy Cuddler Pregnancy Pillow - White,"This is not a toy, but so far the pillow is amazing. I have had it for almost two months and I love it. I have issues with using mulitpule pillows when I sleep, they always tend to fall whenever I toss and turn. My husband bought me this pillow as a gift after he got tired of me using him to rest my legs on at night. I did have a small issue with the top of the pillow bing too full. I am 5'8"" and I have no issue with the pillow being too tight around my body. The pillow works with me on nights when it takes me a while to fall asleep. After I am out though, I only find myself waking up to go to the bathroom, something that is unavoidable during pregnancey. I sleep more soundly than before with the pressure taken off my back. I would highly recommend this product to everyone pregnant or not.",4

"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","I have tried just about every baby bottle! I avoided Born Free because of the cost and the additional parts (the valve system)I should have just gone to them from the beginning. These are the only bottles that don't leak- in 5 months of use I haven't had a single leak- not like Avent, where I was constantly covered in formula!You can save some money on the nipples- Dr. Brown wide bottles are the same nipple.",5
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","My wife kept wanting a BOB and mentioning it to me again and again.  We had initially settled for a cheaper stroller, and then we were hoping to find a bargain on one of these on clist or get lucky on a garage sale, but we never found any secondhand.  Now I know why!  I don't think you'd ever part with this.",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","This is an incredible buy. The price on Amazon is lower than anywhere else I've looked around.The seat is comfy and easy to secure. Like some of the reviews here, I didn't think threading it was that big of a deal. The selling part for us was the high safety rating this carseat got.We got this in the matrix fabric, which is not the plushiest of them all, so if that's a concern, get a more expensive color with the plushy seats. To us this one is comfortable and does the job well.",5
Boon Squirt Baby Food Dispensing Spoon in Pink,"Love the spoon, super handy.  My baby loves it too.  My only compliant is that the spoon is too deep where my baby can't get all of the food out of the bottom of the spoon on her own.  I have to slide the spoon on her lip to get all of the food off.  Would buy it again.",4
"SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket, Brown Mod Circles, Pastel Pink","Finally, a swaddling blanket that's modern, large, and well made. I highly recommend it! I have 2 for my son and have bought several as gifts. Everyone seems to love it.",5

Yookidoo Stack 'N' Spray Tub Fountain,"I bought this for my one-year old daughter after reading most of the reviews already posted.  Since most of the negative reviews were written a while ago, I was hoping that the problems others experienced were fixed.  Unfortunately, this was not so.  After three uses, the pump died.  My husband (who is an electrical engineer) could not fix it so we trashed the base.  Granted, she can still play with the boats, but they do tend to tip over and sink to the bottom of the tub.  It is a shame, my daughter loved it for the brief time it was working.",1
mybaby HoMedics SoundSpa On-The-Go,"I purchased this for a trip we were taking with our 6 month old to avoid packing the sleep sheep we were given when he was born, and I must say, I was impressed. True it doesn't get quite as loud as the sleep sheep but the volume seems very adequate to me. I like how it can either be on a timer or can run continuoulsy until you turn it off (this continuous opperation is not an option on the sleep sheep -its timer only goes up to 45 mins). It uses 3 AAA batteris and those will last about a week running continuously at night about 8-10 hrs. It's compact and easy to use for travel. I could also easly be clipped onto a car seat for use in the car as well. We primarily use the ""ocean"" feature and it sounds ok. My husband can hear the track repeating but I have to listen pretty carefully to catch it. Overall an excellent purchase for the money.",4
Sesame Street Framed Friends Green Folding Travel Potty Seat,"We bought this seat because my son potty trained at 13 months.  He was too small not to fall into toilets at that age, and it was just too difficult for me to somehow hold him AND him be comfortable going AND then be able to wipe him if necessary.  At home we have a padded toilet insert that he loves, and our other toilet has a flip-down kids seat that's fantastic.This fold-up seat is small and easy to take with us everywhere.  He calls it ""my special seat"" and will use any toilet, anywhere.  This even included a scary black toilet we saw once that he didn't want to get near, until I put his special seat on top.  He used the toilet.  When he was washing his hands, a 3-yr-old boy and his mother came into the restroom... and I overheard the boy outright refuse to use the toilet because it was scary.  They ended up leaving the bathroom with the mom reminding him not to pee in his underwear.Anyhow, my son is now 2.5 years old.  We still use this seat when we're out.  He's never once fallen or slipped.  He feels very secure on this seat.  There was a little bit of a trick to getting used to it back when we first got it - I set the seat at the very FRONT of the toilet, then push it back until the front lip of this travel seat lines up with the front lip of the toilet seat.  Then I left him up onto it.The only down side is that it's not as stable as our home seats, and now that he's older he can go without our help at home, but he still needs us to lift him up and put him on the toilet when we travel.I think they should install a child's urinal in every womens room for when boys are with their moms.  Public toilets are too tall for him to pee standing, so we're stuck using this travel seat until his legs get longer.  When he's with my husband, he can go in the urinals so they don't have to lug this silly seat everywhere.  Now that he's older and larger on the seat, we have to be diligent with ""point it down"" so that he doesn't pee on the front rim of the toilet or on the floor or his pants while sitting.  I doubt that would be an issue with a girl, though, and the seat works perfect when he needs to poop.  It's even plenty stable when he leans forward to wipe.",5
"Gerber Graduate BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips Spill Proof Cup, 7 Ounce, Colors May Vary","These don't leak, are easy to clean, and the perfect size for meals.  I had the bigger gerber sippies but my Dr thinks my kids are drinking too much and gaining weight.  perfect portion control.",5
Koala Baby 4 Pack Receiving Blankets - Boy Assortment,"I bought these receiving blankets when my son was first born back in November. I used them to swaddle him for almost a month.  These blankets are very good size.  After the first month, I cannot swaddle him anymore because he's an ""escape artist"" who always manage to get one of his arm or leg out side of the blankets. The blankets held up well after washes.  Now the weather are getting warmer.  I'm using them as light blankets for warm nights.  They are excellent.  Definitely worth the money.",5
"Lorex BB2411 2.4&quot; Sweet Peek Video Baby Monitor with IR Night Vision and Zoom, White","This is my first and only video baby monitor.The good:Excellent live color video qualityOutstanding night vision capabilityAudio-only mode (saves battery)Auto-shutoff during inactivity (saves battery)Auto-on when it detects sound and/or motionInternal batteries so you can take the monitor with you via included belt-clipBattery can last a day without charging (depending on use/activity in room)Intercom function allows you to talk to your childMusical lullabies play through the camera, activated by the parent via a button on the monitor, to help the child fall asleep (5 different tunes to choose from)Night-light built into the camera to provide a soft illumination in your child's roomThe bad:Poor mounting design on camera.  Not easy to mount onto wall due to its inability to bend at a 90 degree angle.  Seems like ceiling mounting is best option (but then video is upside-down).The monitor itself is thin, and doesn't stand on its own very well.  It's constantly falling over at the slightest of movement.  The best way to store it on a table is screen-side down, but then you can't see the video!The musical lullabies stay on until you turn them off.  It would be nice to have a 5-min or 10-min timer on the lullabies.Short range - only about 100 ft line of sight.  If you have walls, expect to reduce that range by about 20 ft per wall.  We have our kid on the 2nd floor of our house and we can't get a signal from our basement, about 30 ft directly below her room.The ugly:When the lullabies are playing, it's the only thing that you can hear through the monitor.  Therefore, the screen would always be on and the sound-sensors constantly going off.  This causes the battery on the monitor to fun out much quicker (about 2 hrs).This also causes another problem - if you use the lullaby to help your child go to sleep, all you can hear is the lullaby - you can't hear little grunts, groans, or anything other than a full-out cry (and even then it's hard to hear) because the lullabies are so loud coming out of the monitor.  This is because the mic on the camera is only about 1 inch from the speaker.I would recommend not even introducing the fact that the lullabies play through the camera - just use the child's favorite stuffed animal, music box, or other means to help it fall asleep.  Once the kid learns these lullabies exist, they will expect to hear them while sleeping, and it will reduce the usefulness of the monitor.I don't use the lullabies anymore, and I never used the zoom functions.  The night light offers the perfect amount of light, and the monitor's auto-on and off features are pretty good.  If you want to spend more money, you can get additional cameras (i'm thinking about getting a second one), and the monitor has the ability to scroll through each monitor one-by-one.  I can't speak to how well this feature works.  All in all, I think this is a great baby monitoring system.",5

"OXO Tot Feeding Spoon Set, Green","It's the dumbest thing because it's just a spoon, but it does make it easier for a newbie like me to feed my baby his first solids!  The shape is just right to aim it right in, then alley-oop up out of the mouth, depositing the food to the back of baby's tongue and scraping the remainder off as you slide it up and out of baby's mouth.  Feeding is less messy and much more productive.  And, it's very soft for baby to gum or chew.  I was using the Munchkin spoons, but these just work better (and the Munchkin ones have kind of a sharp edge around the bowl that I was concerned may cut my baby's gums).",5
Munchkin Dora The Explorer Toddler Dining Set,This is a very cute toddler plate & utensil set. It's very durable and the colors are bright. I definitely recommend this product.,5
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Walk-Thru, Neutral finish","I've been using this gate in a 68"" opening, and it is perfect. It's strong, doesn't bow or shake. Other reviewers mentioned that the max length is achieved by having bolts stick way out of the wall - at 68"", the bolts are very short.The latch at the top of the gate has been worn loose by me tugging upward at the gate without pushing the button first. If you dislike the latch like I did, be aware that you can wear it out!Installation was a two-person job, but straight-forward.",5

We have two (one in the crib, one in the wash kind of thing) and they both look so worn already. He loves to chew on them and they are so ratty and no matter how much you wash them they still don't smell fresh! I would love to just buy him two new ones and get rid of the old ones but at $24 each that's not going to happen. I wish that I had bought him a cheap lovey in the beginning as most of my friends did and they just replace them every few months at a fraction of the cost. If they halved the price I would give this 5 stars and keep buying them!",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I have been nursing and am now switching our daughter to abottle.  We've tried several different bottles and these were the ones my daughter will take.

"Blueberry Coveralls Diaper Cover Snap, Butterflies",i've used imse vimse covers over the years and chose them over my experience with thirsties and bummis. but i recently got these and cannot say enough great things. mine says blueberry on it - it looks like swaddlebees (another name?) - this diaper cover is just amazing. it stands up to washing and drying and it fits well and protects well (your little one and his/her clothes or bedding). i've tried many diaper covers and all-in-ones. i like to use these the most out of my entire stash.,5
36 x 20 Bedrail,"I bought 2 of these rails (in white) and the instructions do say to be used with a matress & boxspring. I had to use commonsense to install it since the instructions are of no real help. We have a twin size bed with a high matress for our 2 yrs. The square bar is just below the top of the matress so that it does not touch her when she's sleeping. She's been taking her naps in her bed and no roll overs or falling out. So far so good. The only con is the instructions. It does not say how to fold it down. I got it by looking at the image. When you have the lower bar set to unlock,each of the hidged bars have arrows on it. Pull them up at the same time and voila! it folds down! Sorry if my comment is long but I want to give out as much info for those who are thinking about buying it, especially those that cannot figure out how to fold it down.",4
"The First Years True Fit SI C680 Car Seat, Naturalization","Easy to install and apparently comfortable.  This is the second The First Years convertible car seat that we bought and it is just as easy to install as the first one was.  I am not sure why people think this is a difficult install...all you have to do is attach the latches to the anchors, put all your weight into the seat and tighten that puppy down.  Installed in less than 2 minutes.  Just like the first seat.As our second daughter is 9 months old, she is still rear facing.  The seat does take up a lot of room that way.  We have this in an Explorer and my wife is pretty uncomfortable driving but since it is only for 3 months she is dealing with it.  The reason for this is we needed to install the top headrest which is pushing the overall footprint for this car seat even further into the front seat.  If you have a smaller car, this may be an issue (just a word of warning).  I would not not purchase this seat because of that though.Our daughter seems to love this seat and as a ton of room to stretch out.  Prior to getting  this seat she would rarely sleep in the car...now she is out within 2 minutes.",5

Baby Bee-Haven Swing n' Smart,"I have to admit when my mom bought this for me I didn't understand what a great gift it was.  My daughter is 10 months old and we just started putting her in the bucket swings in the park two months ago.  She LOVES THEM. Its getting cold now in Colorado but on a crisp day I still take her for some fresh air.  She is always pointing at the swings, I was worried about the cold seat and her hands getting cold on the chain but then I remembered I had this Swingen Smart. Brilliant!  I will not leave home without it all winter.I know its supposed to be protection against germs but for me that is just an added plus.  This is going to allow my daughter to swing happily all winter long.",5
Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"This monitor was the best we've tried(in the end-4 bought &amp; 3 returned) It is very clear- as it's name points out. The pros- very clear,both units are slim-not bulky like nost, baby's unit stands up or lays flat, comes WITH rechargable batteries,doesn't pick up much outside noise. My biggest problem is that if the parent &amp; baby units are too close, espically with the parent unit on a high setting, they both give a shreaking noise- but that can easily be avoided.",5
"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","I purchased the extra tall pressure mounted gate because of the increased height, auto close feature, multi-directional swing and simple installation.

"Graco SmartSeat All-in-One Car Seat, Jemma","I spend hours, over many days trying to pick out the best car seat for my daughter after outgrowing her Graco 30. I really love the concept of this seat. I will never have to buy another car seat EVER. The expiration date on these is a long time. We first purchased the Britax Marathon 70. It is nice with its padded straps and crotch snap. I didn't like how her feat already touched the back of the seat. I know they say kids don't mind, but I do. It looks terribly uncomfortable at a certain point and we plan to rear face for a while. That brings me to another point. I was told that the shell of this is the same height as the Britax but I don't really think that is true. I'm not an expert in car seats, but this one looks much taller than the Britax. One con I had heard about this seat is that it is so big and heavy. It is heavy because it is reinforced with steel. A steel reinforced car seat was a must for us. Although the car seat crash tests are not released we will never know of these more expensive seats are safer. I do believe steel is much safer than plastic. My older daughter had a plastic car seat and it was so flimsy. It even cracked in 1 year of use. Ok, back to the things I love. I love how much it reclines. I do not like seeing my daughters head flopped over. It is so easy to buckle. I'm used to graco, and the Graco 30 was a pain to unbuckle. This one is much easier. It also has a pad around the crotch, so you don't have to go digging for the crotch snap. As far as my knowledge is, this is the only convertable car seat on a base. So you can buy an additional base for another car. The price on this seat has gotten even better. It is such a great buy. I would buy it again in a New York minute if we needed another car seat.",5
Bugaboo Cameleon Adapter for Select Maxi-Cosi Car Seats,"I read all the reviews and was nervous about using this product.  What if I couldn't get these adapters off and ended up stuck somewhere with a crying baby???  Nightmare, right?  But it was too difficult for my husband and me to transfer our baby out of the car seat each time, not to mention we'd wake her up.  So I decided to ordered this and tested them at home several times before venturing out with them.  Here are some tips to getting them to work properly:1.  Right and left are the opposite of your right and left as others have mentioned.,2.  Use your foot to step down on the tire or other part of the stroller, push the grey button on the car seat, and use both hands to pull one side of the car seat off the adapter at a time.  I know, that's totally crazy and you shouldn't have to do this but it does work!3.  When installing the adapters make sure the white latch is engaged.  It needs to be flush with the black part of the adapter.  If it is not that means the latch is not locked and you need to manually move the white latch over.  If it won't move over double check that the ""prongs"" or ""teeth"" on the bottom have been inserted properly.  Once it's correctly in you can move the white latch or lock over to engage.4.  After you use this item... I don't know... maybe about 50 times or so it will ""loosen"" and get easier to remove from the stroller.  The first dozen or so times I really really struggled but now not so much (granted you still have to work at it and that will probably never change even after a thousand uses.  Just poor design.)If you already have the maxi-cosi car seat and the bugaboo stroller and really have no other option to change either car seat or stroller I would recommend buying these adapters.  Yes, they are a huge pain but they do work.  It is way better than not having them and once you get used to working them you will be happy you bought them.  Note to bugaboo: Redesign this item, please!  Esp given the high cost and consistent trouble users report.",3
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"My son got this from his grand-parents for Christmas a few months ago.  Contrary to the ""professional"" people who leave comments to scare people away and make others feel like they are bad parents, this saucer is wonderful.  Lots of little things to catch a childs eye, and many things for them to play with.  My son is 6 months old and I will place him in the saucer for a quick shower or so I can start dinner.  I don't recommend getting one of these and keeping your child in it all day long, but for when you need a minute this is great.  Very sturdy and it also scrunches down for easy storage.  My father-in law researched quite a few, and I will admit I was against the exer-saucers at first.  However, when I actually became a parent to a very high-maintenance child...this tends to give me a minute if needed and gives my son a little recess time of his own.",5
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,"Ordered this gate and it was here in two days!!!  It was super easy to install...did it by myself!  :-). Dogs are not afraid to go in and out of it when open which is a plus since one of my dogs is a little timid.  I purchased this gate to keep them out of my bedroom at night because they were keeping me awake getting in and out of bed.  They are still able to see me, but they can't hog my bed anymore.  Works like a dream.  I have read reviews about the tension mounting being wobbly but we have ours up that way and it is very sturdy.  My 5 year old is able to open it to come in and out which is good for me since he isn't the one I'm trying to keep out.  Seems like a good product to me!",5
"Bumkins Dr. Seuss 2 Piece Pajama Set, Green/Yellow, 12 Months","I ordered 2 other pairs of these pajamas they came straight from amazon they got here sooner with free shipping. I want a few days longer for this pair and the shipping cost from the store was stunning. the pjs. where 14.95 and the cost of this one pair was over 8.00 that is a very big turn off. I could have bought another pair of pjs. If it had came overnight that would be different. I was pleased with the pajamas in every other way. but I would never by straight from this seller again. I got ripped off. Thanks and I hope you look into how much you charge for shipping. They where one pair of tiny baby pajamas. Thanks, Diana",4

I use it throughout the day but it's especially helpful at night and when someone else is watching baby (no need to ask me when last diaper change or feeding was).The nightlight feature is handy too because it shuts off on it's own.The only improvement to this simple gadget would be to add a function that keeps track of how many total feedings in a day.",4

Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"I know this product my sound gross, but it really works. Granted the first time you use it you may gag, but the results make it well worth it. I tried sucking my babies nose out with a nasal aspirator and it never seemed to get it all. The Nosefrida creates a seal that helps to get more stuff out of your child's nose. The filter keeps any of it from getting to you, but I never had it suck up that far. The Nosefrida also comes apart for easy cleaning.",5
Lansinoh Diaper Rash Ointment 3 oz (85 g),"I found out about this product last summer when my 18 month old had diarrhea on and off for over three months. When none of the other major brands worked, I resorted to anti-fungal creams; however, those did not work, so I kept searching. The Lansinoh cream was the only thing I could find that would help heal severe diaper rash. I don't use it as an everyday barrier (due to the price), but I keep it around in case my babies start to develop a rash. Definitely worth the price, but hard to find in stores...I order it on Amazon (wish they'd make it Prime eligible).",5

The first day I received the Sleepsuit I tried it that night and like magic she fell asleep. I was able to put her in her crib and she slept there all night from 9pm until 7am the next morning! She even woke up with the biggest smile on her face. I've used it every night since, wash it regularly, and still works like magic!!",5

"Maclaren Easy Traveller Stroller, Black and Silver","I had a travel system with my first child but hated to use it because it was so bulky, once he was of an age to use them I generally took cheap umbrella strollers everywhere.  When he was 2 his legs were too long for the umbrella strollers but he still needed a stroller for trips and long outings.  I invested in the Maclaren Volo, an 8 lb. umbrella stroller and absolutely loved it.  Since the stroller part of our travel system broke I went in search of a infant stroller to get through the first 6 months with our new baby until it is big enough to ride in the Volo.  I was overjoyed when I found this car seat carrier by Maclaren.  It is a brand I really like and my old infant car seat fits easily.  It was slightly wider and larger than I expected (11 lbs.)but folds up to about the size of an umbrella stroller when not in use.  Can't wait for the baby to arrive and take long walks with our new stroller.",5

Our SkipHop Diaper Kit is far superior in terms of design.  It has all the same parts including the wipe case but once you fill it the kit still closes!

"Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat, Mystique","I purchased this car seat online through BRUS about a month ago and have the Gemni (purple) color. It was all that was available and even though I have a boy it's a very deep purple and not ""girlie"".I have very similar sentiments as the first reviewer. Prior to buying this one I bought and tested the Radian Diono, SafetyFirst Air (65), Britax Pavilion and Recaro ProRide. This car seat was my absolute favorite (The Recaro ProRide was up there except it's latch anchor belt is surprisingly/ridiculously too short and I could not install it into my 2008 Hyundai Tuscan, a compact SUV. I had no problem installing any of the other car seats with the latch anchor system so the Recaro was completely out of the running, which was a bummer because it did seem very nice). Right now we are using it rear-facing for my 9-month old who recently grew out of his Chicco Keyfit. He is approximately 28 inches tall and 19 lbs. (his head in the infant seat while sitting was more than an inch from the edge). We have successfully installed it into a 2008 Hyundai Tuscan, a 2003 Toyota Highlander and a conversion van (no clue the make/model or year but it didn't have latch anchors).Ease of Installation and Tight Fit - **********(10/5)Installation is the easiest of all of the convertible carseats we tried tried. Well...with the latch anchor that is. We transferred into a van that didn't have anchors and spent 10 minutes trying to figure out how to use the seatbelt to install. The photos on the car seat didn't help at all. Maybe it's just us, but we aren't dumb people and my husband eventually had to look up a video online in order to figure it out (there isn't actually a video that shows how to do it rear-facing either, only forward-facing but we finally figured it out.) The numbered base is awesome (neither of us were comfortable using a pool noodle or towel to secure a car seat), and makes it SO easy to change the angle. It kind of makes you wonder why this wasn't done by any other car seat company ever before. The bubble level - also ingenious, I mean really, why no other car seat company puts one on their car seats is beyond me. Being able to VISUALLY see instantly whether or not your car seat is installed properly so you can quickly and easily make the adjustment could mean the difference of life or death of your child. Again, not sure why every car seat out there isn't equipped with better visual indicators. The latch system allows you to get a TIGHT fit in less than a minute. Shake the car seat and it doesn't move. It was the absolute tightest fit we got with the least amount of time effort of all the car seats we tested. For installation ease and fit this car seat gets 10 stars!Size - ****.* (4.5/5)The first car seat I tried was the Radian Diono because it goes up to 120 lbs. forward facing and I wouldn't need to buy another car seat. The problem with that concept, however, for us was that the passenger seat had to be moved all the way forward in order to get it to fit (we have it installed behind the passenger seat). This would obviously be an even greater issue as we add additional car seats and we can't push the driver seat up much. The Britax Pavilion and Safety First were also too long when we tried to get the angle right. The NextFit and ProRide were the only two that fit nicely behind the passenger seat without having to move the seat up too much. What I like better about the KeyFit though is that the side protectors aren't as huge as the ProRide and my child can still see out the window. He is still getting the side impact protection without sacrificing his view. The Radian was the easiest car seat to get my child into and out of from a spacing standpoint. The ProRide was pretty tight and he's only 9 months old. SafetyFirst was decent as is the KeyFit. The sides of the carseat come up a bit more than some of the others (it's a bit wider) but I still have ample space to get my son in and out without banging his head on the car. Like I said, it is a bit wider so there is no way you could get more than 2 car seats in your back seat and I'm not sure you could fit a third person along with the two car seats (Recaro ProRide boasts fitting 3 across the back) so if you need that option the KeyFit might not be your car seat. In comparing the size, sturdiness, weight (it's heavy - in a good way - but not crazy heavy if you are transferring often, it's manage) to the others I think they KeyFit is among the best. I think an easy addition for Chicco is a small handle of some sort on the back to make transporting it easier. There's really not much you can grab onto towards the top/back, which forces you to sort of wrap your whole arms around it to lift it. I'd love a small handle/grip area to just pick it up with one hand. For that I give this area 4.5 stars.Height Adjustable Harness (no need to re-thread, just pull up/push down) - **** (4/5)I love this feature! It allows you to get the best possible fit for your child in his/her seat very quickly without taking anything apart and re-threading. Other convertible car seats have this ability to easily move the straps up and down (SafetyFirst Air was a button too, and the Recaro ProRide has a circular crank you turn on both sides) but not as great as the Nextfit. SafetyFirst Air wouldn't go low enough and my son's head didn't even come close to the side protectors. The NexFit slide goes down nice and low. The slide however, is sticky, and definitely doesn't slide as easily as the SafetyFirst or Recaro, but I'm hoping it's just because it's new and needs a little movement. Though at this price point and from Chicco I would expect it to work flawlessly. So it only gets 4 stars.Padding/Comfort - (Pending) ****.* (4.5/5)The padding is great in this car seat. Going from the KeyFit where you could feel the plastic through the padding, Chicco really stepped it up with the NextFit. It is plush and has almost a memory foam feel. The only concern I have (as other reviewers do) is the breathability of it, especially during the summer. We are still experiencing snow here in May (lovely MN) but had 2 days of 70 degree weather and when I pulled my son out of the car seat after an hour long car ride he was wet on his back and the back of his head. This is a bit concerning to me as we had the air on and I was even a little chilly in the car. I am definitely concerned about how it will perform on long road trips so I would warn buyers to test this during warm weather if possible. I will not hesitate to return this car seat if it is going to make my son sweaty and uncomfortable. Because of this I can only give this area 4 stars right now instead of 5. (I will update once I can test this better). However, the material is easy enough to wipe down, which is also important so I'll bump it up to 4.5 stars.Harness/Straps - * (1/5) UPDATE **** (3.5/5)UGH. This is the ONLY thing I hate about the car seat. We were coming from the KeyFit and the NextFit is pretty much identical as far as the tightening system goes. Only it takes WAY too much effort to get it snug - and nearly impossible to get it tight. I think a lot of it has to do with some sort of design flaw when the seat is actually installed and the child is sitting in the seat. Because sitting on the floor in our living room we can tighten and loosen that thing super easily. But once it's installed, you're trying to pull the strap back toward your child, not down, but the strap is wedged between the seat and the carseat and it is SO hard to budge (we did notice you have to make sure the headrest of the seat in front is not touching the car seat because the belt goes through the back and is exposed so if it's touching and pushing on it, that can prevent you from being able to tighten the strap). Even after we noticed that though the strap is STILL very hard to tighten. I think the shoulder pads might be getting in the way too, it's hard to tell. I hate the size of the shoulder pads. They are WAY too big for my son and I cannot remove them. That is a BIG fail to me. When I buckle him in and push the plastic buckle part up so it is across his chest in the right spot the shoulder pads overlap onto the buckle and are so long they touch the back of the car seat. If I could remove them perhaps we could get a tighter fit and as he gets bigger I am hoping this is no longer an issue. Right now I have to yank and yank and yank and yank to get it as tight as I can and it still doesn't feel or look tight enough. It's also impossible to do the pinch test because of the shoulder pads. That also annoys me. Chicco did SO well on everything else, it saddens me that this important aspect was the worst out of all the car seats I tested. Don't judge by playing with it at the store. You have to install it and put your kid in and test it out before you can get a sense for the difficulty of this. This was actually the reason I ordered the Recaro ProRide (which didn't end up fitting in my car or it may have replaced the KeyFit). The only redeeming quality of the harness/straps system is that there are two different buckle points for rear-facing vs. forward-facing. I'm not really sure how big of deal this is, but if it truly does provide added safety I think that it is a really great feature. That earns this area 1 single star.UPDATE: I moved the head part up and was able to tighten the harness MUCH easier! Super happy about that. The shoulder straps are still annoying so I will bump this part up to a 3.5. I still think this should still be easier and none of the other of the other car seats I tested were this difficult. I think some re-design/tweaking here could make the KeyFit really blow all the other convertible car seats in its class out of the water. I mean, simply having removable shoulder pads would be huge!Despite the issues with tightening, this is still my favorite car seat out of all of the ones we tested. There are so many great things about it and I am still working on troubleshooting the harness/straps because I truly think it's something that is fixable. I've been in contact with Chicco customer service and am just trying to coordinate a time/date I can be on the phone with them while my son is strapped in and patient enough to let us troubleshoot it.I'm not sure why it took Chicco this long to come out with a convertible car seat but I'd like to think it was because they were really fine-tuning a really awesome concept that is among the best out there. With so many out there at so many different price points it can be hard to decide. This car seat is by far the easiest to use (of the ones we tested) with the most features that ensure and VISIBLY show the safety and security of my child so I know I'm putting him in safely every time. Nothing against people who use pool noodles or towels to get the right angle...I just think if I am spending that much money on something it should come with everything I need to get the right fit. I don't ever want to have to ""guess"" if my child's car seat is installed correctly or he's strapped in correctly or angled correctly. Chicco takes the guesswork out of everything so you can transport your child with confidence and peace of mind every time.Gosh, I sound like an infomercial. Lol.I hope this helps though!:)UPDATE: Okay, so I figured out I had threaded the Recaro ProRide latch belt through the forward facing area and there is a different rear-facing area (so when I previously said I wasn't dumb...I may need to retract that statement). I still have the car seat so I tried it again and sure enough it fit! However because the back seats in my SUV slant back somewhat, there was still a gap where the base didn't meet the seat when I tilted the car seat back to have the line parallel to the seat...I tried for 20 minutes to get it installed tightly without having to put anything in that gap and finally gave up and decided to stick with the Chicco KeyFit. The ProRide would definitely be my second choice though. The button to release the belt that tightens the harness is a bit more hidden and harder to access than the KeyFit (though super easy to tighten) and some of the foam from the padding is exposed near the crotch belt, which makes me nervous with dirt/food/spills. Those are things I could live with, however not being able to easily get the right seat angle isn't. I think this would be an awesome forward facing seat. The ProRide's material seemed more breathable than the KeyFit but we will see...summer needs to reach us here first in MNUPDATE 1/16/14: Just adding another update as we've now had the carseat(s) for almost 10 months. Just want to say that I've noticed something important that affects my ability to tighten the straps - the air temperature. We have hit some record lows here in MN this winter (-45 with the wind chill) and if I do not have my car warmed up before I put my son in it, it is SO very difficult to tighten the straps. I didn't consider this before with my review because I didn't think about that being a factor, but it absolutely is. Once the car is warmer though the straps move much more easily. So I'm not sure this is a design flaw...but this is still my only complaint about the carseat. The straps are still annoying but I don't notice them as much now that he's bigger. We've also gotten a minivan (Honda Odyssey) that we now have this carseat in (second baby on the way) and it was just as easy to install and fits wonderfully. My son is nearly 18 months old now and around 28 lbs. and 32"" tall, which is considered average for height and weight (he's a little rounder than he is tall though). He still fits very easily and comfortably into this carseat rear-facing. I can definitely see us being able to keep him rear-facing until he is 2. Right now his feet don't even touch the seat because the carseat is angled back and he sits in it fairly deeply. I'm very happy that I can continue to keep him comfortably rear-facing in this seat as I've had many friends turn their kids forward because their kids became uncomfortable in their carseat rear-facing. So if that is important to you and your child is ""averageish"" percentile (or lower) for height and weight you will probably be able to keep them rear-facing until 2. I will post another update though once he's 2 and verify that we were able to do this.",4
"Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Tan","Fits perfectly in my car and my hubby's. We got extra bases, one for Daddy's car and one for Grandma's.

Purple Woogie Fee Plush Kid Case for iPhone and iPod touch,My daughter got one for her birthday and so I had to test this thing out lol. It has so many uses so it will definitely pay for itself in the long run. I watch kids a lot and let's face it technology has become part of our lil one's lives. I have tons of movies on my phone so this works well with kids holding it cause they drop things. It is soft and plush yet firm enough to sit in pretty much any position on your lap. I know some people complain about the plastic screen but if you are watching a movie your screen isn't hard to see. Now playing a game it's awkward to hold. This woogie comes with an app you can download that has a face that matches your woogie. Your toddler might like the face cause you can poke it shake it tickle it and the woogie laughs and says things. You can also take woogie on adventures in the app so the older kids can play too might have to take the phone out to play some games but all in all good product.  I have a galaxy s4 and it fits great. Only one thing I wish this product has was a spot to put headphones. Oh and if you don't put it in or take it out your toddler won't figure it out so fast lol.,5

"Naturepedic Waterproof Flat Portacrib Pad, 24x38","I originally bought 3 Naturepedic waterproof portacrib pads to use in play yards & their bassinets, and as my children grew, have added crib & twin sized pads, and discovered that 3 portacrib pads, slightly overlapping, will perfectly cover a twin sized bed. On a twin bed, usually only 1 of the 3 pads will get wet at a time, but even on the rare occassion that all 3 get soaked, 3 small pads seem to fit in the washer easier than one big twin-sized pad.  My original 3 pads are still in great shape after several years of use with multiple refluxers & diaper soak-thrus, and machine wash & dry.  With a growing family, I ordered an additional set of portacrib pads which are thinner, softer, and more flexible than the originals, but seem to hold up to overnight soakings just fine.",5
"Disney 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set, Taking The Race",Just what was needed to bring my grandson into his &#34;big boy bed&#34; from a crib/day bed.Very colorful and cheerful.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"My daughter absolutely adores her play mat. She likes the hanging toys and the music. I like the baby initiated music feature. She kicks the bar or pulls a toy and the music starts again, keeping her interested. There are plenty of attachments, so we have attached our own toys as well, and there is plenty of options for play time. The mat also has little tabs and a crinkle leaf to make tummy time more interesting. The only complaint I have is the mirror toy, which as another reviewer mentioned hangs in such a manner that baby can't really see herself in the mirror. Overall I am very happy with the toy, and it is definitely my daughter's favorite.",5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll",Love how it's so easy to attach to almost any infant seat and they love the sounds colors and movement.,5
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Activity Gym,"I purchased this gym for our first son. He loves it!  When doing research this gym had the best dangling toys and many extra hooks for adding our own toys. The dangling toys are interesting (see through rattles, bells, mirror, squeaks, etc) and high quality.  The toys also have size appropriate features to help their fine motor skills, wooden rings to grab, small orange feet to pinch.Also the base mat is interesting with a built in mirror. This made tummy time more fun which helped him stay on tummy longer. When we just put him on a blanket he cried sooner therefore shortening overall time. He was rolling front to back at 3 months repeatedly and I credit this gym a lot. (When you put him on belly, put the toys up over the support so they don't hit his head)Only thing I'd add is more interactive play on the mat. It does have a squeaker, some crinkly leaves but I would love something that would make music or noise when he kicks.We started using this at about 2-weeks old and still use it extensively at 4-month!",4
The First Years All Purpose Steam Sterilizer,"I use the Playtex Drop-Ins bottle system to feed my baby, so I needed a better and safer alternative than boiling to sterilize the nipples and such.I chose this particular steam sterilizer, since it seemed to be the easiest to use, it got good reviews and would work for what I needed it for.I like this a lot, it saves time and sterilizes like it's supposed to.The things that I don't like is that it's not large enough to fit the bottles (I thought it was a lot larger and was kind of disappointed at how small it was when it arrived), only the caps, nipples, closing rings, pacifiers and other small items. It doesn't have a drying feature, so like with boiling, I have to wait till everything cools down and air drys before I can use anything.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,I highly recommend this baby toy to every parent. Both of my children have loved Jacques the Peacock and I always buy this toy for expectant parents/baby shower gift. There are so many cool & stimulating features of this toy including the mirror and the bright colors. Enjoy!,5
"Stork Craft Bradford 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib Changer, Espresso","really like the look and quality of this crib/changer. we got the white one - its all solid wood and feels really sturdy and high quality, which feels like a score for the price.  when i first looked at the assembly directions i panicked, but i was determined to do it (at 35 weeks pregnant!) and it wasn't so bad. it took me about 4 hours by myself. helps to have an electric drill. the only think i will say is that the box looked like it fell of the back of a truck when it arrived. it was all torn up and the styrofoam inside was all broken and shredded. miraculously all the parts were fine though.  the drawers and back shelves offer really nice extra storage options.",5
Safety 1st 36 Pack Secure Press Plug Protectors,"My 2 year old twins can pull these out very easily. I caught them pulling them out and trying to plug in an electrical cord. They are looser in the plug than most brands, and the little 'button' you push to make it easy to be removed by adults can be pushed by a child. I am replacing ours.... these should be recalled.",1
"Boon Water Bugs Floating Bath Toys with Net,Orange",I bought this for my one year old and he loves it.  Great for the pool or bath.  I would recommend this toy.,4
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","I bought this blanket for a friend who is having a little girl.  This is now my ""go to"" shower gift!  I bought one for my 5 week old son who was only sleeping 2 hours at a time.  As soon as I started swaddling him in the miracle blanket, his sleep increased to 4-5 hours at a time!  He's 4 months old now & we're still using the blanket.  In fact, when he sees it, he starts smiling!  He loves getting wrapped up at night.  Once I wrap him, he falls asleep in 5-10 minutes.  This is a must have for babies that have difficulity sleeping.",5
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","I have 3-4 different ones around the house and this is my favorite so far. Like the locking mechanism, just a good product.",5
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia",We love this chair! It is super easy to put on and take off but is also very secure. Our little guy is still a little small for it (but desperately wants to be part of the action) so we just stuff a blanket around him. It folds up so it is fairly easy to travel with. The fabric is a sturdy material. I haven't had to clean it yet.,5
"Delta 30 Count Set of Kids Velvet Hanger, Pink","I ordered these hangers to go in addition with the delta nursey organizer.  They are the perfect size for my toddlers clothes and I love the velvet material.  They help avoid from the clothes slipping off easily.The hanges themselves are great, but receiving them was a hassle.  There is apparently some confusion on Amazon's (Packaging) end as I only received 1 pack of 10 hangers when ordered them.  I had to order them 3 times and request a refund/credit for the two additional orders just to get the advertised 30 hangers.  (I confirmed on other retailers website that this indeed IS suppose to be a 30 pack and Amazon confirmed thats what their records indicate).",4
"Stork Craft Metal Glider and Ottoman, Black/Beige","I owned this chair well over a 1.5 years. We actually just replaced it, and yes we replaced it with a differnet glider.There were some major pluses, but there were also some draw backs.Pluses:I loved the pockets on the sides.The fabric was so easy to clean (just wipe it down).The recline was awesome, as was the swivle.It was so comfortable. The armrest were at the perfect height to help support my baby's weight.It was also very easy to rock.Minuses:I did not like how much space it took up (that base is huge).I hated the squeaking. It didn't matter how much WD-40 I put on it, it squeaked. I think (if I remember right) the squeaking started about 7/8 months after we got it.Then the kicker was when it broke. There is a post that concets the base to the chair. The post snaped, so for a few days we lived with a wobbly chair. When we moved it to replace it, it fell apart.For the amount I spent on it I expected it to last longer.",3

"Bright Starts Start Your Senses Safari Activity Gym, Spots and Stripes","Captivating. Very versitile play for baby. The little tiger comes off and can travel with you, which is nice. The music is catchy. Plus it has some nature sounds that are great for soothing. The lights arent overbearing and the attachable toys are quite cute. My son especially liked the chimes. The mirror has a bit of funhouse effect but he didnt mind, he could still see himself so he was happy. Overall, this is an awesome activity gym.",5

"Frenchie Girls Fashion Jewelry Bib, Pink","Nice. Wide on the shoulders to keep messes down. Love the stitching and the waterproof middle.The only thing is that it wrinkles up in the wash, or rather in the dryer. It says you can use an iron but c'mon, I don't have time to iron baby bibs. I just stretch it out a little by hand. Not a big deal, but it is a little wrinkly now. Doesn't affect how it works, though! Still just as waterproof.",4
Metalica Pliko P3 MT Stroller,The under carriage storage compartmet is very uncomfortable. I have a HARD time trying to put my medium size baby bag in the basket every time; So I just don't use it. I have to either carry the bag or hang it on the strollers handle.,3
Evenflo Comfort Select Performance Dual Electric Breast Pump,"With my first child, I breastfed for 9 months and worked full time. This pump seemed to do the job quite effectively! I would not know if it is noisy or not considering I have never used another pump, but it is not bothersome. I gave it 4 stars because both side are quite heavy and for a multitasking mom it is impossible to use a pumping bra. Other than that, I would say this is a great buy!",4
"Gerber 4 Pack Prefold Birdseye Solid Diaper, Pink",I like to use these to add embellishments on for baby gifts. I like that they come in a variety of colors and wash well. They are also a nice size (so many burp cloths now are long but skinny). I will buy these again. The only reason I am giving four stars is because they are not super high quality...but it's fine for the price. :),4
"Summer Infant CushyStraps, Pink","We were going on a long car trip and I didn't want my daughter to have a neck cramp so we purchase this.  It didn't keep her head straight but I think it did give her a nice cushion to rest her head.  Also, it's super cute.",3

Just Gingham Furniture/Drawer Knobs - Color: Petal Pink,"I received this item a few months ago, and just got around to opening up the package recently. I was dismayed that there was only one (1) knob in the package, and nothing else. This came with no hardware whatsoever, not even on the back of the knob itself. You should know that if you order this, you are only getting one of these.",3
"Green Sprouts Cornstarch Hand Teether PVC, BPA, and Petroleum Free!","This has been a favorite of both my babies!

Perfect for a first rattle!",5

"Dream On Me Zodiak Portable Playard, Navy","We have the Joovy Room and this. We bought this for our temporary housing when we were moving. We also purchased the mattress (Dream on Me - cheap one). It is lightweight, compacts to a small size, is comfy, and fits standard play sheets. The Joovy is under a bed somewhere and we use this all the time for sleepovers, playing, napping and general containment needs.",5
"Colgate Mattress 3 Sided Contour Changing Pad, Quilted White","I live right down the street from the Colgate factory so when it was time to buy a matrress and changing pad I immediately checked out Colgate's selections!  I bought an antique dresser as a changing table and the changing pad fits perfectly!  Also, the curves on edge of the pad are high enough to help ensure that the baby does not roll around too much!  Overall great purchase!",5
"OXO Tot Roll Up Bib, Aqua","So, I've been using this OXO bib for a few weeks now, and I'm actually surprised that it has held up as well as it has. Our daughter is ten months old, and every bib she has is pretty disgusting looking at this point. Not to mention that some are a pain to put on. OXO has a good chunk of benefits over the everyday cloth ones we used to use.1. The material: It is super easy to just wipe off most anything that falls on the bib, and the pouch is just everyday plastic that is also easy to clean. Just run the thing under some warm water and you are done most of the time.2. The pocket: Our other bibs are flat, and I'm not sure why we waited this long to get one with a pocket. The lower half of our child almost always ends up being covered in food paste, crumbs, or whatever is with in arms reach honestly. Our Australian shepherd used to sit by her high chair at dinner time so she could pick up the scraps. Unfortunately for her, there really are no scraps that miss the pocket for her to eat.3. The velcro: Velcro is so hit or miss with us since our daughter will just pull it apart if it isn't decently made, but we've had no problems with this bib.So, yeah, it's a bib, but it's a darn good bib. I would highly recommend it to parents who don't want to save on a bib load of laundry every week, and keep those pants clean a little longer.",5

Boba Baby Carrier Teething Pad - Natural,I purchased these at the same time I purchased my Boba so I put them on before I tried the carrier out on my baby for the first time. The second I put him in the carrier he started chewing on these teething pads. If I hadn't put them on he would have been chewing directly on the carrier. The carrier instructions say not to put it directly in the washing machine so I feel much better knowing that he was chewing on the pads (which I washed first in baby detergent). Plus I bought a few extra sets so if he is in the carrier for a long period of time and gets the pads really wet I can easily change them out. I would say these are a must have for your baby carrier while your baby is teething or for babies who just like to chew.,5

The First Years Nature Sensations Lullaby Player,"This product was not was I expected.

Nice creamy color too.",5
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","This is a great alternative to having pillows all around me. It's fairly comfortable, however getting out of it once you're in is tricky. Also, with a queen sized bed it takes up more of my share. Good product though.",4
Hello Kitty diecut face shape Area Rug 30 X 25 inches,"I would hesitate to call this a rug because it is so thin and it had a petroleum odor.  I had bought it for my 5 year old granddaughter's room, but did not want to give it to her because of the odor.  I had nothing to lose, so I washed it in the washing machine.  This did help and it did not harm the felt-looking appliques.  She uses it by her bed and it looks cute; I feel better about it since I was able to wash it; however there were no tags on it to tell how to care for it, so I took a chance that it could have ruined it.",2

"Gift Mark Honey Deacon Style Toy Box with Spindle Back and Casters, Honey",I bought this for my grandson. It was difficult to put together as holes were not drilled in spots where they should have been. The bottom of the box wasn't cut square so it doesn't touch on both sides. The cover rubs the left side when it shuts. I feel as if I paid alot of money for the finished product!,3

"Pearhead Signature Frame, White","I used two of these frames for a baby shower game in which I put pictures of a boy and a girl baby morphed from pictures of the mother and father to be in them. Instead of having shower guests sign their name to the matte, we had them write their baby name suggestions and then voted. It went great and the frames were nice and sturdy for writing. No pen in the box, but all the pens we used were fine as far as not bleeding, etc.",5
"Yellow &amp; Orange Sun, Blue &amp; White Clouds Wall Mural Stickers - Sticker Decals for Children's, Nursery &amp; Baby's Room Decor, Baby Walls, Girls Bedroom Decorations. Garden Cloud Suns Decal Child's Murals Birthday Party Baby Shower Decoration",From the images it was too hard to tell the quality of the product. They were hard and non-pliable and would have been ideal to stick to a whiteboard or posterboard but not a wall. They fell off within a day and are now in the garbage.,1
"C.R. Gibson Memory Book, Baby Bots","My wife and I bought this for our baby girl, and we absolutely love it. The design is great, and there is enough room to keep all the importante memories.",5
Tiny Love Tiny Princess Mobile,"I was hesitant to buy this at first, since it was brand new and there were no reviews out on it yet.  But, let me tell you - it was worth every penny!  This mobile is made by the same company as the popular 'symphony in motion' mobile, so the quality and durability is there.  For us, we loved the princess theme of the mobile and of course the cute pink colors.  Just like the symphony in motion mobile, the top part of the mobile can be detached from the music box base part.  There is a night lite option as well, and you can select either loud music or soft.  The classical songs that this mobile plays are perfect for soothing a tired baby or just as background music.  Another perk for us is the included remote control.  We hang it near our bed, so that we can operate it from across the room (baby's crib is in our bedroom).  If you are considering this mobile for your baby girl, we highly recommend it.",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red","I have scoliosis and so I really needed to make sure I had a good baby carrier to make sure I don't do further damage to my back. I had previously read reviews about the lumbar support for this carrier so that's why I bought it. So far, it's been pretty good. I can carry my 16-lbs baby for 2 hours pretty comfortably (still a bit sore on the shoulders afterwards, but it's not bad). The only thing I worry about is that the materials is pretty thick and it can probably get pretty hot. My baby hasn't complained yet though. I might recommend that you look into the newer Baby Bjorn Synergy which is suppose to be lightweight AND provides back support. But, if you like the Active carrier, Amazon really has the BEST price for this item!",4
WubbaNub Infant Pacifier Alligator - Limited Edition,I bought this pacifier to replace the puppy one we had that was lost.  I was excited when I saw that there was an alligator to chose from I had to get it since my son's room theme was baby alligator's.  This product &#34;Wubanub&#34; is a great product.  It is very durable and you are able to wash it easily in the wash!!,5

"BabyKicks Basic Cloth Diaper Snap Closure, Meadow","These fit WAY too snug. The video says up to 40lbs and it is too tight on my 29 lb 2 year old. The video also states these are bamboo velour inside with microfleece under the velour (similar to the old style snugglebees). Which is what sold me to buy these. However these are a simple PUL outer layer with a white microfleece inner.The insert is the typical stick-to-your-finger microfiber on one side with the hemp on the other. However they stuck the tag on the hemp side of the insert, which according to the description you are supposed to be able to place facing your child. But in my house this wont work since my child has sensitive skin and ANY tag causes her to itch like crazy. It is also hard to stuff as the insert feels too large for the diaper and is bunchy. In fact even if you don't stuff it and just lay it on top it still sticks almost an inch out the back. So I had to cut off almost an inch from the back of the insert and sew it closed. This cut the tag off (solving that issue) and also made the insert fit better into the diaper.Also after just one day of use one of the leg snaps just pulled out as I tried to unsnap this diaper!  I am returning the other three I purchased and would not buy these again.** UPDATE **  I just was researching around and found out that the video on this diaper is for theBabykicks 3G Pocket Diaper, Meadow/White Snapswhich DOES have the bamboo velour inner, contoured insert and fleece gussets.  The video needs to be removed off this listing.",1

Highly recommend!",5

Petunia Pickle Bottom **NEW Spring 13** City Carryall-Breakfast in Berkshire,"For my first child (now 16 months) I was so into the &#34;non-diaper&#34; bag that I bought a beautiful Lacoste bag instead. Big mistake. It was trendy and cool, but the lack of pockets and organization that a real diaper bag has ensured that I NEVER carried it - instead just stuffed random things in my purse which would all jumble at the bottom.  Now that i'm 5 months pregnant again, I am returning to my diaper bag search. I was advised to look at Petunia before but originally stopped looking at them because they are too cutesy - not really a diaper bag in disguise. But then I saw a CAKE by Petunia on pinterest and decided to look at the whole Petunia line again.I ordered the City Carryall, and the CAKE Society and Hampton. Ultimately, I kept the Hampton Holdall, but if the City had come in CAKE, I might have kept both.Highs1. Really good &#34;day&#34; size. I just need to carry, a couple bottles, some crackers, some face wipes, a small toy, and maybe one diaper for each kid - along with mom's phone and wallet. Extra clothes, full meals, etc are not what I need to fit.2. LOVE the built in diaper pad feature. Just perfect for those months when your new baby is pooping often enough to need to change it in public instead of waiting until you are home.3. Overall good organization pocket configuration - I hate it when it all jumbles at the bottom.Cons1. Besides the way the diaper changer zipped side creates a pocket, there is really only one main compartment. This makes it tough to dig for mom's wallet underneath the bag of crackers and face wipes. I really wanted a bag with 3 main compartments which is the main reason I'm keeping the Hampton Holdall.2. I'm not into the cutesy patterns all that much. I wanted a more incognito bag. I liked the patterns and the fabric quality much better than it shows in the pictures, but its still more &#34;baby&#34; than I hoped. The CAKE line is also bold colors, but they are more luxury purse like than the standard Petunia look. If the City had come in the CAKE line, I probably would have kept it as a 2nd bag.Other bags I considered were the Charlie by SoYoung, the Cake Society Satchel, and the Cake Hampton Holdall. I'm keeping the Hampton.",4
"Bumkins Waterproof Superbib, Blue Fizz","These types of bibs are a must have for any parent. WE got this one for a gift, but our Bumpkin waterproof bid that we used worked so well it was the only bid we needed. It kept our son clean while he was eating and it is easy to wash off.",5
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","I am generally happy with this stroller. I bought it for the following reasons:a. It's ability to add a second seat (I have one child now...but hope to have more in the future)b. The multiple positions and reclining options.c. Ability to manoeuvre easily on rough terrain (our roads aren't paved)d. It's good looks!!! Their ad got me!I got mine at Ideal Baby on sale with the chaperone car seat thrown in for free!!! Yeah!!! :) lol!However here are a list of my major concerns:1. This stroller is heavy (and I don't even have a second seat yet!) - We use this stroller at home for walks around the neighbourhood. This stroller is annoying to lug in and out of the trunk and difficult to fold up and unfold. We leave it opened out so it's easy on everyone in the house, baby-sitter and my mom included (cause they'll have zero help when they're ""on duty"" and we're not home). If we're going to the mall etc we use an UppaBaby stroller which is permanently in the trunk.2. The model we own was made in June 2011 and had a buckle that was really difficult to manoeuvre, it took ages for me to get my baby out of the stroller!!! Then one day I actually clipped my baby's skin in between the buckle! That was traumatic; it really hurt her (based on the way she screamed and cried almost unconsolably!). She's okay now of course, but still as the scar 5mths later. Anyways I called Britax to complain about the buckle and they sent me an entire new seat for free! So Customer Service is impressive. The buckle on the 2012 is waaay easier to operate.3. The arm bar has a foam covering over it for cushioning (I suppose). But as any other 8-12month old my baby nibbles at the foam!!! And x2 I saw black foam residue all over her mouth, the baby-sitter concurred with her determination to eat the arm bar so we decided to remove it totally. Which of course is removing a protective system. I am yet to contact Britax about this problem.4. It would be good if the seat can be turned rear or forward facing using a pivot rather than detaching the entire seat like the Orbit Baby (which is 3 times the cost of this stroller!). Because one moment we may be stroller with our backs to the sun and then the other moment we're facing the sun. And even though the canopy is large, it can only do so much. And you're not supposed to convert the seat while the baby is in it.Anyways so those are the major concerns with this stroller. But for the price (mid to high end) it has great features, solid safety ratings on their car seats and great customer service.  I think it's a great choice. Be sure to compare against the Baby Jogger City Select b4 you buy.",4
"Mary Meyer Print Pizzazz 12&quot; Plush Toy, Dots Giraffe","We now own two of these little guys.  You have to have a back up just in case one gets left on the top of the car, chewed up by the dog or dropped in the toilet (this last one actually happened).  Unfortunately, he can tell the difference between the two.It says spot clean but we've thrown ours in the wash machine and let it air dry on a rack.  My 2yr old is in love with this puppy - she comes everywhere with us.  She did get a little hole by the leg due to being pulled out of the crib between the slats too many times but sewed her up good as new.  There are some little balls/beans in her rear but I'm not worried about it.",5

"DaVinci Classic Sleigh Glider and Ottoman, Beige/Espresso Legs",If you are looking for a solid glider this DaVinci Glider is what you should buy. We are very impressed by the quality of the glider. It shipped extremely fast and was very easy to put together. This glider is definitely worth the price.,5
NUK Mash &amp; Serve Bowl,"Great system for mashing up food for baby.  Baby food is expensive, so this is a great way to smash the food we eat into a form that my son can eat.",5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"I live in a big, old house (with 4 floors) and this monitor only worked between 1 floor.  Interestingly, the less expensive monitor I bought before this one worked from the basement to the 3rd floor whereas this Sony only worked between 1 floor.  And, it beeps all the time for no reason.  I had to return it because even when it was working (which was not all the time) the beeping drove me crazy.  Not a good product.  We had iPads people.  How hard is it to design a decent baby monitor?  When Apple gets into the baby monitor business I'll be their first customer.",1
Clevamama Clevabath Mat and Kneeler,"This mat was perfect for keeping kids from slipping in the tub. It is almost the entire length of the tub, soft for sitting on, suctions well to bottom of tub and has no unusual smell as other mat reviews noted. Kneeler is small and a bit squshy but works fine and was not the priority of this purchase.",5
Dwinguler Eco-friendly Kids Play Mat - Safari Tour (Large),"We purchased this (large) play mat 2 months ago when my baby was 4 month old. It was delivered fast. I like the product right after I opened the box---the color and graphics was beautiful, the foam was supportive and soft, and it didn't have any bad smell. My baby loved playing on it. I felt comfortable lying on it, too. At first I thought it was a bit expensive, but now I think it's totally worth it!",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original - Green, Spirit","I received this carrier and I absolutely love the color, durability and feel. Thanks a million because my little one will get plenty of use from this carrier!!",5
KidCo SecureStick Appliance Lock,"A little bit of background here.  I've got three kids; a four year old, three, and 14 month old.  Baby proofing my house takes a little more effort because I try to get my older two to be more independent.  So baby proofing but accessible.  I've got this step-to-open garbage can that the older two need to get into but not the baby.  As soon as I stuck this on the garbage can the baby ripped it off.  I applied stronger adhesive backing and the baby broke it off! I give this three stars because I should have thought of that.  I believe that this product is good if you have one kid and one kid only or if your older kids need a certain level of security because you'll put it out of reach when on your refrigerator.",3
Squatty Potty 7&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"I bought this after hearing so many people talk about full evacuations. I bought two and gave one to my brother.  This did nothing for me or my brother.  I sat on my thrown and put my feel on this stand and nothing happened. With no slight to the seller because it shipped out fast and packaged great, but this is a waste of money",2
"Naturepedic Waterproof Fitted Crib Pad, 28x52",My 3 1/2 year old daughter sleeps in a queen sized bed. As we try to wean her from pull-ups there are always a few accidents and this cover has not let any moisture through to the mattress.  It was a great buy!,5
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,I purchased this to close a room off from our new labrador puppy. It was simple to install and is easy to install. It is not a super strong gate and could be broken in you push on it too hard but I am happy with the purchase.,4
Evenflo Bounce and Learn Bee Exersaucer,"My daughter is 3.5 months old and can hold her head up on her own.  She loves to be held in a standing position and ""walk"" around.  My husband and I wanted to find a toy that would hold her up, but we have read bad reviews about walkers.  This bouncer is just what we needed.  After quite a bit of research, we picked this one and I am so glad we did. The construction is sturdy and the toys are very engaging.My daughter absolutely LOVES it! Her little legs barely touch the base at the shortest setting, but she happily stands on tippy toes. She loves to bounce and is very interested in the toys.  The lights and sounds might get slightly annoying to some parents, but it entertains her for 30min+ at a time.  We have only had this for a few days, but I am already noticing an improvement in her motivation to grab for toys and she also needs less assistance while trying to sit.  Hopefully she will enjoy this for many more months to come!***Note: we did not buy this from Amazon, as we found the EXACT same thing at Costco for $89.99.  If you are a Costco member, I would see if your local branch carries this.",5
"Summer Infant ComfortMe Wearable Blanket, Little Cars, Small","We were looking for lightweight sleep sacks that had some fabric coverage for our twins' arms. This seems to be the only choice on the market right now, so we gave them a try. (We've been using Halo Sleepsacks.) These are a good lightweight option, but the materials used in these seem a bit cheaper in quality (the zipper, and the general construction) compared with the Halo Sleepsacks. It drives me crazy that the zipper is on the side of the blanket... it's much harder to get on a squirming infant than the center-zip sleep sacks. But it does cover their arms, so that makes me happy.",4
"The First Years 1 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce","it's the only bottle I was able to have my baby drink from...not that he loved it, but at least it's the only one that he actually ate something from...",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"In the midst of all of my bottle testing, I was against Avent, mostly because they do cost a bit more than most bottles.  I thought that I could test a bottle and cup, to see if Avent was really telling the truth when they said all the parts were interchangeable.  Well, they are.  They also have more nipple selections, depending on how fast your child drinks.One thing I wish Avent has was a design or something on the bottle. I did find that if you buy the Evenflo Cool Pals 9 oz. cup holder, these fit in them great.I would suggest only getting 2 packs of these, couple of Magic Cups with handles and some extra spouts (have at least 2 green ones and 1 white one).",5
Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack,"this is the best drying rack.it takes loads of bottles & accessories & it has like a pocket on the top for spoons or other tall accessories.it spins for easy access. great price.i bought other brand that's supposed to be bigger & its more money. but i returned it & got that one, as it didnt hold as much stuff as this one.its made out of plastic, but its sturdy enough to hold loads & loads of baby bottles & accessories.I have it for 6 months & still working very well.I would for sure recommend that product for everyone.",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This playpen is great my granddaughter loves it.  We take it camping with us,and use it at home.  It goes up and down easily and stores easily.  This is a very good playpen.",5
Yo Gabba Gabba Ultra Soft Toddler Blanket,"Product looks great at first, but after my 2yr old started to use it for preschool, the zipper went off its track almost immediately....I guess from the daily use. And the stitching slowly started coming undone. If we got 3months use out of it.... It's an exaggeration.  It felt terrible taking it from my 2yr old. I think he's their biggest fan.",2
Sealy Baby Ultra Rest Mattress,"Picking a mattress is a difficult decision, it is hard to know if one will be the right one,when you look for a mattress for your self you can just lay on them and if they feel right you know, with a crib mattress your baby wont tell you if it feels right, for one they dont know and they cant tell you with words..Most importantly when looking for a crib mattress you want something that is safe (not too soft, or too small) and will hold up until they move on to a big kid bed.We picked/ and like this mattress for a couple reasons:It fits our Crib (Davinci ""Parker"" 4-1)like a glove, no space between.. so its safe. It has a waterproof nonallergic top layers so you don't have to worry about ""fluids"" absorbing and it doesnt make a plastic noise when you push down on it, it was firm enough but still a little soft to comfort baby, also has a 15 year warranty.I have yet to see a bad review for this mattress, and I personally recommend this mattress to my friends.",5
"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea",This cup is impossible for myself and my husband to open! We were only able to use this cup once since it never opened again. I have a friend who is having the same problems with this cup.Also it is not what we were looking for it is to spill proof I was looking for a cup to transition from the playtex straw cups to a regular cup. I wish we had removed the valve before giving it to my daughter.,1
Safety 1st Musical Talkin Potty and Step Stool,I got this for my 20 month old son. When he tries to use it he ends up peeing on the floor. What they call a pee shield doesn't shield! I thought it would be great seeings he like to flush the toilet. Works great for girls though.,1
"Summer Infant 2 Pack Cotton Knit Swaddleme, Safari (Small/Medium)",I have other Summer Infant SwaddleMe's and they are great. These particular ones are too stretchy though and baby breaks out of the swaddle and wakes himself up :(,3
Vilac Set of 56 Alphabet Magnets,"These letters are nice looking, but I was disappointed in the size. They are the same size as the small, cheap plastic magnet letters.  I know I should have paid closer attention to the size details, but I thought the picture made them look bigger. I got them for my 2 year old and I was really hoping for larger letters, especially for the price. The box says not for 0-3.  I do not know about the quality because I have not opened the box since I may return them.  They do come in a nice small wooden box and I like the patterns.",3
Summer Infant Secure Surround Playsafe Playard,"Since all of the puppy play pens appeared to be too low, flimsy, or chewable, I went with a children's babygate instead. Ridiculously easy to set up, open, close, carry with the strap, remove panels, etc. I used mine to make a safe area for my 4 lb dog, who is a jumper and a chewer, and he cannot even come close to jumping out, tipping it over, or chewing through it. And he likes it because he can easily see us through the holes, unlike some solid panel dog playpens.Note - When using only 5 or 4 panels, it is more wobbly than 3 or all 6, hence the 4 stars instead of 5.  Place something on the inside corner, like a doggy crate, or outside corner (place in the corner of a room so the walls are against two sides) to brace it.",4
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"This is GREAT!!! My husband and I LOVE THIS! It's so incredibly east to dispose of the dirty, stinky diapers and the stink is completely trapped. The bag is equally easy to change when ready to dispose of the diapers. It's amazing how that when the smelly diaper goes in, the smell is instantly gone. FABULOUS!",5
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella",Great carseat for grandparents car. Easy to install. Fits nicely in smaller 2 door backseat. Kids like it. Great price!,4
Double Swivel Green 3in1 Bicycle Bike Trailer Baby Stroller Jogger Carrier,"The information on this product states that the front wheel can be locked for jogging or swivel for walking around, that is false.  The front wheel does NOT lock in any shape, form or fashion.  I am very disappointed and would warn anyone that wants to utilize this as a jogging stroller, to look anywhere else.  The front wheel going crazy even when walking at a brisk pace.  I can use it as a bike stroller but I was specifically looking for a double use product and this is not.",1
Phil &amp; TedsSport Buggy Travel Bag,Don't get me wrong. I love the seat and style of the stroller. That's why I bought it but since I've had it I've struggled getting the brake up and down. I feel like I'm realignment it everytime I do it and now I actually use to get down on my hands and knees the yank the brake up. So pissed that I didn't just go with the BOB again! There's breaks are awesome!,1
"The First Years  Deluxe Fold and Go Diapering Kit, Black/Gray",It is very easy to carry and very practical too. I can keep a couple of diapers and other hygiene items inside the bag.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"We purchased the ""Jumperoo"" for our Granddaughter, and she loves it. The seat rotates, it has four height positions. We had to use a pillow at first; her feet didn't quite touch the floor. It is well made. Although it all snaps together, it is not designed to fold and store. You will need about a 3'x3' space for it. Other than that, very entertaining for her.",5
"Kids Line Luxury Security Blanket, Pink","Although my granddaughter likes  the blanket, the blanket is only fuzzy on one side and extremely light weight.  Showed significant lint loss during the first wash.",3
GroVia Wetbag - Vanilla,"When I ordered this I thought I was buying a diaper pail liner. Turns out its a smaller bag. it's too big to be used in my diaper bag but too small to use as a hanging bag.  It works fine as a wet bag but I have no use for a bag this size. I would have returned it had I not been required to pay return shipping, which would have cost as much as the item itself. Overall I am very unsatisfied with this purchase.",2
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","Not what I was looking for. My wife and I wanted something to clean our kid's straws. I saw some lady on amazon mention these as a good option so we picked up a set. I was very disappointed in the quality. I know this was not its intended use and its only a few bucks but I still wish it was a little more sturdy. Anyway, I found something else that I'm a lot happier with. If you want something for your straws get the Sippy Stuff straw brush. If you don't mind switching brushes every now and then get these. They come four in a pack.",3
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink",This is an awesome chair especially for the price.  You aren't getting something cheap and my daughter uses it every day!,5
SoHo Froggies Party Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"This is an okay set. I was a little afraid I order it after reading some of the reviews but for the price I was pleased. A couple of little things you should know... The green looks subdued in the pictures but when you get it, it's really a bright green. And he blue is slightly brighter too. Yes, the bumper is thin, but that's the way they recommend them to be now. I did however have one of the ties fall off as I was tying it to the rail. It didn't unravel or anything and I was able to stitch it back on easily. Like I said, for the price it's okay but don't expect it to last for multiple kids.",4
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,With my first child I took some advice and didn't get a video monitor. People said it would make me check on the baby everytime she stirred. Well after about 6 months I wish I had not taken the advice and had gotten a video monitor because I wanted to see my baby and what she was doing so that I knew whether or not I really needed to go into her room. So with this 2nd baby I decided I would just go ahead and get this video monitor. Now that we have been using this video monitor for two weeks and I LOVE it!!!! We bought an extra camera so that we could have one in each room. The picture is very clear and it is super to switch between cameras. It's so great being able to see what the kids are doing and whether or not they are just stirring in their sleep or if they are really awake without having to go into their rooms and risk them actually waking up.,5
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Bassinet Sheet, Celery",Soft and durableEasy to wash and fit on mattress.  Stayed on the mattress very well. I would buy this again.,4
"I Love My Nana (Pink T-Shirt, size 2T)",I was really looking forward to receiving this.  I was disappointed that it does not seem to stay snapped.  It also stretches out of shape.,2
Booginhead SippiGrip - Blue,We love this! I wish I had bought 2 -- one for home and one to take out with us. The rubber inner grip holds the cup well. Easy to use and saves bending over to pick up the cup again and again.,5
Drinking Cup Spouts (Assorted Colors) 2 Count,I was excited that their was something safe for my new baby.  I'm glad that he is being exposed to less toxins than his big sister.  But they leak like crazy compared to other cups we've used.,3
"Bright Starts My First Cookbook, Pink","My daughter 6 moths old loves this book.  The fun of a book, teething parts to chew on that are easy for her to hold and find, tags to chew, and it is fun to fling around.  Most definitely the BEST of all the fabric book/teether toys we own.",5
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,Love this pump! This is the only pump I use and it is super easy to clean and it gets milk out really fast. I originally got it from the hospital where my daughter was born and I've been using it since. I just ordered another one so that I can alternate when one is dirty.,5
Safety 1st Soothing Mist Ultrasonic Humidifier,"I've owned this humidifier for a little over a year now, and it's never let me down.  The product description is a little lackluster though.  I wouldn't use this in a room that's over 500 sq ft.  It worked great in my bedroom last winter, but I have an open floor studio apartment now (around 7-750 sq ft) and it's just not enough.  Even with refilling it twice a day and having it run 24/7 the humidity level in the air has never been above 40% (and that was on a warm, rainy day).Very quiet operation, when turned up all the way the most you will hear is a slight ""trickling"" noise from the ultrasonic waves splashing the water around.Make sure the surface you put it on is level.  Even a slight bit off can cause it to leak water.In the past I've needed to buy on average a new humidifier each winter because they're always cheap and crap out, not so with this one. Overall the merits of this humidifier vastly out weigh my complaints.",4
"Carters 2 Pack Keep Me Dry Quilted Crib Pad, White","They are made of a very good fabric, but kind of small.I thought it was for cribs, but it's more for basinets or changing tables.It works good for small babies.",3
"Moby Wrap MLB Edition Baby Carrier, SF Giants","I love this Moby Wrap! I also have an ERGObaby carrier and this is an excellent additional option to use with my 6 month old. I refuse to put her in any type of carrier where her legs dangle straight down (like a Baby Bjorn) and this wrap fits the bill perfectly! When you take the wrap out of the package, it may seem overwhelming because of the amount of fabric, but in all honesty it's really easy to use. The wrap comes with a photo booklet that shows you how to do all the different wraps. This wrap is also incredibly comfortable! I highly recommend it to all mothers! Go Braves!",5
Baby Gear 2 Piece Blanket Set Giraffe (Blanket + Security Blanket),"My one year old loooove this giraffe so so much, he can't sleep without this! I lost his first one ( babyshower gift) when we were at Target and boy, that night I can tell he can't sleep. I looked all over and it's only available at amazon. Quite expensive but I jhave to buy it.  I am just glad they have it, coz if the baby can't sleep, mommy can't sleep too. He had this since he was born. And we always take this everywhere we go. For some reason this thing comfort him. When he's crying he will look for his giraffe and he will snuggle it... It's cute . I will buy another one. hopefully they will lower the prcie :)",5
"Jumping Beans&reg; Butterfly Hooded Bath Towel, in Pink","Love it, the only negitive is that it took about 4 washings to stop the little pink fuzzies fromngetting  everywhere.",4
Pacifier - Wubbanub Infant Plush Pacifier - Turtle,"Slides off my 3 month old a little easier than the frog, but it's still an awesome product.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat.  Survives the washing machine very well.",5
Peg perego Primo Viaggio SIP Convertible Car Seat Cacao,This is a bit pricey so at first i was hesitant in purchasing since I had not been able to see it in person since not many places carry this seat just online. I happened to find a place in San Antonio on our to el paso (8 hr road trip) it too me less than second to decide to buy after seeing the quality!!! It's so comfy. My other car seat was the britax boulevard which is still in $300 price range but I wish I would have never spent my time or money on that one since this exceeds all expectations. I ended uP purchasing 2!!! One for the other car we have. I recommend this seat to anyone and everyone-: don't give the price a second thought since you will be using it for at least until your child hits 70 pounds!! Well worth the investment and my daughter loves it more. I no longer hear her complain about being in her car seat!!,5
Bamboobies Super-Soft Washable Nursing Pads - All Pale Pink,"I am a new mom and these work perfect for me!  I don't leak a lot so I decided to get some washable nursing pads.  My friend recommended these for me (and she leaks a lot!). They do slide around sometimes and can get bunchy looking if you don't position them right, but these are very minor problems compared to spending money every month on disposable ones.  Over all, I am very happy with my purchase.",4
"Honeysuckle Breast Milk Storage Bags, 75 Ct (3 Boxes of 25 pcs)","I really like these bags. They're super durable, but thick and pliable. I bought the 50 pack to try when my baby was first born. I got through the first 25 and loved them. But after about the 5th bag in my second set of 25 they began to leak badly at the bottom. I had pumped 4 oz and put it in the bag, as usual, and it began to drip. My hubby quickly got out another bag and we transferred the milk and that one also began leaking. We poured the milk into the bottle because obviously it wasn't a one time deal. I put water in 4 more bags and realized they were ALL leaking. I looked in my freezer to make sure they hadn't leaked without me knowing it and there didn't seem to be an issue. I called the company and made them aware and asked them if they could replace the bags. They were VERY nice, took my address, phone number, and said they'd send me 100 new bags and to return the leaking bags so they could examine them. Sweet! Well, that was 7 or 8 weeks ago and I haven't seen or heard anything and have never received new bags. So, Lansinoh bags are my new friend. They're similar enough, but I'm bummed because I really did want to LOVE Honkeysuckle.Update 11/25I received my replacement bags, but they leaked on me again. This time I'm not even going to bother calling for replacements. I lost over 2 oz of precious milk in a cup of warm water when defrosting. I was pretty mad.",2
Cloud b Sleep Sheep On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds,"My daughter sleeps with a sound machine in her nursery.  When on the go, she loves her crib and the Sleep Sheep allows her to feel like she is in her crib.  It has great volume control and helps her to fall asleep and STAY SLEEPING since the sounds help to null out any sudden noises- like her brother yelling in the stroller next to her!  I bring the Sleep Sheep everywhere and tell all my mommy friends to invest in one.",5
North States Supergate Pressure Mount Clear Choice Wood Gate,Ferrets are super climbers sometimes. This gate is perfect to keep them confined during their out of cage time. It is short enough to step over easily though. I have purchased two of these because they are so great!,5
Skip Hop Backpack WITH Lunchie (Zebra),"Very cute product, and versatile.  I like how the lunchie has a clip on the handle, it clips onto the stroller nicely.  Roomy enough for 1-2 meals for my todder plus an ice pack.  The backpack is fine, seems sturdily constructed.  The panda is quite adorable!",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"This is a very simple yet affective baby monitor. No setup required. Just place the camera in a spot you want and turn on the monitor. The picture is very good. The plastic belt hook feels a bit cheap, but I usually have it just sitting on the counter or nightstand so that doesn't bother me.",5
"Boon Frog Pod Bath Toy Scoop,Green","I adore this boon product! I love that is provides convenient storage for all of the bath-time essentials and it is cute and sturdy! It stays put and my son loves looking at it during bath-time. I even hang wash clothes on  the &#34;hands&#34; to dry out before throwing them in the dirty clothes. The little soap bottle shelf is perfect too! I love that it isnt a little mesh-net and that it doesnt have suction-cups to stay in place (bc those NEVER work). One piece of advice though...if you bathe your child in a garden tub or something other than a typical bath tub, make sure you have enough wall-space to hang this guy. He is pretty long and wide and he needs a decent sized wall to hang to. Just keep this in-mind!",4
Belvah Large Quilted Polka Dot 3pc Diaper Bag (Black/ Multi),"Received this as a baby shower gift, I have a two year old and a new born and everything I need for them fits neatly inside (5 size 1 diapers, 3 size 3 diapers, a blanket, and a outfit for my newborn).",4
"Kushies Deluxe Flannel Change Pad, Yellow with Brown Dots","We have one in the diaper bag, one in the living room, and one in the bedroom. Two extras for when they're in the laundry. Wash up well and are easy to throw into a bag for use on public changing tables.",5
Eddie Bauer Fold and View Mirror,"Edited 6 mo later:  Now that I've gotten used to it, I like it OK.  It is small, which is good and I find that most of the time, I just need to check her face anyway.  If I need a better view, I use my visor mirror.  I still don't highly recommend it, but it's not so bad.Pros:  It attaches to the rear view mirror easily and isn't bulky.  The fit on the rear view mirror is adjustable for different sized mirrors and is a tight, secure fit.Cons:The mirror is too small and not clear enough.  Only gives enough view to see the face of my toddler and it isn't a clear view at that; looks distorted.Vibrations from the car cause the mirror to constantly vibrate.Gets in the way when using the passenger visor.  Knocks it out of whack, which requires it to be readjusted.I would not buy this again.  I got it on sale and still feel that way.",2
"Innobaby Glass Rectangle Food Storage Container, 2 Pack, Yellow/Green","It Was bought originally for my daughter as a lunch box. The quality looks good,But I did not expect it is too small, It is Poker card size. Now I have to buy another bigger one.",4
Baby Chef Ultimate Baby Food Maker,"i should preface this by saying that in order to make baby food, you don't actually ""need"" a baby food maker.  i was from the school that believed that i could do it with what i already had and take up less counter space.  i used a pot and steaming basket to steam (shock) and a cuisinart to process.  it was fine.HOWEVER...i bought this product bc we are going away and i dont anticipate use of a stove.  i should have bought it ages ago!  it makes things so easy -- the same unit for both steam and puree, and it CLEANS SO EASY!!overall i love it, i spent the weekend stocking up; i was that excited about it!PROS:easy to use- so easy it motivates you to make more food!easy to cleanevidently warms bottles.  i didn't use this function, but if i had known, perhaps i would have ditched the bottle warmer in the early months.PRICE!  about HALF the price of other baby food makers, if you use one go for this one!CONS: (but i weigh these a lot less than the PROS!!!)a little large.  all the baby food processors are, and this isn't any different.the storage bin underneath could be a little larger to hold one of the extra caps...you'll know what i mean when you see it.there could be a deeper well to catch the water from the outer steaming topOVERALL:BUY THIS.  i'm so glad i did!",5
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,"I love the pattern on this.  I haven't used it, but I know it will cover me when I breast feed.  The material is good quality too.",5
Mia Rose Canvas Wall Art (Set of 3),I received this product promptly and it was well worth the price.  It looks wonderful in the baby's room.  I would recommend this product.,5
Sesame Street Elmo Car Seat Cover,"My daughter loves Elmo but when I received the carseat cover it was Dora, even my order slip had Elmo on it. I wrote to the sellers but they never responded back or tried to contact me. So I'm a little disappointed with the purchase but the cover does its job.",2
"Lorex BB2411 2.4&quot; Sweet Peek Video Baby Monitor with IR Night Vision and Zoom, White",This is the first video monitor we have bought. The picture quality is good and clear. It was easy to set up and it is easy to use at night. I like that you can set up the volume in the baby's room that will trigger the video monitor to go on. The one thing I don't like is the lullabies...The noise they make seems to trigger the video monitor to come on...I don't want to listen to the lullabies so we rarely use that feature.,5
Kolcraft Pure Sleep Therapeutic 150 Crib Mattress,Found the product to be matching its description. My Baby boy sleeps good on this mattress. Couldn't be happier to find this as its in budget and works pretty good for my boy. Would definitely recommend.,5
Kushies Washable Pre-fold Diapers - Assorted,Much nicer then expected. Plan to use them as burp cloths for the grand babies. Was planning to use to make designer burp cloths when I ordered. But they are so nice I plan to use them as is.,5
"Carter's Easy Fit Printed Crib Fitted Sheet, Animal","This fits a crib mattress just fineIt&#8217;s a typical fitted bed sheetIt&#8217;s a stylish cover that comes from a fashionable lineOf little froggies that&#8217;s really neatI like this cover as it fits perfectly, does the job, is a little thin, but no complaints.",4
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","When I started pumping I thought I would not be able to make it for a long time. My hands got numb keeping the funnels against my breast, and I had tons of spills. Then I searched for a solution and found this bra. I thought it was kind of pricy but now I think this has been a great investment. I have a 5 months old baby and I am a working mom. Thanks to this product and a great breast pump (if you are really into it you need to have a good pump as well) I am still breastfeeding and it is not painful anymore. I read news in my phone or use the computer while pumping. So, if you are a multitasking mom that is really into breastfeeding, a great pump and this bra is all that you need",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,We first purchased one of those potty seats that has elmo on it thinking it would help motivate my son to want to sit on it.  It didn't fit our toilet seat and moved around a lot so my son wanted nothing to do with it.  I found this Babybjorn seat and it was a life saver.  It expands to fit any size toilet and it doesn't move.  After we purchased the first one we immediately went back and bought a second one for our other bathroom.,5
Inclined to Sleep,"What would we have done without this??  We have a corner crib, so mattress lifters didn't fit.  This was PERFECT!  It kept our little one in an inclined position all night so that we did not have any sleeping difficulties.  We went from awake every two hours cleaning up spit up, to sleeping for 4 to 5 hours at a time.  What a blessing!",5
"NUK Gerber Graduates 100% Silicone Platemat, 10 x 15",Great idea.  Folds up nicely in the diaper bag to take with us.  Nice to have something clean on the restraunt table that she's eating off of.  It is made of silicone but I wish it stuck to the table a little better.,4
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","We have used two Summer Infant monitors and this Motorola. We feel strongly that Summer Infant is far better. This one looks more high tech and it does have the option of a camera that moves and intercom feature. However, what it lacks in other features and overall quality makes those features seem like small potatoes. First of all, the video feed is choppy at best. If you wave your hand in front of the monitor you will see it freeze about every two seconds. That's how the video feed is ALWAYS. I don't like that. With the Summer Infant I could literally watch my daughter's chest rise and fall because it was a smooth, real time, continuous video. This is not true of Motorola. Beyond this, the monitor buttons are awful and not designed for use in the dark. On the Summer Infant one, when the screen goes black there is a large button on top of the monitor that you just push and the picture returns. Think snooze button on the alarm clock big -- easy to find and hit in the dark. The Motoroloa button is a tiny button second from the bottom on the right. Yeah -- not helpful at all. Beyond this, the darn thing beeps when the battery is getting low. Obviously Motorola engineers did not consider the fact that for several months or longer many babies sleep in their parents' room and when baby is fussing or making noise it's nice to look at the monitor instead of getting up and going over to stand by the crib, possibly waking the baby with a creaky floor board or rustling around. The beeping wakes the baby! It also beeps randomly for some other reason which I will have to refer to the manual to figure out. It has a green light that flashes next to the on light when this beeping is going on. The screen is super bright too which is bad for having a baby in the room since the light illuminats the room and also shocks your eyes when you first turn it on. Last but not least, it interferes with both our Wifi and our other baby monitor that sits next to it. It's just not a smart design overall. I shoud have heeded other reviews about the lack of thought the engineers put into the design.I wish we had opened this monitor and used it for a few nights before our second daughter arrived. We would have returned it within the allowable time and bought another Summer Infant one. We were drawn in by the moving camera and two way talk features but I'd gladly give those up for a monitor that is intuitive and just works better.",2

"Preggie Drops,Natural Green Apple 21 Ct From Three Lollies","Let's face it- when you're in your 1st trimester, you just feel crappy.  These drops taste good and do provide some nausea relief.  They are on the sour side, which I love, but some may not.  I prefer drops in general because the lollipops can look a little weird and juvenile in a work/office environment.  If nothing else, they give you something sweet to distract your taste buds, even when you're hungry but really don't feel like eating.",4
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot","My daughter was ALWAYS losing her pacifiers once her old pacifier holder got all gross and worn out and had to be thrown out.Bought this one, clamps right on, even when she throws her tantrums and tries with all her force to rip it off, she has only ripped it off once.This is a must have if you're always having to buy more pacifiers because all the others get lost or disappear. Have not lost a binkie ever since I bought this, a must have.",5

"JL Childress Crib Mobile Attachment Clamp, White",This arm for a crib mobile is absolutely useless!  It's so short that the mobile hangs down on top of the baby!  I should have read the reviews before buying.  Do not waste your money!  It will only work if your mobile hangs down an inch or two.  Who designed this?  I'm returning it immediately.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,1
"Baby K'tan Baby Carrier, Black, X-Large",Purchased for traveling by myself with baby and needed an easy to use carrier that would help me brought the airports. So glad I went with this product. It was so easy to use and my 3 month old loved it. He could enjoy time out of his stroller while I remained hands free. He likes is so much that he often falls asleep in it. I keep it in the car and take it with me everywhere.,5
"UPPAbaby Vista Stroller, Cole/Slate","I absolutely LOVE this stroller! I originally wanted a Quinny (after seeing them all over Ireland) and then loved the Bugaboo. After doing tons and tons of research on strollers I narrowed it down to the Bugaboo and the UppaBaby.Every store I found only had one or two types of nice strollers. I finally found a store near Baltimore (Babies First in Columbia, MD) that has TONS of high-end strollers that you can test and compare. The UppaBaby Vista seemed sturdier than the Bugaboo, looked better and had WAY more storage underneath. That bag-thing that Bugaboo has looks really small! This storage is HUGE! I always carry around my huge purse, the diaper bag, and I usually end up stuffing in our coats, scarves, a blanket, shopping bags, water bottles, etc... it holds everything!Overall, I liked it much better once I saw them together! And Bonus: it was a LOT cheaper!! The ONLY difference I could find was that the Bugaboo's handle could flip/ switch directions rather than just lifting and changing the seat. It is SO easy to just un-click the UppaBaby seat and switch directions (so baby can face you) that it didn't even matter to me about the handle.UppaBaby is compatible with my Peg Perego Primo Viaggio car seat, you can add on their ""Rumble seat"" for an additional child, you can add on the ""Piggyback board"" for an older child, and you can buy tons of other accessories for it if you wish (like the awesome cup holder!).My baby is now almost 3 months old and I still love the stroller! It easily folds and fits in our SUV trunk, I've taken it on a 5k run/ walk, it it super easy to maneuver with one hand, and the fold-up cup holder is very handy!Although I had big plans to use it, I've only used the bassinet part once. Maybe because I am just too paranoid and I want him strapped in to his car seat though. I just wish the bassinet could stand up on its own on the ground (rather than collapsing) -but I guess that would defeat its purpose.If you are worried about price- you can buy accessories on eBay. Our dumb cat pooped in the toddler seat before our baby was even born so I freaked out and bought a new fabric set on eBay. I also had it dry cleaned and it turned out just fine! Thats an option if you have a major mess in the future.Also- the Peg Perego adaptor pegs are a bit tricky to line up sometimes, but I still like it just fine.The original color I loved was Miles Blue (turquoise) but it was only available in the 2010 model. Since I wanted a 2011, I have Cole Blue and it is beautiful!Overall- I am extremely happy with my stroller choice and I wouldn't go back on my decision!!! LOVE IT!",5
Fresh N Freeze 2 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 12-Pack,"I am on round 2 of using these containers. The size is perfect. Don't fill them over the 2oz line though...or the expansion could damage them. The stacking isn't perfect, but I love the screw caps.",4

"LA Baby Countour Changing Pad 30&quot;, White","Most of the changing table pads are longer to fit the tables at Baby'r us, etc.  When we purchased an IKEA changing table we had to look for an alternative.

BabyBjorn Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Red,"We've tried SO many bibs with our one year daughter.

"Baby Trend Diaper Champ Deluxe, Blue","The old one worked great!. We steered many people to using the odl Diaper Champ. We gave many as baby shower gifts. When we had our last child we thought we would buy the new model. It was horrible. It did not seal as well as the old one so unless you took great care to leave it perfectly aligned it would smell horribly. Also, taking loaded bags out of the new model was hard. It would snag on some of the innards sometimes ripping bags.If you can find the old model... I would buy that. I tried to tell Baby Trend about the issues with the new model... but they did not care. I used to love Baby Trend, however after my experience with their customer service regarding this model.... I have sworn them off. In fact I did not want to steer any traffic to them. However, if you can find the original designed model... I would try that. It worked GREAT for us and many many of our family/friends.",1

"Graco FastAction Fold Sport Stroller Click Connect Stroller, Gotham",I really like this stroller for several key reasons.1.  Heavy duty support of up to 50 pounds2.  Folds up reasonably small for bigger sized stroller3.  Front wheel system makes it MUCH easier to navigate a crowded area without running over toes!,5
"Edushape 4 Pack Sensory Ball Mega Pack, Colors May Vary","My son found these balls at a friends house.  I had to get them immediately!  The pack comes with two opaque, two translucent and one each small, the others big.  My son can palm the small balls, which make it fun for throwing.  The bigger ones make him use two hands to pick up and throw. Even the nubs on these are different (opaque to translucent), which makes the texture/weight/etc different and SENSORY!  He'll be playing with these for a while!",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"After extensive research,I purchased this stroller to replace my bulky travel system for a trip to the Bahamas.  Upon receiving it, I was extremely pleased with the chic appearance, and ease of assembly.  The basket underneath, parent caddy, and higher handles made it really stand out in my opinion, especially for the price!But this is what really proved the stroller's worth in my eyes.  The morning of my trip, the stroller accidentally got RUN OVER...BY AN SUV...and dragged down the driveway.  And the only damage was a rear wheel came off partway, a small hole in the parent caddy, and some scratches in the paint.  The frame was fully intact...not even bent.  The stroller made it through the entire trip, and held up just fine.  If you're looking for GREAT quality at a GREAT price, this is your stroller!",5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn",Overall it is a good swaddle but as my dd moves around the swaddle pieces can get bunched up by her face.  When I check in on her I have to pull the cloth down.  Also the velcro is loud when you are trying to discretely adjust the swaddle.,3

"Britax Pavilion 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx",so easy to get kids into.  You can tell the quality just by the rubber on the bottom that goes on your vehicles seat.,5
Bugaboo Frog Stroller - Blue,"For many years the hype in Hollywood has been the strange looking Bugaboo strollers. So for the features we bought one..The Good: As a  petite woman I especially appreciate the inclusion of short handles on a stroller. The Bugaboo Frog does have perfectly placed handles where height is concerned. I have no problem reaching the handles and pushing my child around. I also get a thrill out of the ""one hand turn"" that the Frog allows you to accomplish. I find that my son seems comfortable in the Frog longer than his other strollers. I have a Fisher Price knock-off that he can easily get his way out of. He does tend to hate strollers, though. The navy blue color is especially aesthetically pleasing, as is the off white quilted-like design of the hood's interior. I have no experience with any shock to the stroller, but from what I have been told Bugaboo's can take a real beating. The stroller also drives extra smooth.The Bad: I cringe each time that I have to fold the Frog up and place it into the car. The tutorial video at Bugaboo's website shows the model taking it apart completely, piece by piece. I have no time for that. Taking the seat portion off requires two people, usually. I have bad joints and squeezing the white buttons on the side will not work for me.Unfolding the frame is even more hard. The frame has the tendency to make itself turn backwards. It also locks up and creates a major pain for those trying to fold it. Bugaboo really should fix this design flaw.",4
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue),"Anyone who has a baby knows how awful the bulb sucker you get at the hospital is. The baby screams and produces more snot than it sucks. This is a miracle, my baby actually laughs when I use it. After I got over the gross factor of sucking snot put with my mouth (the tissue is a great filter and I don't have to buy a separate filter) this cold and flu season won't be nearly so bad since I won't have a baby who's nose is constantly dripping and stuffed.",4

"Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue","This was great when I was timing my contractions, but wasn't as useful as I thought it would be once the baby came.

It would be cool if it could keep some kind of stats...",3

Summer Infant Plush n' Pink Single Bedrail,I bought this for my 4 year old. She absolutely loves it and thinks it makes her room even prettier. We have it set up so that there is a little room at the front of her mattress and a little room at the end so she can get into bed either way. The coverage is great. It is taller than our old one which I am ok with. The cover is soft and it is great that you can take it off to wash it. I couldn't do that with our old one. So far it is working great and haven't had any problems.,5
"Athena Daphne Convertible Crib and Changer, Cherry","This crib was designed to be used for several years as it moves from crib to toddler bed and possibly back to crib again for a 2nd child.  However, if you contact the manufacturer to ask for another copy of the instructions for this crib, they will tell you no.  I sent several emails and even included a photograph of the serial number sticker on the crib, and the company that makes this, AFG, refused to provide me with another copy of the instructions.  They were very rude and unhelpful.  If you want your crib to last a few years, and there is any chance that you might lose the original instructions, I would recommend getting a different crib from a different company.",1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","This was recommended to me by my sister who had her baby over a year ago. She didn't discover this until months after having her baby and wished she had had it all along.I am a large breasted woman and my nipples are quite sensitive so the first time messing with this was challenging. It is great because you can adjust it in several ways to fit better, but I just didn't get the feeling of support and lining up my nipples with the pump pieces was difficult.For me, works best over a nursing bra so I have the support I need and it makes centering the plastic piece easier. So there is less pain and I feel like it sits well so I can do hands free. Now I can read, surf the Internet, eat etc all while pumping. So much faster than one at a time - although that is still an option if you are just feeding off one breast and pumping the other.A definite must have if you will be pumping a lot! I plan on taking with me to work so I can knock it out faster there as well.",4
Fisher-Price Adorable Animals Baby's Bouncer,"After trying a few different chairs for a newborn, this chair was the least expensive and also the favorite one!I like the feature, that the bar with the animals is removable.

"ERGObaby Organic Baby Carrier, Desert Bloom","Amazon sent me a FAKE ERGO which I carried my baby around in for 5 months. Amazon is well aware that they are using suppliers from companies who stock counterfeit carriers and yet they are denying me a full refund, instead giving me a ""Gift card"". I do not want a gift card as I want to purchase an ergo from a authorized retailer. I used my amazon credit card to purchase a true ergo from babies r us and they are still refusing to apply the gift card they gave us to pay the balance on the credit card. We've been on the phone now for over 2 hours trying to just use the gift card to pay our amazon credit card balance.Amazon is lucky my baby wasn't injured and they don't have a bigger problem on their hands.",1

Summer Infant Dr. Mom Gentle Vibrations Toothbrush,"I purchased this brush for my 16month old because she was always fascinated with my electric toothbrush. Looking for something without a Disney character on it brought me to this item. Unlike another reviewer, I think the vibrating action is just right for my daughter.Unfortunately the bayonet locking mechanism that is supposed to hold the brush head on the vibrating body is very flimsy and has, within 2 days of use, been almost completely whittled away by my daughter not only brushing, but also gnawing on the head, trying to brush other things and pushing down hard, etc.It still holds, and I haven't tried one of the other heads on it yet, but I would strongly advise the manufacturer to improve the connection point. The plastic used seems to delicate for a toddler's use. AND: once the nib on the vibrating body is gone, the heads will not stay on. There go the replacement heads...I have still recommended this product to others as it has turned my daughter from a toothbrush hater to a toothbrush lover",4
"Safety 1st onBoard 35 Infant Car Seat, Triton","I was a little skeptical at first about this carseat because it wasn't one of the popular brands that I saw everyone else using, but I was able to get this seat for such a great deal I couldn't turn it down.  We love this carseat so far!  Our newborn ended up being premature and this seat was able to fit her even when she was 5 lbs.  Only complaint is that it is hard to find car seat adaptors for strollers for this brand.  We purchased a baby jogger city mini stroller which we love and were able to use this seat with the adjustable belly bar as other reviewers recommended.  I preferred to have a good jogging stroller compared to a combination stroller/carseat set.",4
"Infantino Musical Push and Pull Toy, Giraffe","I agree with the other reviews here -- this is a completely charming pull toy, adorable (the colors are actually richer than the photo shows) with a wonderful little music box-style lullaby. It's true that the string is too short for my 16-month-old to pull around while she walks, but she loves it anyway. She'll actually pick it up and hug it like any other stuffed animal she has.  I love hearing the song over and over -- in fact, I got to this page because I was trying to find out if it's an actual song.",5
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"My husband installed these on every piece of furniture that could tip in our house. It took him about an afternoon, but we have a lot of furniture.

"Carters Quilted Woven Playard Fitted Sheet, Animal","Very soft, fits in the play yard great.  Not too much extra material so it's not loose, which has been a problem in the past.  Cute design.",4
"Foundations Trio Triple Tandem Stroller, Blue","We immediately took the stroller out of the box and and of course the 11 year old wanted to play with the box.  When we finally wanted to put the babies into the triple stroller the center restraint straps were cut in half.  It looked like they were cut with a box cutter.  Since the box was no longer intact we did not attempt to send back.We did figure out our own work around, however when you invest this kind of money you expect it to be in appropriate order.My advise - examine it as soon as you pull it out of the box.This product does make life a whole lot easier for my daughter who is adopting a set of twins and their brother who is 11 mo older.  going to the Dr. office was an  ordeal with all of them the car seats are so heavy.",3
Evenflo ExerSaucer Mega - Farmyard,"At first, I was skeptical about purchasing this product.  I heard so many negative things about it not being good for a child's development.  However, I'm glad I changed my mind and bought it.  My girls really enjoy playing with the toy.  They're getting a workout without realizing.The only drawback is the assembly.  There are a million pieces.  They should have made this process easier.  Parents just don't have the time for such a thing.  Set aside several hours.",3

Baby Photo Album Record-A-Message,"My mother gave us this book after our son was born.  We enjoyed filling it up with pictures, which we did pretty quickly.  One of our favorite first pictures was a picture of my husband holding our son in the hospital bed across from me.  I woke up and saw he was asleep and cradling our son in his arms after being awake for our 26 hours of labor and delivery.  It's one of our favorite first pictures.  We were able to record the sweet little baby cry for our son too a few days later at home.  It was nice to be able to preserve that through this photo album.  This album is a great gift for new parents and a great way to preserve special memories through the voice recording and also through your favorite pictures.  Today, there are so many different kinds of technology available to video/record for memories too.  At the same time, it's special to have something you can look back on and actually hold in your hands.  Our son loves to look back through his baby book and hear his cry when he was so little.  It means a lot to him also to have something he can hold in his hands and look through.  That's something more modern technology doesn't always provide that's priceless.",5

If not, milk starts dripping on my skin. I wish the bra was deigned so that it can overcome that.",4
Battat Sound Puzzle Box,Haven't met a kid that doesn't love this.  It's a great starter shape sorter for kids and has a softer sound which is less scary for kids who have sensory issues.,5
Baby Trend Galaxy Flex-Loc Infant Car Seat,"I've been using this seat since my 8 month old was born and can't stand it.  He's small so he's still got a few pounds to go until we move him to a bigger seat.  I can't wait!  The handle gets stuck on the sunshade every time you move it up or down.  The handle release is akward and very hard to squeeze.  The buckle is also very akward to get buckled especially with a squirmy baby (although I suppose any seat is hard to buckle when they're squirming).  You have to fit together two small pieces and get them simultaneously clipped into the buckle.  It's not easy.  The only pros...I do like the triangular handle, it gives you many carrying options, nice fabric, and the built in level.  Also it has gotten good safety reviews.  In retrospect, we should've gone with the Graco Snugride.  Easier to use, a little cheaper, and got equal or better saftey ratings.  If we decide to have another baby, we definitely won't be using this seat.",2
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","The seam of the pillowcase at the neck part of the pillow cuts into my shoulder quite a bit. I cut the seam off and put a pillow case over the top, which solved that problem, but left the pillowcase underneath ripping every time I turned over. I think the idea is great but the design needs A LOT of work around the head area. Besides the now ripping pillowcase, I love this pillow. It supports my back and belly and prevents me from rolling onto my back accidentally in my sleep. This pillow will work if you cut off the top part of the case and keep the case covering only the sides. Then cut a regular pillowcase so it's open on both ends and slip it over the pillow to the top. Since you have to do this to the pillow I do not think it is worth $60.",3

"Fisher-Price Precious Planet Portable High Chair Cover, Blue","This highchair cover is great - covers all the gross parts of restaurant highchairs so I don't have to worry about wiping the chair down with wipes.  Not that bulky, and easy to clean.  The loops on the front for attaching toys are great too.  My only negative comment is that the slits for the highchair straps are a little too small, and it is sometimes difficult to get the clips on the straps through.",4

Fisher-price - Made By Me - Mess Free Finger Paints,"The concept is wonderful...especially for my daughter with special needs.

"The First Years Compass B540 Booster Seat, Abstract O's","I spent a lot of time researching different car seats before I settled on this one. This seat has almost all of the features I was looking for. The only thing it didn't have was LATCH which I found to be unnecessary anyway. One of the most important factors contributing to its high rating is the comfort level. My daughter (who is 5) tried out many seats, and this one is by far the most padded. A lot of the other seats she tried just had a thick layer of fabric, whereas this one actually feels soft and cushy. She has spent 2 hours in it on several different occasions with no complaints. I also love that the armrests fold up if needed, it makes it really easy for her to buckle herself up. It also sits very securely in my car. It leaves me feeling that my daughter is safe when she is in it, and you really couldn't ask for much else. When I first saw the picture of it I was a little wary. The pattern seemed a little too busy for my taste. But, since it had everything else I wanted I decided to give it a try. I am very pleased to say that it looks a lot better in person. I couldn't be more happier with this car seat.",5

Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,"At 4 months my son developed a love/hate relationship with our velcro swaddle blankets and miracle blankets. He wanted/needed to be swaddled in order to fall asleep but he'd consistently wake up 30 or 40 minutes into his naps and get super frustrated that he couldn't move his arms so he would fight until he busted out of the swaddle (at this time we were also trying to transition him into his crib from the Rock and Play and I think being flat in the crib would give him more leverage to break out). His arms would flail and/or he'd get cold and he wouldn't be able to get himself back to sleep. We tried swaddling with one arm out to slowly wean him from the swaddle but he was sleeping terribly. We tried sleep sacks but I don't think he felt secure enough to be able to fall asleep, or if he did, his naps were just as short.I read about the Magic Sleepsuit and decided to give it a try. We saw improvements from the first time he wore it. By the second day his naps were back to being two hours (I can time when he'll wake down to the minute!) and his night sleep has improved as well. We finally have him sleeping in his crib and we're on a consistent schedule. I'm already dreading having to wean him off the suit but I guess we'll cross that bridge when we get to it.Also, from the other reviews I was concerned about it being too hot going into summer but so far I've found it to be very breathable and have been able to regulate his temp based on what we dress him in under the suit.",5

"Dream On Me Elora Collection Toddler Bed, Cherry","I was very pleased with this toddler bed. For starters, all of the reviews about how difficult this thing is to put together are TRUE! This thing is a complete NIGHTMARE! But with that being said, it can be done and is not impossible. When I received my bed, all parts were there and in good condition. A little dusty and slightly scratched, but still fine. Some of the pieces I felt did not fit properly, but I went ahead and used then without altering them and the bed turned out completely fine. And for the lady who said she could lay on the bed, TOTALLY TRUE! This is a cheap but sturdy bed. Me and my husband wanted to see if it would hold our weight, so  for 3 minutes, this bed held myself (130lb) husband (180lb) baby (32lb). We were all laying down and had no problems, however I did not want to push it so after a few minutes I got off and let them finish story time without me. In the end, I am super happy with my purchase. Very very cheap, good and sturdy quality.",4
Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor with Temperature Sensor and Night Mode,"So far I've been impressed! We have a large home and I'm happy that I get clear reception from the basement all the way to the second floor. LOVE the talk feature, that I can let our child know that I'm on my way. Also nice to know the temp in the room! Very pleased to far!",5

"GroVia Organic Cloth AIO Diaper, Vanilla",Looove how it fit on my 32lbs 38inches tall guy. It look so trim under his jeans like he was wearing a disposable diaper and it can hold a lot of pee. It washed well (my son never does his #2 in the diaper so I don't know about the staining issues)and dried fast in one drier. No red mark ever. I would like to have more of these diapers,5
Britax B-Ready Lower Infant Car Seat Adapter,I bought this for my britax chaperone car seat.. So I can put my newborn on the bottom of my b-ready stroller.. I love it! It's so easy to interchange !! Def would recommend to a friend,5
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","This is a very durable stroller, easy to assemble and very intuitively designed (Britax must have asked a lot of moms in focus groups what they liked about strollers!).  My only criticism is that for the $400 price tag, I think Britax should include the second stroller seat for free instead of charging another $120.This highly adaptable stroller is designed to be configured 14 different configurations. The stroller can handle one child or two, but you have to buy additional accesories to hold two.  The top seat is for babies of at least 6 months old and up to 55 lbs.The under-seat storage basket allows ample space for diapers, baby needs or shopping bags, and you can buy an extra storage device which attaches on to the stroller (not really needed, plenty of storage here!).This stroller is also in-line double stroller with the BRITAX B-READY Second Seat (sold separately for around $120). The Second Seat is appropriate for newborns up to 35 pounds. The stroller can fits an infant car seat with top seat, infant seat with second seat, top seat with second seat, and even second seat with bassinet. It also fits two infant car seats-great if you have twins!The stroller even has a four-point suspension! There are foam-filled rubber tires which helps provide a smooth ride (best I have seen so far). The stroller's adjustable handlebar and grip is comfortable and is at a good angle for pushing. The stroller even has a soft head pad and a retractable sun canopy with a vent window.It's easy to fold this stroller.  The stroller folds with both the top and second seat in place. The single-step brake is very use to use.  There is a clear red/green indicator which allows you to easily lock and unlock both rear wheels with one foot.There is also a large, under-seat storage basket accessible from all sides. The adult cup holder is conveniently located on the side of the frame.  This stroller seems to have all the little details covered.I have owned some high quality strollers, but this stroller is the sturdiest, most intuitive, well ""thought out,"" and adaptable transport system I have used.  I just wish Britax would add the second seat into the package without any additional charge.",5
Munchkin Travelware Disposable Bibs - 24 Pack,"Honestly, thought I would use these while going out to restaurants but they're more of a nuisance than anything.Convenient for sure (when you have time to plan) but just not practical in a working parents world.",2
Infantino Swift Classic Carrier Black,"I purchased a moby for baby wearing but after trying that, it seemed easier to invest in a simple carrier.  This one does the trick for very little investment.  My baby is just over 13lbs and is 6 weeks old, I anticipate being able to use this for a few months.With any backpack, the weight is heavy from baby's weight, so I wouldn't wear this for more than an hour at a time.  I am also petite so baby sits closer to my chin than others would probably wear it. It is hard for me to cook or lift much with baby so high up.  I could definitely fold laundry and vacuum with this on.  It is simple to put together and am glad I spent less than 20 to try this type of style carrier.",5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"This is THE bouncer chair to have.  This chair saved us the first 5 months of our daughter's life.  She had reflux, and sometimes, this chair was the only place she could sleep or would not cry.  I almost cried myself when she outgrew it.  The seat sling is deeper than some of the other seats on the market, which makes it seem safer to me...I also liked that the activities and music were bright and happy.  Also, The activity bar removes so easily when you don't want to use it.  Now that she has outgrown it, I have carefully put it away in the event that we have another baby.  I can't be without this chair!  If you are confused about which bouncer to buy or register for, don't be.  THIS IS THE ONE.",5
Performance Carrier Color: Charcoal Black,"So the verdict is still out on the Ergo. Baby is 8 weeks old and we've managed to use the Ergo a handful of times. I have a feeling we may like it better once the baby is older, but for a newborn/young infant, it's not been ideal for us. Using it with the infant insert is a bit tricky and it becomes incredibly bulky. Baby seemed OK, but it was very hot and uncomfortable for me as the person wearing it. I stopped using the infant insert once baby had more head/trunk control, but even then she didn't really care for it and it never felt terribly secure. It works, so maybe it's just my baby. That said, the carrier does a great job at distributing weight on your hips, so is pretty comfortable for the user. I also really like the little hood and storage pockets.If you're going to get this, get it with the intent of using it once the baby is a bit older and can spread his or her legs around your body. I would NOT recommend the infant insert with this product as it's just not comfortable or functional.",3
"Sleepy Wrap Classic Wrap Baby Carrier, Dark Pink, 0-18 Months","I do love this wrap, I didn't give it all the stars though because it does still hurt my back when my baby is in it.  I have a big baby though 6 weeks old-12lbs.  Easy to use if you watch the videos on youtube.  I had to do it several times but now I have it down.  Make sure you put it on tightly!!",4

Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,"Do not waste your money on this pillow! I am highly disappointed after receiving and using it. I had high hopes that this would solve my sleeping discomforts, based upon the reviews. However, it is nothing like what the positive reviews say. It is fairly flat and should be stuffed MUCH more, especially for the price. Since it is flimsy, it moves way too much, and I am constantly having to readjust it. I have had to use several other pillows with it, and it continues to flatten more every day. I am seriously debating whether to return this product because of my disappointment. Try another pillow, if you are looking for quality - this is NOT a good one!",1

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I agree that these bottles are the best on the market!  I used them full time with my son, who is not out of bottles and I fully intend to use them again for my baby on the way!  All peices are very durable.  I love how you are able to interchange peices for these bottles.  I was able to use the bottles as my son's toddler cups when he outgrew nipples!  Not extra cups needed, just got the fittings separately for the cups!Unique and conscious design!  These were well thought out by PARENTS just like us!",5
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","With my first child, I was ignorant and didn't really research the stroller/carseat combo. I just went with what a lot of my friends and others had in my area. BIG mistake!!! I hated my graco travel system from day one. I thought it was fairly easy to put together (nothing like my B-ready which was so easy even at 8 months pregnant). My toddler loves this stroller!!! We mostly have used our umbrella stroller from the time that she could (I hated my graco that much), but love how high she sits up. We don't have to take her out just see animals at the zoo. I love how it folds up and is easy to unfold. I can't wait to get my newest one into it and try out my second seat!!! The only draw back I have found is that there is no travel bag to protect it when traveling, since we do a lot of traveling I will have to keep looking for one.",5
"Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Organic Cotton Wipes,  (Pack of 2)","I purchased these wipes as well as the double sided fleece wipes for my daughter. I use these wipes to wash her bottom when she urinates. The double sided fleece wipes work better for poop diapers. I have also used the cotton wipes to wipe her face and hands if they become sticky.I do not recall if I had any problems with them repelling water in the beginning but I don't think so. These wipes have gone through many washes and I do not use fabric softener on them. We use cloth diapers and I know that if we use fabric softeners on our cloth diapers, they will start to repel water and leak. I did wash the wipes prior to their first use as well.I feel that these wipes were worth the money spent and I like that I am not contributing to waste.",5
"Mary Meyer Christening Plush Rattle, Lamb","This is just so cute in person, just what I was looking for a gift for a baptism present. Thanks-",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","My wife really loves this, and chose it over the Boppy.  She liked it because it has the added back support and likes it a lot.  The one problem I had with it is the construction of the padding under the cover.  When we took it out of the bag it came in, it smelled like straight gasoline!  We decided to give it a try, and removed the cover and aired it out a little for a few days.  It subsided and was MUCH better.I think it has to do with the glue they use to put together the padding under the colorful cover, and the put it in the plastic display packaging before it has the chance to air out properly.  Either way, it works great after we got the smell off of it.  We are very particular about using clean and hypoallergenic items for the baby, so we would not have kept it unless we felt it was safe.I would recommend this to a friend, but I would also recommend they air it out before having it around kids.",4
"Badger Basket Portable Bassinet N Cradle With Toybox Base, Pink Waffle Ruffled","The bassinet had no hardware with it and we had to contact the manufacturer to obtain that - there was no cost, just inconvenience. The price versus quality rates this as 3 stars in my opinion.  The canopy stay crooked - flimsy materials.  The sheet is too coarse feeling for a newborn baby.  It will suffice for one baby for a couple of months, but if this would be needed for more children, I would have returned it.",3
Squatty Potty 9&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"Returned from a trip with some gastric issues and hurt my upper back at the same time.  Sitting in the normal position for long periods made my legs fall asleep and my back spasm.  This caused me more gastric distress leading to panic attacks.  As the hype about this product claims, one's business is done more quickly in the &#34;Squatty&#34; position.  It also kept the pressure off the whatever nerves my back was bothering while sitting.  It makes for an all around more comfortable toileting experience. I will continue to use this because in our fast paced world getting it done faster will be an efficiency and health benefit.",5
Imse Vimse Flushable Liner - 200 count (Baby),"These liners are not good! I bought these specifically to protect our baby's cloth diapers when he has to use heavy-duty diaper cream- they do not do the job well. They are rough, tend to bunch up, and tear easily, resulting in diaper cream all over the diapers. Great. We had another brand before this (I can't remember which brand) and they were much, much better. I strongly recommend buying a different brand.",1

My Brest Friend Inflatable Travel Nursing Pillow in Green Paisley,"I purchased the original Brest Friend pillow...(which I would give 10 out of 5 stars by the way).  I was unable to use my original one for a few days, and ended up with extremely sore nipples, and was ready to stop nursing!  Reminded me of the early days before I bought the first pillow.I purchased the travel pillow as a back up, and for traveling on very long flights.OMG, it's just as good as the original !  Easy to use, easy to carry, just love it. Extremely easy to fill up.  Takes less than a minute.  You definitely don't need a pump!Makes breast feeding so much more enjoyable.  Great price too!Update 16 June 2013:  I just traveled from the East Coast of the U.S. to Northern Africa.  I was able to use the pillow in the airport terminal, but unable to use it on the plane.  The seats were just not wide enough to support the pillow.  I had an empty seat next to me, but it still did not work out.I am still extremely pleased with the pillow, and may like it better than the original pillow! I keep one in the baby's room, and one in the living room.I would recommend this to any new mothers who are breast feeding, and want to enjoy it. I'd also suggest you take it (or the original) with you to the hospital.  Regular pillows just don't get the job done without a lot of discomfort!",5

Yesterday I walked through a small patch the stickers. One of the back tires went flat before I could get back to our car. I had to carry the baby, hold onto my 5yo, and push the stroller. I fixed the back tire, just to wake up this morning with the front tire flat from a slow leak as well.If I had been out hiking we would have been in a bind. I highly suggest keeping a small tire pump, and maybe an extra tube with the stroller.",5

He uses both ends of the banana and he likes to knash on the bristle end as his teeth are working through his gums.  It is silicon and I keep it in the freezer so he gets the cold on his gums too.

Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"I've owned these for three years now and have had no problems. We occasionally will pick up on the neighbors conversation (they must be on the same frequency as us) but we just switch channels and we're fine. I have no problem with static. Maybe we got lucky? I have had the battery die on us several times without realizing it, so a warning light would be nice. Also, the on/off button has become difficult to turn on one of the units. This just happened recently and I'm not sure why. These are minor complains though. Overall we've really liked these monitors.",4

Boba 4G Baby Carrier (Kangaroo),I love wearing my baby in this carrier. It has good back support and comfortable straps.  My baby has fit inside comfortably now from 14lbs up to 17lbs.

Baby Safe Feeder 2 Feeders &amp; 2 Bags Starter Kit,"As PPs have stated, this feeder is in 3 separate  pieces for ""easy"" cleaning. The BSF is very durable feeling and the plastic bits are easy to rinse off and throw in the dishwasher. It is a bit heavy, but not excessivley so. The mesh pouch also seems durable and is not as difficult to clean as other similar products. I soak mine in hot water for 15 or so minutes then finger rub the debris off/out before machine washing it. There are seams along the inside and at the ring of the pouch and most debris seems to get caught in the seam allowance. It is easy for baby to grasp and hold and the trouble it takes to clean it is well worth the enjoyment he gets from it. I highly recommend this product over similar ones.",5

"Lifefactory 9-Ounce Glass Bottle, Raspberry","I was torn between Life factory and the Pura stainless sippy for my 11 month old son. After several days of research there was only one thing I could do. Get both and see which one was better for transitioning my son from bottle to sippy. After using both for 3 to 5 months, I can clearly say that I like these better but the Pura sippy is better for transitioning because it has a silicone spout. My son took to the Pura Sippy right away but would not use these until he was fully comfortable with a harder spout at 13 months. Since my son is now fully comfortable with harder spouts, I have stopped using the Pura. The main reasons why I like the Life factory better than the Pura are:1. Very minimal leakage. I can give my son this bottle and not worry. Since the Pura has a silicone spout, if dropped upside down, the spout will open and leak. I also went out and bought all the harder Avent spout that is compatible with the Pura and it all leaks. The Avent spout has a small hole at the top and it will leak from there.2. Life factory makes a screw top cap that fits this sippy. Awesome for travel or mixing formula. Pura does not.3. Comes with the Sleeve! With the Pura, you must buy them separately and don't try using them w/o it. The stainless gets super hot and cold depending on the liquid. I put WARM milk in it and it felt hot. I was quite surprised.4. Has OZ markings on the outside of the sleeve. It's on the inside of the Pura. Not so easy to see.5. I like the look and the ease of the Life Factory. Just screw the spout to the bottle and your done!There are a couple of annoyances with the Life Factory sippy. The bottle opening is slightly bigger than the scoop that comes with the formula so a little bit of powder can get on the bottle. I'm pretty good at it now so it's not a big deal. Another thing is that the sippy gets very heavy when filled with liquid. This will obviously happen because it's glass. Pura also gets very heavy. It doesn't bother my son so I am okay with it.I read a review that says the liquid is hard to get out of this sippy. I haven't had this issue. You just have to make sure you pinch the slit open on the valve and insert it loosely into the spout. Then make sure you don't over tighten the spout to the bottle.In my opinion, if your child is okay with a harder spout, Life Factory is the way to go!***If you are transitioning, you might want to try the Pura for a couple of months since it has the silicone spout. I also found another sippy that my son took to right away and it helped him get comfortable with a hard spout. It's thegreen sprouts 7 Ounce Sippy Tumbler, Green. ***",5
"Baby Teether Ball, Assorted Colors","As other people have mentioned this toy looks a whole lot like a dog toy. So? It's great for teething and for general hand eye coordination growth. We bought this when our baby was 4 months old and it was an instant favorite. She can use it in the car seat, on her stomach and on her back. When I'm not able to pass her a new toy, I tell the big kids ""give her her puppy toy, it'll make her happy."" Smiles from the big kids who think that's hilarious, and smiles from the baby.

Dreamer Design Ditto Jogger Lite - Red/Gray,"This stroller is awesome.  We actually didn't buy it from Amazon, we bought it second-hand from another lady that used it for 4 years before us.  We've had it for 2 and it is still in great shape and I will continue to use it for several more!If you are concerned that it won't work for infants, don't be.  The seats lay back really far, and with some towels rolled up to keep baby supported and snug, I used it only days after giving birth.  I was even able to keep the other seat upright for my then 18 month old.We have pretty crappy roads and sidewalks here, and the inflatable tires are SO NICE.  I've had several strollers with different sizes of wheels, and even one with the big wheels but with hard tires, and they don't compare at all.  I just had an innertube go flat and need a new one, but that is the only maintenance it's needed in all six years.  It's a great investment for all the years of use you'll get and you'll have a fairly good return when you resell it when you are done with it.  (We paid $80.)It also folds up pretty well.  The first time I took it apart, it took a while to figure it out, but now I can do it in less than a minute.  It fits nicely in the back of the minivan with the tires off and folded up.",5
BOB Infant Car Seat Adapter For Single Strollers,I love our BOB Triathlon jogging stroller.  I hated when we were going someplace that might involve our daughter eating and we took the Graco just because it had a snack tray.  We bought the kit only for the snack tray but it really sits way too high for any infant. I realize it was integrated into the design of the infant seat carrier but the tray could have been designed to attach differently and be much lower.  Now we look silly while we boost our daughter with a blanket when she is eating.,3
"Bumkins Flushable Diaper Liner, Neutral, 100 Pack","These do the job, but we prefer the Imse Vimse.  We have found that with those if they are just wet and not soiled, you can put them through the wash and reuse them.  The Bumkins do not make it through the wash so must be thrown away whether they are soiled or not.",3
Puj Snug - Ultra Soft Spout Cover (Aqua),This is a flimsy cheap piece of foam.  It does not stay on the spout.  It is pointless and probably costs 2 cents to make.  I was extremely disappointed.  Save yourself from wasting your money and get the Skip Hop whale.  That is a solid item with a tie to secure it.  Love that product.  Hate this one.,1
"7 A.M. Enfant Stroller Hand Warmers for Parents and Caregivers, Cafe/Beige","must have for winter, easy on and off, great warmth, i highly recommend. yes i do, i most certainly do",5
The First Years Extra Tall Decor Gate,"Bought one, worked so well, bought another.  Very attractive.  That is the first thing visitors say and then how well it works.  I have a 40 pound energetic puppy and she has not been able to move it.  She behaves so much better if she is in the same room with me.  It works as well to keep out as well as to keep in.  Put puppy on the outside of the gate to wash kitchen floor.",5
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"Comfortable, safe, durable and hands-free.  What more could you ask for?!",5
"UPPAbaby Vista Bassinet Stand, White","I wasn't sure after reading some other reviews about this stand, but i was happy that i decided to buy it.i like that it was easy coming out of the box and its all one peice, no putting anything together, which saves time.the stand sets up and your able to put boxes or storage bins underneath the bassinet so you have quick access to the important stuff.being a new parent, still working out what to put in those boxes, but so far so good. The latch system is easy to put in and take off, so i don't foresee any problems.would buy again",5
"Baby Fanatic Team Color Bibs, Chicago Bears, 2-Count",Bought these bibs for my baby girl.  GO BEARS  Good packaging and they look to be from good quality materials.,5
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty","The seat is amazing, It has a great fabric and it's so supportive. My kid looks snug as a bug in it. I have bought both my recaro seats from amazon and both seats are amazing.",5
Summer Infant Newborn-To-Toddler Bath Center &amp; Shower,I got this as a gift and thought what a great ideal. boy was i wrong i used it twice and the shower stopped working. The tub was to short and cramped my newborn. I took it back and got another one and I got to use that one 3 times and found my self returning it the shower stopped workin. It was a good idea but not made good.the baby keep slidin off the sling. So i just got acheaper but better tub. i called the company to tell them about the tub. save your bucks...,1
Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen,"I bought this monitor for my second child after not having a video monitor for my first.  I loved the fact that it could rotate around a room.  I hated spending almost $200 for a monitor, but this thing is amazing!  I have children that do not sleep, and being able to see them has been so helpful for every day monitoring and also for sleep training. I love being able to zoom in and out and move the angle as needed when the baby has moved. I bought a Summer monitor on purpose because my audio only monitor was Summer, and the customer service was amazing - they replaced my broken audio monitor for free!  Today, my video monitor stopped working (it is one year old), and after calling them, we had it fixed within ten minutes.  They are amazing!  This monitor has been a must-have item for me!",5
RLR Laundry Treatment (Pack of 5),Sometimes microfleece is just the pits. Or it smells that way anyway. I've had some serious funk problems with my pocket diapers in the past but the RLR treatment really does get all of the funk out. Drop in a ball with your diapers (already washed). Then run 2-4 cycles until water runs clear. Dry and you are good to go.,5
"South Shore Precious Collection Changing Table, Royal Cherry","To be fair, the product has ample storage space, deep drawers and is a good height, but it came in a million little pieces that we had to pay someone $100 to put together. It took him three hours to do and it is still a bit shaky--drawers don't slide in all the way and come unhinged easily. It is functional for now but I can't wait for a good excuse to throw it out.",3
"7 A.M. Enfant Le Sac Igloo Extendable Baby Bunting Bag Adaptable for Strollers, Grape, Medium","I currently use this bunting on a Britax B-Ready with my 11 month old.I love the color (denim) it's gorgeous, and it is very nice and warm.I live in NY and this is great...I don't have to over dress my baby. When I take him out of the car seat wherever I go, I will take off his insulated coat before putting him in this or else he will over heat. He will usually be wearing a long sleeve shirt onesie, and a chunky cable knit sweater or similar.I like that if I'm out shopping I can unzip on both sides all the way down so he is not too warm.Purchased the size large and it's got plenty of room for him to use up until the end of the cold winter season.",5
Spill Proof Snack Buddy,I got it for My 19 months old son who loves small snacks when he is on his car seat. He cried since he wasn't able to grab the snack. The lid is easy to take off. The cup ended in his toy box.,2
Bright Starts Grab and Spin Rattle,"Excellent for the teething baby in your life!!! Easy hold, sterilizes along with there other teethers!!I would recommend it to anyone!!!",4
Summer Infant Baby Touch Boost Digital Color Video Monitor,This is a great monitor. I love the zoom and scan features as well as the talk feature. I saw some reviews say the power and talk button were too close. I have not had a problem with that.The only thing I am not happy with is the battery life. Some days it is dead before the end of the day. And that is even shutting it off when my daughter isn't sleeping and only using the camera to just check on her and shut it back off.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,This is by far my daughters (7 months) favorite toy. It took her about 5 minutes to figure it out and she hasn't stoped since. This item is built very well and is very sturdy. I'm happy I made this purchase. Thank you Fisher Price.,5
Mommy's Helper Cushie Traveler,"This has been really convenient for potty training, but the construction is flimsy. The seat folds out in 4 pieces when my 35lbs son sits on it, the seat sinks inward toward the toilet. More than once, one of the gaps has folded in and pinched him. I also have to hold on to him because it feels like the seat is going to collapse into the toilet. Maybe it would be good for a lighter child, but didn't work for me.",3
TY Beanie Baby - SMOOCH the Kisses Bear,"I got this as as little gift for my boyfriend and needed to ship it to his house because we wouldn't be able to be together on our year and a half. He loved it and it looks really nice on his shelf, not too girly either so it's a great gift for anyone :)",5
"Buggygear Heart Hook, Red/Silver","This is a great carry hook, not to mention cute!It's carried groceries on my stroller, packages at the mall and my extra toy bag for my children. I find it very useful and easy to use.",5
Snoozeshade Original Deluxe Sunshade and Baby Sleep Aid for Single Strollers/Joggers/Prams,I live in Spain where people like to peek in and touch your baby so I was excited to receive the snoozeshade. Not only does this item keep the sun out but it keeps unwanted hands out also! I love this and have recommended it to others already !,5
Kids Travel Organizer BLACK,"The right price for a highly functional caddy. We use it on the floor between the front seats in our ancient Previa van - keeps our ice scraper, road atlas, paper towels, etc. all nicely organized and a great place to shove extra stuff during road trips.",5
Skip Hop Zoo Playspot,"great for kids... and babies little play at the living room. I love this product, def worth the money...Great product",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"This monitor serves its purpose, but mainly when plugged in. I can't get much more than 4 hours out of the battery when unplugged. From experience I don't like to recharge or plug in a monitor until the battery is fully exhausted.  Doing so with this monitor is inconvenient as I'm up every 2-4 hours with baby & focusing on recharging a monitor is the last thing on my mind.  There is also no zoom or ability to move the camera if baby moves.  I only saved about $50-75 with this monitor & wish I had spring for the monitor with better features, albeit more expensive, it would have been worth it.",3
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","The baby loves this.  (2 months)  She isn't quite into the hanging toys yet since she is still working on hand eye coordination.  But, once she discovered the mirror and made a few kicks on the piano, she had a blast.We limit the time to avoid over-stimulating her since that seems to be the only reason she'll cry when using it.",5
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","I love this thing!!!  I love my new toy.  I have a two year old and had a audio baby monitor.  The audio one drove me nuts because I could hear what she was doing but most of the time I was still thinking """"what is she DOING!?"""" I just couldnt figure it out.  Was she awake? Jumping in bed?  Sleep talking?!  So I got a video one.  I picked this one because I read a review of a fellow picky mom and she loved it.  I picked this one because my girl is a light sleeper.  I needed the infared night vision.  Some others say they have a night light that you have to leave on to see at night...not true night vision.  Screw that.  So I got this one from amazon today and its great.  The picture is awesome.  I can see her breath.  See her blinking.  I love that I can move the camera around.  I just put it on the wall above her crib.  Ran the cord around so she couldnt get ahold of it.  I love that I dont have to worry about batteries dying because you can plug in both pieces.  The range is far.  My house is 2100 sq feet and it reaches far into the yard.  You wouldnt want to be farther away from your baby then the range anyways.  I put up a picture of her in her crib.  I took the pic with a tablet so its grainier then in real life.  Its pretty sharp in real life.",5
12 pack - Bum Genius One-Size Microfiber inserts with snap down design,My daughter in law loves these as a enviromentally friendly way to get thru the potty training period.  They are great for when the child is diapered without pants.,5
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"Great product! Sturdy yet soft, great back support, love the colors. My child can carry it by himself. Love it. Recommend it.",5
Jeep Car Seat Travel Bag,it has a handle on it and a shoulder strap too.. a little hard to carry and when it came off the plane the zipper was broke.. but we were able to fix it before the flight home and it made it,4
Graco Secure Coverage Digital Baby Monitor with 2 Parent Units,"Out daughter suffers from sleep seizures, usually in waking state.  Hiccups are a precursor to a potential seizure for her.  This monitor is crystal clear with its sound, so sensitive we can hear her breathing during the night.  No background static as you turn the volume up.  We use this in conjunction with a video camera that we can peek at to see her movements if we hear a noise.  Choose not to go with a video baby monitor as many of them turn off automatically after a minimal amount of time.  Our camera and this monitor is on till we choose to turn them off.  Hope this helps and good luck.",5
"Summer Infant Lil' Loo Potty, Pink","I bought this potty for my 7 month old at the time. She was 20lb and couldn't reach the ground while sitting on it. She can sit on her own comfortably if I put her on. I read reviews before purchasing and I agree that the back of the hole in the potty is more narrow than the Baby Bjorn and she doesn't fall though. It is very easy to clean and I love that front because my daughter can hold on to it, and the back has a nice support. We've been using it for a month now and we are very happy. The price is competitive also. I definitely recommend it.PS: I suggest buying the Potty book, I keep it next to the potty and it's a good distraction for times when baby wants to get off too early.",5
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Burpy Bib, Butterfly Patch",I love these bibs. Lovely quality and stylish with various uses. I now buy these for friends when they have a baby and everyone loves them.,5

"Munchkin Scoop Drain and Store Bath Toy Organizer, Blue","It's convenient and easy way of picking up toys.  Yes, it's not too big, maybe slightly bigger would have made it even better, but I'm content.  Saves time on cleaning up and maintaining tub free of toys.",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",I purchased this bra and have been pleased with design. It is very adjustable. I like being hands free while I am pumping.,5

"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog",Great blanket to cover eyes without covering nose or mouth for our light sensitive baby. Excellent for snuggle baby blanket.,5
"Kushies Waterproof Bib with Sleeves, Blue Circle, Infant","My son insists on feeding himself, which means that everything from head to high chair gets covered.  This bib covers most of that area and saves his clothes.  It's easy to wipe clean after.  My only complaints are that the Velcro at the neck is too easy for him to undo, the sleeves don't have cuffs so food rolls down his arm, and there's no side/back coverage, which is where he likes to wipe his hands.",4
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, White, Mesh",this is a great item.My friend just loved it and the item provided a great support for the baby and it is very easy to use,5
"GEENNY Boutique Crib Bedding Set, Beautiful Black White Flower and Dot, 13 Piece",I received this bedding set as a gift from my mom off my baby registry.  I put it on the crib a couple nights ago and it is really nice.  The quality seems really good for the price.  The pattern is very cute and the pink trim is the perfect amount of accent.,5
Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier Giraffe,"I really love the concept of this toy/pacifier. And I love how many models you can choose from! It is such a good idea to combine a pacifier with a plush toy. So cute, and so convenient to take in the car, or to give baby at night. I agree with people who say that the pacifier doesn't stay long in their kid's mouth: my baby, too, pulls the pacifier out of her mouth because she keeps grasping and playing with the giraffe. But that's ok with me, as long as she is having fun with it.However, I have to complain about the poor quality of this item:- I saw someone writing that the plush looked like a happy meal toy. Yes, it does, indeed! It is soft enough for my baby to enjoy, but I still feel that for the price it could be somewhat nicer.- The pacifier is not the best. The shape is actually pretty bad. The base of it shouldn't be round and have a 'cut-out' for the nose, like most other pacifiers do.- I HATE that the plush doesn't detach, it makes it so much more difficult to wash. I would actually have liked it if you could detach the plush to wash it, and why not re-attach it to any pacifier, so that you could change the color of the pacifier, upgrade for a 6+ month pacifier, replace it when it is damaged, etc. I get that they don't want you to buy another brand of pacifier, but couldn't they at least make a system where you can remove and attach to this brand of pacifiers, and sell separate pacifiers and plush toys? Kind of a 'mix-n-match' concept? That would be sooooo great!Would these points be solved (and they are easily solved), it would be one of the best items on the market for a young baby. I also bought one for my godson and he loves his so much, too, but his mom has the exact same issues than I do. Anyhow, I don't regret my purchase but hope that Wubbanub will make this product better before I have another baby...",3
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,I had a problem with charging the monitor but they sent me another adaptor and it's been great since then. Excellent customer service.,5
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"This pump has been awesome in every regard! I've used it from the time my milk came in, to pumping daily while on leave from work, to working full-time.  So many people made me nervous about not having an electric pump for work, but I had a hard time justifying the cost of an electric one when I was so successful with this pump.  When I returned to work full-time, it was often stress or nerves or just how far along I was with nursing that affected my supply, but I never did buy an electric pump and I never had to supplement with formula.  I'm still nursing full-time 9 months now and even though I ended up quitting work, I still occasionally pump and would recommend this pump to EVERYONE!  Avent is a great company to call and they are willing to replace parts free of charge - they've redesigned how the pump attaches to the bottle and the pump is perfect now!",5
Zanzibar Toddler Bedding 4 Piece Set,"I have the Zanzibar valances and lamp in my son's room so I was excited to recieve this bedding.  I live in Michigan and our winters are cold.  I was hoping the comforter blanket would have been thicker and warmer.  It is a thin fleece blanket with a cute design.  Great for fall and spring, but I question if it is warm enough for winter.  The sheet is clever.  It is fitted on one side so that it cannot ride up or be kicked off.  I like that given I often have to tuck my 2 year old in again after he falls asleep.  The design does have a lot going on but it is cute for a little one.",3
"Evenflo Triumph 65 DLX Seat, Lincoln","I searched long and hard for a car seat that would fit rear facing in my 2006 VW Beetle while still allowing room for a passenger to sit in relative comfort. This is the winner!  A passenger that is 5'7"" can still sit with a few inches to spare. This is a small price to pay when faced with the alternative of acquiring another vehicle.This seat also functions well. It is extremely easy to use, pleasant to look at, and comfortable. I will be purchasing another one for the larger family vehicle because its just that great!",5
"Kids Line Valance, Fleur",Exactly as described and nothing wrong with it at all,5
Boutique Brand New GEENNY Lavender Butterfly 13PCS Baby Nursery CRIB BEDDING SET,"This bedding set is excellent. The bed skirt, the sheet, the blanket. Everything fits nicely on a standard mattress and standard crib. It washes easily and the color holds.I've received many compliments on the color and how warm and inviting it is. Baby loves it Just cannot go wrong with this bedding set.",5
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,"I spent the extra money and bought this in white because I'm bright-children's-colored ""plasticked"" out. The rubber grips keep it from slipping. It's very sturdy and safe, cleans easily, and not an eyesore. It's only worth the extra money if you care about keeping your house from looking completely like Romper Room. :)",5
"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch","This is our first baby monitor, however, given all the issues our friends have had with other monitors (Summer Infant and Motorola), we are happy we purchased the Samsung SEW-3037W.  Everything works as described and the picture quality is what's most impressive.  It's so easy to use which is a plus.  We have tried all the features and have fallen in love with it.",5

"Re-Play Divided Plates, Aqua, Green, Orange, 3-Count","Love these plates! It's great for keeping food separate: carrots and broccoli in one part, protein in another and a starch or apple sauce in the third! They are durable and dish washer friendly.",5
"OXO Tot Plate, Green","My husband has a bad tremor in his right arm/hand and limited use of his left hand.  I got this plate for him because he kept spilling food off the side of his plate.  And this plate worked fantastically!!!!  We can't say enough good things about this plate.  It's the perfect size for our breakfasts, doesn't look childish, is easy to clean, and if your table is clean and free from any crumbs/dust then the plate will not slide around.  Absolutely fantastic.  Thanks so much for this amazing product!PS - I use it too (so we have matching breakfast plates) and it makes eating so much easier and a breeze.",5
Under the Sea Submarine Nursery Wall Sticker Decals,"I am very happy with my ocean decals because they are very bright & colorful. Also, I can move them a few times and they still stick to the wall.",5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo,"My 10-month old loves this jumperoo. We got it for her at 7 months and at first had to put an extra play mat under her feet so she could reach, but I think it eventually stretched out and she grew as well. The music and features are great. I also love that this can easily be broken down for storage. My only beef - as others have pointed out - is that the monkey and elephant (which she LOVES) are a little hard to reach and I wish they were on stretchy-cords. Now that my daughter is a little taller, she can pull on the monkey and elephant, but I'm worried that supporting leaves are going to eventually snap in half as I""m not sure it was designed for that kind of tugging!",4
Munchkin Dora The Explorer Toddler Dining Set,Perfect for the kid that loves ELMO if they are little ! the silver ware is very small and kinda akward because emlo is hard to hold ! but my daughter loves them because she loves elmo !,4
"American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Chenille Crib Sheet, Maize","I love these sheets.  They are super soft and cozy and they wash up really well.  They retain their shape, fit our standard size crib mattress, and best of all I love the look on my little one's face as he snuggles down into them when I lay him down for bed at night.I have 2 pairs that I keep in rotation for the winter months, but am considering getting a few more and using them on into spring and summer.  Who doesn't love a cozy bed to sleep in?Now if American Baby only made them in Queen size I'd be in heaven!",5
"Baby Essentials Nylon Baby Backpack, Orange and Grey",I bought this as my son got older and we didn't need to carry quite as many items when we left the house.  This is a great item for the price.  It has alot of space to fit things and insulated pockets to keep bottles cold.,4
Bambinos Tidy Table Tray,"I like this tray very much but I gave 3stars because the clip is not working properly with our table. Our table is 2'' thick and it is too thick to use the clip. This is the reason I was hesitated to buy first time because I saw one of the reviewers was talking about the same issue. I bought this tray just because one of the reviewers answered my question that he/she was not sure how much thick the table should be but the clip is kind of big. I really hoped the clip would be working properly because I loved all other parts of this tray. Even though the clip is not working perfectly with our table, I can still use the clip to hold the tray enough (I am not satisfied, but I can say I like this tray much better than other usual table mats... that's why I didn't return). Another reason that I gave 3 stars is that the center of green tray kind of sticks out. I thought I got a defective one at first, but I bought two of these and both have the same problem. The green tray is not level, so if you put bowls on there, it kind of moves around. the white part is flat-bottomed, only the green tray is not.",3
Soft Baby Pillow Insert,"This is a nice, soft pillow for the little people. It also works for a knee pillow for adults that need the help when sleeping. It washes well also.",5
Prince Lionheart Formula Mixer,"I bought this based on the reviews and I'm overall happy with the purchase. We recently had to switch our baby to a rice starch formula which is thicker and therefore much harder to mix by just shaking. We're also using the Playtex Drop-In bottles, so we can't mix in the bottle...I don't know if that makes the difference, but the only problems I can see is that it does splatter if you don't have a tall enough cup to put it in and it makes alot of foam and bubbles. It will get all the lumps out though which is what I wanted it for.So the conclusion: If you want a small mixer to get out all the lumps and cut the time of preparing bottles, this is for you. Just watch the foam and find something deep enough to make sure you don't get the little splatters it will create.",4
CherryCreek Decals Cherry Blossom &amp; Birds Decorative Nursery/Room Wall Sticker Decals,"Very easy to adhere to wall.  The picture is true to actual color. This comes in sections, so make sure you place the first piece exactly where you want it with keeping in mind the height and width it will come to be.  The template tells you that information.  Be careful with some sections as they can tear.  Although, the quality is excellent.  The finished product resembles a hand-painted mural. Will definately be purchasing others sets for the rest of my house.",5
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,"I first bought this product for my baby daughter and was so pleased I ordered a few more, which I gave as gifts.  This was the only thing that would help soothe my daughter, aside from being held.  She suffered from horrible colic for her first 3 months, so we tried everything to help her sleep, and the sweet music along with the soothing ocean scene worked great to calm her.  No matter how long it played, it never got annoying, as other toys that involve music can get after awhile.  It even has the option to switch tunes or listen to the sounds of gurgling water or turn off the sound completely.  It stayed in my daughter's crib until she was old enough to switch to a toddler bed and she never got tired of playing with it.  As she got older, she could turn it on by herself.  It safely attaches to the crib without damaging it over time, as some attachments can do, and is easy to remove and reattach as often as needed, but childproof, so you don't have to worry about your child being able to unattach it.  Nothing about this was complicated and the concept is very simple and very effective.  I was very happy with this product, as well as the price and would definitely recommend this for a baby boy OR girl.  It makes a great shower gift as well, as it is unique enough that you can be pretty sure no one else will give a duplicate, it's versitile and extremely affordable.  This was one of best things we purchased for our baby and one of the best values, too.  I highly recommend this!",5
"The Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Aqua Stripe)","Our then 2.5-mo LO slept fairly well at night but takes terrible naps. After reading all the reviews on the Woombie I decided to give it a try... and was so hoping this would be the sleep miracle!Well, it IS very helpful. LO hated being swaddled (wanted to move!) so this provided some movement... but she hates that she only has SOME movement. I think if we had started her in the Woombie from the beginning, this would be GREAT. As it is, while it does keep her asleep because of fewer reflexes jolting her awake, she gets super upset when she wakes up in it because she can't move freely. It hasn't helped her short naps, but I think it has made her slightly better at night when it comes to sleeping.All in all, I'm glad we bought it but we're starting it right away with the next baby!",4
"Britax Monarch Booster Car Seat, Royal Racer",Great booster seat.  Only thing is it is a bit tuff to buckle since the strap has to go under each arm rest.  I don't think my 5 year old boy will be able to do it any time soon.  It maybe that our seatbelt is to hard to pull out.  Either way I don't mind strapping him in.,5
Baby and Kids Clothes Laundry Hamper for Sweet Jojo Designs for Pink Groovy Peace Sign Tie Dye Bedding,This was the perfect addition that finished my daughters tye dye room.  With the cover flap that is not shown in the picture she is able to hide her dirty clothes.,5
Umai Authentic UNPOLISHED (RAW) MILK Baltic Amber Teething Necklace,This is a great product. I put it on my 4 month old son and he seems to be much calmer. It didn't help with the drool but I think it helps with the pain of teething. At night and nap time I put it around his ankle. When I forgot one night he actually woke up more frequently and was way more fussy.,5
"Harmony Kids Round Back Glider, Blue Chenille","My wife and I love this chair....it is very very comfortable, glides and swivels. We have the ivory chair, it is very nice looking. We really couldnt ask for a better chair for our nursery. It even looks great in the living room. I would highly recommend this chair. No squeaking.",5
Sassy Flutterby Teether Developmental Toy,It's been tough for us to find good teething toys that my son really likes.  He tends to prefer toys that are a lot thinner but likes the cold ones.  This seems to be an oxymoron when it comes to teething toys.  He does really love the colors on this toy and likes to suck and chew on the orange wings but the blue ones are a little too thick for his small 6-month old mouth.  Maybe as a toddler teething he'll like it better.,3
BRICA Bath Kneeler,"There is not much to this kneeler.  It is one piece and has a nice velcro strap to hang it up to dry if it gets wet.  It is plastic coated so it shouldn't get too wet.  It is a little stiff, but I think after a few uses will loosen up.  There is a cute little owl in the corner of the mat.",4
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Bouncer, My Little Snugabunny","I really do like this bouncer mostly because my son seems to really enjoy it...Or at least he did. We got this when he was about 3 weeks old and he loved it until he was about 4 months...now he doesn't like to be in it very long at all. First, the bird mobile thing is lame. When he was younger it would entertain him if we moved them around but they just hang there and do nothing and are bland in color. It doesn't keep his attention anymore. Second, like everyone else states, you will stub your toes on this thing a lot! Third negative, now that my son is more active at 5 months, he is constantly moving his legs and therefore he bangs his feet on the control box. He doesn't seem to mind but it makes me cringe because it is hard plastic, so I end up putting a small folded blanket on that part to give him some more padding. What I do like is the softness of the product, the music, and vibration. The music and vibration would put my son to sleep every time. I may be one of the few people who likes that the music and vibration shuts off after a while. It saves on the batteries and doesn't jar my son awake when it turns off. The head position pillow thing is rather annoying. I guess it is meant to be adjustable but it always sits really low so I am constantly moving it up when he sits in it. Overall, I like this product but I'm glad I'm not the one who purchased it because the price is steep for what you get. Even if the mobile just moved and was more interactive I think I would give this 5 stars, even if I do stub my toes all the time.",4
"The First Years Gumdrop Bottle Starter Set, Pink/Purple",Cute bottles cant wait till my little girl is born in August 2013. My wife loves them. Thanks a lot,5
"Stephan Baby Infant Boy/Girl Embroidered Christening Bib and Bootie Socks Set, White",Very nice product. I would recommend these items. They washed well and the bib had to be ironed but that didn't bother me.,5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","The bra itself holds the flanges very well, however, it just pushes them against your chest.  When i took it off I could see  the red circles it left from the pressure.  Plus, you can't massage for more milk with this on.  I highly recommend learning how to self-express, I can now get 4oz in 5-7minutes without any gadgets.",3
"Bumkins Dr. Seuss Receiving Blanket, Red Stripe","This was the cutest gift that I gave my newborn nephew, Benjamin! And he looks good in red ! Thank you",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Infant Starter Gift Set,I bought this brand of bottle after struggling with another brand and following the suggestion of our pediatrician. This is a much better bottle for her and they are so easy to clean! The bottle brush is great too.  We have only used the small bottles yet but I know we will like the large ones when she eats more ounces at one feeding.,5
"Munchkin Corner Bath Organizer, Pink","the idea of this bath toy organizer is better than the product... the suction cups on it are weak and do not hold up. it pretty much hangs by two, and i don't have that many toys... about a third of what is shown in the picture of the product",3
Sassy Wonder Wheel,"I work as an Early Interventionist with babies and young children who are at-risk for developmental delay.  I need a variety of toys which my little clients can use to practice their fine motor and cause-effect skills.  After a baby begins to play with a rattle by shaking it, using a spinning toy is the next play skill that emerges.  The Sassy Developmental Wonder Wheel Suction Toy is a good addition to my toy-collection because:  the suction actually holds the toy in place;  the wheel mechanism moves freely; there are three (3) additional mini-spinners, which also move freely;  the toy can be oriented so the baby can make it spin in two (2) planes -- clockwise/counter-clockwise or toward/away-from the baby.",5
"Luvable Friends Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, White","I ordered two of these.  They are a little roomy, which left enough room for a mattress pad.  They are very soft, and do not shrink when laundered.",5
"Fleurville Lunch Pack, Silver World Flag","My daughter used this for her second semester of Pre-K. The backpack was easier for her to carry than the shoulder strap lunch bag she used before.  It also has pads on the bottom to help it stand. There is an insulated bottle holder on one side and space for food containers on the other side. It can fit a Thermos Funtainer bottle, food jar and snack jar or a bottle, a sandwich container, small bowl and an ice pack. It has a sturdy handle on top and the back straps can be unhooked and stored in a pocket on the back, which has a place to write the child's name.  The pocket on the front is also insulated.  It's not big enough to store large art projects, but it can fit an envelope or folded letter-size papers.This is good for kids who carry lunch, but don't need a big bag to carry books. Since the straps can unhook, you can also attach this bag to another one if you need to use more than one.It's made without PVC or any other toxic materials and it also has reflectors on the front and back for added safety. The description here says it's machine washable, but the company recommends against that. I just clean it with a damp soapy cloth or a wipe.",5
"CoCaLo Sherpa Blanket, Snickerdoodle","So soft and cute! It finishes the 3- piece set with the darling stuffed Giraffe the we also ordered, perfect!",5
BRICA Stretch-to-Fit Window Shade,"This product is terrible- I would not recommend it.We bought this to use on our back windshield, to help my poor 4 month old son not have the sun in his eyes during our 1/2 hour morning drive.1) We have a very small (old style Honda Civic) car.  When this was stretched to its largest size, it only blocked a tiny portion of sun. I can't imagine how ridiculous it would be in a larger vehicle.2) More importantly, in a 20 minute drive we had to pull over 4 times to re-suction this to the window.  We almost ended up with a soaked passenger seat because the thing sounds like a gunshot when it flies off the window.3)  We tried suctioning it without stretching it the whole way, and without stretching it at all, and it didn't make a difference, it still didn't stay put.All of that being said, we got our money back.",1
Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,For the price of this mattress it's great. We purchased this for the portable mini crib even though it suggests nothing bigger than 2&#34;. It works great.,5
Babysight Digital Handheld Color Video Monitor,"I purchased this and returned it immediately because the camera unit became really really hot when plugged in.  I thought it must be a defective unit so I exchanged it for another one.  The second one did the same thing.  Neither unit was in the sun, or under anything. It was hotter than my laptop when the fan is blocked. I had the second one in the living room where I could keep an eye on it.  The camera unit is the part that would be in the room with the baby and it was certainly hot enough to start a fire if it was anywhere near clothes or something flammable!  I returned the second one for a refund.",1

"Pam Grace Creations Zigzag 10 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set, Teal/Lime",Bright & happy colors for a new baby. Gender neutral. Great quality. Rail cover is unique and I have received lots of compliments about it.,5
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"Based on previous reviews, I bought two of these at the same time; one for my grandson and one for his cousin. They both absolutely love it. They are 2 months apart, and each one started noticing, watching, and hitting it at about 2-1/2 months old. They love the lights, sounds, and look of this toy. It continues to be a favorite toy for both of them at different ages in development. The price is incredibly reasonable, so if you're looking for a great toy for young babies, this is it!",5
"Sassy Seat Doorway Jumper, 3 Toys","i bought this for my daughter at 4 1/2 months(its recommended for babies 4 months and up) she would never really jump in it so i thought she just wasn't the jumping type. i was sad that i had wasted $35. i continued to place her in it, because she didn't hate it, she would just sort of sit there. well i came across a graco jumper for really cheap so i decided to try it out since ive seen children have so much fun with these....and she LOVED it. she jumps around like crazy in her graco. the way the spring works on the graco is much more sensitive and you dont have to do much to bounce around, with the sassy you do. Also the graco supports on both sides and the back while the sassy only supports one on each side which makes your baby lean toward the side and isn't level. this sassy is more of a bucket seat so your child will also sit very low and my daughter was unable to have her arms out, the graco sits higher and my daughter can play with stuff on the tray. i dont know why sassy even adds those toys to the front when a child can't even grab them. i recommend the Graco Jumpers that come with a tray in front.",1
"Badger Basket Embassy Wood Baby High Chair with Tray, Espresso","Loved the unusual look of this high chair and still do. But it's got a few problems. The whole tray doesn't come out, just the plastic cover. This makes it really hard to put the baby in the seat. And even though that plastic part of the tray is easy to clean, food gets all in the nooks and crannies of the wood part below and is almost impossible to wipe up. Also, we had to put a folded blanket on the back of the chair so the baby wouldn't hit is head on the hard wood. And maybe I'm an idiot, but the buckles don't seem to stay on the straps. They buckle together fine but slip right off the nylon straps.I wouldn't recommend this item. You'd be better off with something padded and functional.",2
Chewable Teething Necklace for Teething Babies or Nursing Moms. Strand of 14mm Dark Blue Beads with 3 Faceted Gray Oval Beads in Center. Cord Is Knotted Between Each Beaded for Added Safety. Soft Silicone Food Safe Beads. BPA Free Non Toxic. Gift Box Included for Easy Gift Giving,"Love the idea of this necklace and my daughter likes it. I gave it 4 starts instead of 5 because I thought the beads were more of a navy blue from the photo, but they are closer to purple.",4
"Rumparooz Cloth Diaper Cover, White Snap",Great diaper cover. I use it for nighttime and it holds all the pee and poop. I don't change my 10 month old during the night so I was really impressed that there have been zero leaks. It's super comfy on my chubby baby's legs and tummy. Nice color and great material. Would highly recommend!,5
Safety 1st Swing Shut Toilet Lock,"I didn't like this lock for a number of reason's... #1 when you lifted the toilet to use it, it kept the lid from staying all the way up and would hit you in the back when you used the toilet or you'd have to lean forward. #2 my son would use the arm to pull himself ontop of the toilet. After only 2 months he was able to break the lock off completely. #3 when you remove the lock it leaves the sticky goo on your toilet lid. Now I have to not only buy a new lock but a new toilet seat. ONLY good thing about it was that it did keep him out of the toilet... until he broke it off that is ;) Thank you Safty 1st!",1
"NUK Gerber Graduates Fun Pack Utensils, 8-Count","Nice soft textured handles, good size mouth pieces. Single mould so nothing to come off and be swallowed. Having 4 of each is also good so that there always seems to be a spare. Good all round set of utensils.",4
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","This snack bag is in constant use of my preschooler. I find it pretty expensive, but I am glad I got it anyway. It is easy to clean, dries fast and has not started to smell to far (we have it about 6 months).",5
"Supergate Deluxe D&eacute;cor Metal Gate, Espresso","These are hard to beat.

"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Great for the nursery, sounds and projection work well. I did have to return the first unit because the nightlight didn't work, but did so with no hassle. We had a similar unit  that was a different brand that only held up for 2 months. This one also has the added feature of voice activation, we like it!",5
Munchkin Arm &amp; Hammer Disposable Changing Pad - 10 Pack,"I brought this mostly to save my diaper changing cover. When those poos kept on flowing, this was great to slide in and out and not waste diapers and/or mess up the table. It's really big, the size of the entire table, so I cut it down. But it does not leak which is great!",5
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","Although taller and heavier duty than the initial car seat (Primo Viaggio) it was a slimer fit into the car. We, he, out grew the first one long before reaching either 30lbs or 30in. Reccomend the Diono for the long haul.",5
"The Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Aqua Stripe)","I REALLY wanted to like this... but it just didn't work for us.  My 3 month old is always breaking out of his HALO swaddle and his Summer Infant Swaddle Me, so I was excited to see this since he couldn't break out of it.  Well, he breaks out of his swaddle because he wants to suck on his hands (then he sometimes needs to be reswaddled in order to get back to sleep).  This item left him unable to get his hands out to suck on them, however, he could still get them to his mouth and would suck on them through the fabric.  This was a huge issue because then he ended up with a soaking wet swaddle blanket... not exactly comfortable.  After the third time I put him in it, he had figured out how to get his fist out right up at the neck.  It made me nervous that he would eventually decide to force his arm through the neck hole and end up in a rather uncomfortable position.With all that said, I think this would be a GREAT product for a smaller baby.  I returned this item and will be sticking with the Summer Infant Swaddle Me.  That seems to work best for us.",2
"ERGObaby Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Natural","I use it to travel with my 6 week and 10 lb. baby girl. I take out of the carrier during the flight and she was in the insert all the time.  The only complaint is that it is to hot. and at the end of the trip, she was sweaty.",4

Unfortunately, many employees would use them up before we could get to them.  We put these up on the cabinets we wanted to secure, along with temporary notes.  Now we no longer have to worry about &#34;missing&#34; items, and after leaving the notes up for a few weeks, employees no longer try to get into the reserved supplies!",5

"South Shore Savannah Collection Door Chest, Pure White","i bought this because it was literally the exact design i had in mind. that being said it is cheap :P im glad my dad got it put together, but it was a hassel and the door hinges dont really allow the door to colse as properly as it should. i am very pleased with it as a whole, and it is a great piece for the price, but if youre looking for a NICE well made piece of furniture, id probably say get it custom made instead :P",3

Susen Safe Shampoo Shower Bathing Protect Soft Cap Hat for Baby Children Kids (Pink),Bath time finally became much easier. I really recommend this product to anyone even though it is made out of foam.,5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","I bought this play yard for my daughter to use at daycare. At home I have a basic Graco play yard without any decorations. My daughter instantly preferred this one over the plain one. She actually watches it in wonder from across the room. You can't help but take her over to it and let her play for a while because she loves it so much.The colorful decorations and toys are definitely great at keeping her busy. It folds up and transports easily. It is easily cleaned with a damp soapy cloth and if all else fails you can buy a replacement bag and/or mat affordably ($16 - $21 each). I love this play yard and recommend it highly to anyone looking for a roomy, stimulating environment to keep his or her young one in.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We bought Sophie for our (then) 4 month old daughter. She absolutely LOVES it! We love Sophie too because it is safe, non-toxic, and so easy to clean! My baby will hold Sophie and ""talk"" to her for hours. She doesn't interact with any other toy like this one. When it's nap time she must have Sophie to hold onto. We will probably be buying a second Sophie in case something tragic happens to the one we have!",5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Melodies and Motion Soother,"The description says that it plays up to 18 minutes, but this is true when listening to music only - when using lights and/or motion it will only run for four minutes after which it will automatically shut down.  Obviously, unless your child falls asleep in four or fewer minutes this product is totally useless.  Furthermore, this soother has fewer features than those sold for approximately the same price five or six years ago.  Rather than make a quality product, Fisher Price has elected to give you a cheaper product for the same price.  Cheapness seems to be the only attribute American companies are after these days.",1
"Britax Head and Body Support Pillow, Iron/Gray",I purchased this product for my double BOB. I was concerned about my newborn not having any head support. I have been using this for 3 months and love it! It holds him right in place and he fits great in it. It looked big when I took it out of the box but after I got it and my baby in the stroller it's perfect. The stroller straps fit right through the opening between the head and arm support so the straps are where they should be. The material is great and has held up over a few washes. I love that it's reversible now that it's summer. Would definitely recommend for stroller use.,5
"Pepperpot Baby Record Book, Molly's Nursery","I was looking for a baby book that was similiar to the one my mom kept for me when i was a baby.  A book with places to record firsts, illnesses, immunizations, etc.  It comes with a nice plastic box too which is nice to store loose papers in.",5
"Evenflo Portable BabySuite 300, Marianna",It fits perfectly and the ease of opening and storing is amazing. Amazons delivery was fast and speedy...I would recommend this to anyone considering a play yard or portable bed.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether Set of 2,"This is such a cute animal and a very durable one as well.  My grand-baby adores it and chews on it daily.  The reason I bought two is that the original one for the older girl finally began to show some wear.  Pretty good to last over 3 years!  She loved it so much, I got her a new one and also one for the new baby.",5

Baby Trend Snap N Go EX Universal Infant Car Seat Carrier,We love the fact that it is universal for all baby seats.  I also like the two wheels in the front for more control and stability,5
"Britax Advocate 65 CS Click &amp; Safe Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","To start off let me say I have been a faithful Britax fan after trying out various other brands with my older one.This is absolutely the best built, safest car seat out there for your baby, that said, it does not work for all babies.Only for skinny ones.  I have fraternal twins, both normal sized, one is built slim and long, coming in at the 50% onwt for ht etc, while the other one is at the 85th% or so in wt for ht.  Neither is off the charts or anythingAnyway, the chubbier one, outgrew his 22lb companion seat at close to 8 mo, so I purchased two of these seats toswitch both over to rear facing since I could no longer use the snap n go stroller and appreciated that unlike theconvertible roundabout available 10 yrs ago for my oldest, this one could keep him protected for a long while.Had to buy it sight unseen since it wasn't available locally.The biggest con for me on this seat but it is a deal breaker -- The crotch strap is completely under my chubby little ones butteven with the infant body pillow taken out.  At least it works for my skinnier child.  I called Britax, and they were totally unhelpful,they do not make a longer crotch strap for me to purchase or anything.One more con - This is a giant seat in terms of width. I have two lexus trucks the RX and the LX.  Even on the LX, withtwo of these side by side, I cannot seat someone in the third seat in the middle row.  In the RX, you cannot even installin the middle position and have two people sit comfortably on the sides in the back row.  So the side impact protection comesat a huge cost.I didn't really want to go for a minivan, so I am using this britax  towards the window, and have purchasedtwo more of this car seatSunshine Kids New Radian 80 Convertible Car Seat - SuperCoolfor the middle position.No side impact protection, but I decided that was ok for a middle seat.  The radian also has a top tether forsuper safe installation.  Only issue is that it is a tall seat,(quite a few inches taller than the Britax)so the person in the front seat will be uncomfortable.  The skinny radian permits a third person to sit in the middle orback row of my LX and RX respectively.To summarize, pick the Britax if you need only one seat, don't need a full back seat of seating, and can install as a window side seatin a normal size car.  And absolutely only for a skinny baby.The Radian, you can buy if you want 3 in a row say, or all functioning seats in the back row.  But for rear facing prepare to bevery cramped in front if its in anything but center position.",4
"Summer Infant Sure and Secure Double Bedrail, Blue",I bought this for my 2 yr old.  We didn't want to go to a toddler bed to save money so we bought this...works great.  He is a crazy sleeper and hasn't been able to fall out of bed.  We'll be using it for awhile!,5
Playtex Baby Binky Most Like Mother Latex Pacifiers: Pink,"I bought these because they say they are most like mom, as I was breastfeeding, I wanted to ensure that he didn't get nipple confusion.  I brought these to the hospital with me and only allowed him to use these, although I was hesitant to let him use any paci at all and I ended up not really letting him use it until he was able to hold it in his mouth without dropping it every five seconds!!  Needless to say, he has only used these paci's since birth and won't take anything else.  They seem a bit large, but it's no bigger than my nipple and that doesn't change sizes, so why should his pacifier!!  He loves it, and I highly recommend for nursing mothers.",5
Bright Starts Having a Ball Get Rollin Activity Table,Absolutely love it!!!!! Defiantly recommended to purchase this item... My child loves it!!!! :) great idea for children under 2,5
"Britax Pavilion G4 Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage",This carseat was very easy to install (much easier that the directions make it seem). It is way more secure and comfortable than the Graco infant seat I was using. The color and pattern are very pretty.  It fits nicely in my car and is very stable.  The latch hooks are really easy to install. I am extremely happy with this purchase.  Getting one for dad's car too.,5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",I was determined to purchase a comfortable and safe car seat for my 3 yr old.  We looked at the Britax Frontier but after reading reviews on the Graco Nautilus and seeing the great price we chose to try it instead.  After one week I ordered a second one for our 19 month old.  These seats are great!  They are comfortable and well made.  The boys love the little hidden pockets and the cup holders but I like how solid they are and the fact we can use the 5 point harness for quite some time.  Overall a great buy!,5

"Aden by aden + anais Easy Swaddle Blanket, Oh Boy!, Large","These are the best. I bought this for friends who were having a hard time keeping their 4 week old swaddled.

"5 Piece Dark Gray Suit with Shirt, Vest, and Tie - Size 10",The quality of the suit is superior and looks identical to the suit the groom is renting for the wedding. When I took the suit out of the box and realized the quality...I was excited!  The zipper tie is also fascinating and very convenient especially for small children.,5
Taggies Soothe and Snuggle Me Sleeper,"I had to return the competitor's version of this so it got this one instead since I could remove all the fabric to wash it. This is a very important to me when deciding on a product. I loved the other one & recommended it to everyone, but now I can say I like this one even better! It is a little more slender so it's easier to fit between the wall & bed. It allows my baby to stretch his legs out. He is 6 mo, btw, & still fits in this. It's very sturdy. The grippers on the bottom stick to the floor good. It has a vibrator & removable cushion. It folds up for easy storage & travel! Love it!",5
Hands Free Breastpump Bra Halter One size fits most,"I got this as a first try at an easy/quick to use hands free system.  So far I have found it works great for me.  I am a large size (F/G cup), and the setup of the regular size out of the package only needed minor tweaking to fit me perfectly.  I have read other reviews where there were complaints about itchy velcro, but I have not experienced any issues with it.  I just try to take care when putting on the halter (have used with and without clothing underneath) and have not experienced any itchy issues.  The neck strap doesn't seem to be needed once I got comfortable with the halter itself and felt more assured that once it was in place it was not going to move, and trust me, once you start pumping it is not going anywhere!My only negative would be that the velcro is really good = read noisy.  My little one startles at the noise if I try to open the halter quickly to remove it.  I've simply adjusted my timing and open the velcro closure slowly to prevent scaring the heck out of him.I'm glad I didn't spend a ton of money for one of the more fitted bustier type hands free systems when this one works like a charm!",4
Jeep Jogging Stroller Weather Shield,"We bought the Jeep Liberty Limited Urban Terrain Stroller and it fits the stroller well. The reason a lot of people are saying it does not fit is bc they are trying to place the rain cover over the cup holder. In order for it to fit, you need to run the cover UNDER the cup holder and it WILL fit. Works very nicely.",5
"Summer Infant Slumber Buddies, Frog","This is very cute, it works great. I bought it for my newborn daughter and my 3 year old son loves it!",5
The First Years miPump Double Electric Breast Pump,"I am using my husband's account to post this review. I liked this pump until, I like the others, had power reduction in the motor. In my case one side would pump at full steam and the other was pumping at the first speed. I called the 1 800 number and spoke to one of their representatives. Even though the warranty had expired,she express mailed me a brand new pump. Not just the motor an entire new box with everything we had originally purchased. They also included three etra sets of tubing, and extra set of valves, two extra shields and an extra bottle.They also included shipping labels so I could send the pump motor in for thier engineers to take apart and study. Now after the amazing customer service I will make sure to buy Learning Curve products. It nice that they stand behind their products.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Monkey Teether,"We bought this for our son when we needed a teether that he could hold and he LOVES this thing.  The only thing keeping it from being 5 stars is that it's kind of heavy, and when he flaps his arms and it hits him in the head sometimes it sort of startles him.  This is a great toy, and easy to clean.",4
3 Pack Snack Trap (colors may vary),"The idea behind the Snack Trap is fantastic, but as the other reviewers have stated, the lid does not attach securely enough.  I know it is just a matter of time before my little one pulls it off and I'm right back to where I started!",3

"Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Pink","I bought this after seeing a friend use it for her little one, thinking it was such a novel idea. We've been using it for about 6 months now and the product has been a great addition to our collection of baby gear. It's very durable and easy to clean. It makes going out to dinner a breeze without having to sanitize the whole restaurant! So far, it's been a great investment.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"Maximum recommended weight listed as 96 pounds online In the Amazon description. When the jumper arrived, the maximum weight in the instruction manual is only 25 pounds!!!! VERY disappointed. Our bambini would only be able to use for a few weeks, if that long. Waste of time & money. False advertising.",1
"BESTEK drain stopper hat shampoo cap bath hat shower cap baby shower accessories baby hair shampoo and body wash (with ultra-adjustable hook loop, blue)","There are several of this kind of hat on here and almost all have low reviews due to size. I went with this one because it has the snaps and can be easily altered to adjust for larger sizes (kind of like the hair tie trick to make pants bigger). It is a bit small. My 11 month old's head is large enough and small enough that he's somewhere between the largest and second to largest setting. So I have it at largest. So I drop a star for size.As for how it works? It is awesome. We only have a shower in our home, no bath tub, so washing his hair was awful, he'd scream and get water/soap in his eyes. But I used this for the first time today and it worked great. He didn't even get fussy. He's in that stage where he fights getting dressed and diaper changes, so it was a bit of an adventure to get it on him. I wound up snapping it before putting it on him and then pushing it down onto his head, but I'm sure it'll get easier as I use it more. I'm very glad I bought this, and I'm happy that showers will no longer be awful for him.Edit: My son is now just over 12 months old and the hat still works great for him! And I was right, it's a lot easier to get it on him now.",4
Onya Baby Carrier - Outback - Black,"i love how the mesh material doesn't cause my baby to sweat so much when in it, but i have a big problem with how the mesh irritates my baby's face, arms, legs, and whatever it brushes against. it's quite abrasive, really.another thing to note is the buckle placement on the adult's waist/hip part. i'm not sure if it's just me, but my baby's knee seems to hit or rub against it all the time.otherwise, i think it's a great carrier.",3
Kidco Door Finger Guards,I have been using the door finger gaurds for a few weeks now. They do their job but the adhesive is very weak. I had to use super glue to get them to stick.,4
"Aquatopia Safety Bath Time Easy Kneeler, Blue",A great product - makes bathing baby easier and much more comfortable on your knees and elbow.  I would recommend this to anyone with a baby or child.,5
"Ulubulu Pacifier Set, Pull to Sound Alarm and Mute Button, 0-6 Months","My son loves these pacifiers, but I was quite disappointed when I ordered them from Amazon. To remove the pacifiers from the package you have to snap off two plastic tabs, when I did this I noticed that there was a long piece of hair wrapped around the nipple. I have no idea how it got there but there is no way I am going to use these with him!",1
Fresh N Freeze 4 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 6-Pack,These are ok. The pureed food I put in gets freezer burned on top. They don't close great. I wouldn't buy again.,3
"Infantino Union Ergonomic Carrier, Gray",I desperately wanted to love the Ergo (sport model) with my son and well.... he hated it. He was so smushed & curled up in it and he really didn't like that feeling so I ended up selling it. He liked the Bjorn better since he could have his arms out & it kept him secure but the bigger he got the more it hurt to wear. A few months later I found this one at the thrift store for $5 so thought it would be handy to have since he's getting too big for the Bjorn. I tried it on and WOW. It fit perfectly & super comfortable. I can wear him (11 months & 23lbs or his sister 3 years & 30lbs) very easily and they both love it. It might be harder to adjust for smaller babies but I've never tried that so can't say. It's AWESOME for bigger babies/toddler though!,5
"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","Received item and set it up for expectant baby. It looks great and is easy to set up. It seems very sturdy and safe. We will have to see how our son likes it in a couple of months, but it had great safety ratings/reviews.",5
Zo-li Buzz B. Baby Nail Trimmer,I love this product. It does take longer to use but I don't have to worry about hurting the baby.,5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","My daughter sleeps so well in this sleeper.  Such a great buy.  Keeps her at an incline position, which she loves.",5
"Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","My son was on his way out of a stroller, but still would have needed a rest during big trips. This stroller was so perfect! I was stopped often by people asking about it, and I told them to get this exact model. It is small and light and as easy to use as a typical single stroller. Many sit and stands were bigger and heavier. This one is the one you want!",5
Fisher-Price Take Along Swing- Woodlands,"This is the weakest swing ever.  It states there are five levels of speed, they are all the same, weak and slow.  I was surprised that it would barely rock my 8 pound one month old.  I can't imagine that it would rock her when she grows, it says it has a weight limit of 25 pounds.  I find that hard to believe.  Would not recommend at all.  I returned it.",1
"Beebaba Backpack Diaper Bag with Insulated Bottle Pocket, Eco-friendly Heine Series (Black)","This is a great backpack diaper bag. It helps us be very organized, while still being able to bring what we need. Love it!",5
Infant Optics Add-On Camera for DXR-5 2.4 Ghz Video Monitor (DXR-871),"I obviously had bought the camera and monitor first. We had problems with our first camera before ever getting a chance to use it. I figured maybe something had happened causing it to break so I went ahead and bought another camera. Pulled it out of the box and the exact same issue, it powered up for about 2 seconds and then I smelt an electrical fire and it powered down. Total piece of junk.",1
Dream Baby Drawer Catches 3 pack,"For a Mommy who is amazingly precise with power tools and measuring, these were 20 times more difficult to install than they should be. Plus your drawer has to have the right features or they won't fit. Using them is okay, once installed. But I recommend placing them on the side of the drawer that is less accessible to baby's hands, otherwise baby will grab at them. Also, coach your spouse not to slam drawers or these will ruin.",2
"Natursutten 2 Pack BPA Free Natural Rubber Pacifier, Butterfly Orthodontic, 0 - 6 Months","Perfect texture and softness, yet durable.  The closest thing to a real nipple which is why I think my LO took to it (unlike every other pacifier I tried to give her).  The orthodontic shape is the natural shape made when she's sucking for comfort (versus breastfeeding), another reason I think she took to it.  I have 3 of them (2 for home and 1 for traveling) and will easily spend the $9 on more if they need replacing.  I also really like the groove for under the nose so it gives her room to breathe, as well as the size - it's big enough that she can find it in her crib in the middle of the night to self-soothe herself back to sleep.  And because it's soft everywhere, it doesn't wake her up if she rolls over it or turns her face onto it.",5
Boppy Slipcovered Body Pillow,"The Boppy Slipcovered Body Pillow costs $55 with PRIME membership mailing. Overall, an attractive pillow. I found it too soft for my body needs firmer support. Also, the slipcover could have been eliminated since it's challenging to get the pillow back into it after washing, which you must due to the chemical smell. A firmer, washable pillow with a durable fabric would be more appealing to me. Also, I do not believe this pillow is worth $55. I would not pay for this. I've had regular body pillows that cost less and work just as well.",1
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",Easy to put together and very versatile. The only drawback I found is that the belt buckles were recalled as soon as I received the new seat.Ordered the new buckles and I'm ready to replace them as solos as they arrive.,4
"Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefold, White, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I loved how soft this diaper was out of the packaging. It remained soft during my several prep washes(to remove natural oils in the fabric). After my final prep wash, I found several holes forming along the seams. I never used the diaper, I just returned it as defective. The holes formed after only 6 washes and I couldn't see it holding up to numerous washes during the products intended use. I can only guess that I got a diaper sewn from a bad batch of fabric, I can't imagine these holes being the norm for this company.  I considered replacing the diaper, but would be disappointed if another prep routine was wasted on a diaper that may have the same problem.",1
Yo Gabba Gabba Ultra Soft Toddler Blanket,"This was a Christmas gift for our daughter.  The purchaser selected the wrapped option, so when I got it, I looked at the invoice, saw that it said ""Yo Gabba Gabba Ultra Soft Toddler Blanket"" and thought, great!  Come Christmas, our daughter opened it and imagine my surprise when she pulled out an all-black toddler comforter!  The company ran out and replaced it with what it deemed to be a ""suitable replacement"".  Nope!  It wasn't suitable for our teary-eyed daughter.  After 1 phone call, they shipped (overnight) a blanket.  I have no idea where they got it; it had been showing ""unavailable"" for a while.  Anyhow, the blanket is her favorite!  She takes it everywhere.  I've washed it many times due to this and the colors are still vibrant.  Well worth the wait and the customer service was outstanding.  Love it!",5
Mommy's Helper Tip Resistant Furniture Safety 8 Brackets,"This product is the absolute best solution I have found for securing our furniture so our toddler doesn't topple it. Here is why:- Durability, design: this product was built tough, easily customizes to whatever application you are putting it on (with brackets that can go vertically or horizontally and two sets of screws, long and short), and resists even the most forceful pull I put on a piece of furniture once installed.- Best price: this product was the most economical, costing us less per piece of furniture we secured.- Ease of use: it was incredibly easy to install. Simply mark where the stud is in the wall, and mark where that would be lined up on your furniture, move the furniture out from the wall, install the bracket either horizontally or vertically on both the wall and the furniture, start threading the zip tie, move the furniture back, and complete pulling the zip tie through so the wall and furniture are connected.The only extra consideration you may need to make is that you may need other sizes of screws in case the small screws are still too long for installing the brackets on a shelf or something with less depth.",5
"Boppy Pillow with Luxe Slipcover, Monkey","I really love this its versitile and had I breastfed I probably would have used it more. My boyfriend uses it more often than I do because it keeps his arm from going to sleep while holding the baby. Furthermore it makes a good sleeping pillow for adults, so technically it will never be grown out of. :)",4
Baby Einstein Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym,My 1-month-old loves this mat. She likes to lay and watch the lights and listen to the music. It's also great for tummy time.,5
The First Years Disney Pooh Deluxe Sunshade,"This shade is definitely cute.  Amazon mailed it right away.  When we put it up on the window, it was pulled down a bit to far and it ripped from the top after only being up a couple of days.  I wound it up a bit higher so it couldn't rip further.  So that worked,  unfortunately after only about 2 month's worth of use, the bottom suction cup keeps popping off the window.It's no great big, hairy deal, but it would be nice if it stayed in one piece and stayed attached to the window.I choose this shade because of the poor reviews so many other shades have received.So, I guess it's still one of the better ones.--- oh, and you have to be sure not to roll down that window!  We haven't made that mistake yet, but you do have to be mindful of it.mk",4
Cocalo Daniella Six Piece Crib Set,"Absolutely love this bedding set. My favorite part is that it is not so girly and babyish that her whole room will need to be changed within a year. The set is so elegant, everyone compliments the bedding. The quality so far seems good, though I have only washed it once on delicate cycle. It has delicate material so I would suggest always using a delicate cycle in the washer. I would definitely buy this set over again.",5
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","We purchased this product because of our very active 4 year old that would get into everything...so far, we are very satisfied with the product, ease of installation...we would recommend it!",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",It has two remove able tops just as shown in the picture good grip on any chairI am very satisfied I am regretting for buying the expensive baby high chair,5
"Evenflo AMP High Back Car Seat Booster, Pink Angles","We got this seat as a spare booster for my husbands car and we love it. It is only used about 2-3 times a month, but my son says he likes it just as much as the one he rides in every day in my van.",5
"Dream On Me Elora Collection Toddler Bed, Cherry","this is a beautiful bed , my daughter loves it and it fits well with the decor in the room very durable design I can sit on it while putting my daughter to sleep and the bed doesn't even Creek.",5
"Colgate Classica III Foam Crib Mattress, White","This is an excellent quality mattress and after 2 years it is still in perfect condition.  I have owned less expensive mattresses and after time, they either lost their shape or become too soft and almost flimsy.  I love that there is a very firm (but still comfortable) side for infants and you can later flip it to the toddler side.  We will be purchasing a second Colgate Classica III Foam Mattress in a few weeks for our new baby. I would absolutely recommend this mattress!",5
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink",This definitly makes my children washing there hands a much easier task.  I think it makes them feel like they have a little more control.,5
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count","Producto de calidad, es excelente y el uso ha permitido validar la durabilidad del mismo. 100 % recomendable. es lo m&aacute;ximo",5
"Sesame Street Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 40-Count","My son is potty-training and these are a lifesaver at public restrooms!!  They fold small enough to fit in my purse.  They stick to the seat really well, so I feel better about using any potty.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,We bought one of these gates at a garage sale before our baby was due a couple of years ago. I didn't know anything about it and didn't even really know what we'd use it for. We LOVE this gate!!! So much that we just bought another one new. The vertical bars are great to keep kids (or dogs) from climbing over it. The step peddle is way too hard to push down for my son to manage (he's 28 months old) even if he tries - which he really doesn't. :) I frequently have hands full so the ease of opening without hands is hugely useful and appreciated. It's also easy to control and can be opened and closed very quietly if you have someone napping nearby. The only suggestion I'd make is to clean under it regularly if you have lots of animals and/or dirt in the house. I know that sounds funny but we have one in a doorway and when we shut the door it will push the foot pedal and move the gate a smidge each time. We also have a houseful of animals and dirt and I didn't think to take the gate out to clean under it regularly so the dirt from the motion of the gate wore away at the finish on the hardwood floor underneath. Not the gate's fault! Love these gates!,5
Cars Airplanes Construction Trucks Wall Sticker Decal for Baby Nursery Kids Room,I bought these to give a different look to my boys room and it worked perfectly! And when you have to take them off they don't lift up the paint.,5
"Vital Baby Toddler Straw Cup, Orange, 10 Ounce","I guess if I had read the description a bit more carefully I should have realized that the spout is actually not a true straw, but rather a hard straw-shaped spout that your child will suck from. The ""straw"" part of the cup is just the straw inside that draws up the liquid. If you already noticed this, then you are a step ahead of me. That said, I don't mind that much that it is not what I think of as a true straw cup (with a silicone straw on top).Overall, it performs fine and my 2-year-old daughter has had no problems at all drinking from it. The valve seems to be adequate to prevent spills, and it doesn't seem difficult at all for her to suck from, though she has been drinking from straw cups since about age 1, when she switched from bottle to cup, bypassing the sippy spouts.My main complaint about this cup would be the way the two-piece top is designed. The description did not mention -- and it is impossible to tell from the photo -- that there is a solid-colored top that screws on the cup (the piece with the spout), and then a clear plastic piece that snaps over it. The lid is attached to the clear plastic piece and flips down to cover the spout. My only guess about WHY this two-piece design is necessary is so that you could, I suppose, remove the clear piece entirely if you did not want or need a lid. Otherwise I'm a little bit puzzled as to the purpose. *shrugs*However, the problem is that if you do want this piece on, then liquid becomes trapped in between the clear piece and the main piece with the spout since they fit together tightly, and you'll have to pry them apart before washing, or else you'll have icky stuff festering between the two pieces. And who needs that? I curse this thing each time I have to wash it because they are hard to pry apart, and even takes a little elbow grease to snap them back together. Meh.",3
"NoJo Night Light, Butterfly",The flower is to heavy to hanged on the wall plug. So you can't really use it I use it without the flower,1
Infantino Stick and Play Highchair Toy,Adorable toy but pretty much worthless because it constantly falls over. Flower is top heavy. Ordered a few more sassy toys and they stick much better. Waste of money....ugh,1
Evenflo Comfort Select Dual Auto-Cycling Breast Pump,"I only use it twice a day at work and it has never given me problems. Suction is good, not great. You can plug it in to a wall or use batteries, this good for on the go use. Fits with my Dr. Brown bottles.The only con I have is it's really loud.Other than that its a great pump I use everyday.",4
"Nuby 2-Pack 10 oz No-Spill Cup with Flexi Straw, Colors May Vary",Let me first start by saying these are the only sippy cups i have been able to get my daughter to drink out of so i will keep buying. My problem with them are they often explode in hot cars when left there. When i say explode i mean red juice covered my cream colored seats and ceiling of my new honda crv. We went to disney and walked to the tram. Realized we forgot my daughters cup in the car we walked back to get it. When we opened the car door we saw the cup was shooting the red liquid everywhere. And i mean EVERYWHERE. We have a new water only rule in the car with these cups. Had one explode in my face on an airplane too. On my flight i didn't know what was happening for a couple of seconds. I knew liquid was hitting me but i didn't know why or where it was coming from. So my delayed confused response meant i got to spend my entire flight sticky covered in juice. I just need to remember to unscrew the top but these were unfortunate ways to learn this. Also if you forget you have unscrewed the top this causes accidents too. If their on my porch or even in my living room and it becomes warm at all liquid starts to come up and will soak whatever its sitting on. So forget about ever throwing one in a bag. I bring a thermos with me and an empty cup because i've soaked a couple of bags. My daughter also bites the soft mouth part and once it gets a hole you can't drink liquid out of it. I probably buy one a week. Now that i'm writing this review i'm thinking i'm an idiot for letting this fruit juice explosion go on any further and will try to find a new cup.,1
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","I got this to go in the diaper bag, and it's a good size and well made like the large bag I use at home. My only complaint is that there isn't a strap or loop or anything so I can open it, hang it up, and toss stuff in while changing baby. It's easy enough to sew one on myself, but I wish I didn't have to.",4
"Evenflo Tribute Sport Convertible Car Seat, Daisy Doodle",I like it. It is comfort & fit of a shirt . The color is so beautiful. My baby don't cry when she is setting,5
"Britax Advocate 70 CS Click &amp; Safe Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx",My daughter is 3 and has been in this seat for awhile.  It is very sturdy and appears to offer a high level of protection.  Also has a place for a cup holder to snap on that is very convenient.,5
"Graco LiteRider Stroller, Tango in the Tongo","I don't regret buying this stroller. It is easy to push, and goes through anything, including the gravel roads we live on. It's not hard for me to unfold it one handed, and it's lightweight. I would purchase it again.",5
"BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Red","I needed a bib that would catch crumbs that were getting all over my baby's lap when she ate bread. This bib was perfect, and I love being able to wash it so easily. Unfortunately however, my 9 month old figured out how to pull it off within a week. She just pulls the bib until the plastic piece comes out. Such a bummer, as it pretty much renders it useless if I can't keep it on her.",4
Sliding Closet Door Lock 2-Pack,After only a week the door latch was ripped off the wings are to weak they broke right off. It was easy to install but I wouldn't buy another one.,1
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"After much research, I had it narrowed down between this and the Diaper Genie.  I got this one and I LOVE it!  My son is now 8 1/2 mo. and we keep this in our family room.  My husband thinks every baby product is a crock, but he even commented about how great this diaper system is.  This is on my short list of baby items I couldn't live without!",5
Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"I like this mattress pad cover b/c it's much easier to put on than the Evenflo one I have.  My Evenflo one you have to tug, pull, and stetch to get it on and even then it's not on perfect, a real pain.  It does &quot;pill&quot; a little after being washed, but it doesn't concern me, you put a sheet over it anyway.  My 5 month old daughter's diaper has leaked a couple of times overnight and the mattress stayed dry, that's all I need!",4
Stroller Net Tote Bag,"I got this item, because I saw that another buyer had bought it for her family trip to Walt Disney World and it worked great!  I figured that you couldn't go wrong for a dollar right?!  Well, I wish that I would have though again.  The bag itself seems good and that it SHOULD hold up.  On the other hand, the straps that hold in onto the stroller are not long enough at all!  they reach JUST far enough to go thru the buckle and back thru on our umbrella stroller.  I have tugged on it, and most times it doesn't come free, but sometimes it comes loose.  I think that I am going to have to make my own adjustments to it.  Add buttons, or velcro so that it has extra support.  On the picture it looks like it would work great if you have a stroller that the handles are connected...mine are not.  This doesn't allow me to slide the straps closer together.  Just think of this when you buy as to what kind of handles you have.  It looks kinda cheap in quality, so I don't think that I am going to put in anything other than diapers and light items in it.",3
Sesame Street Elmo Aviator 4-Piece Toddler Bedding Set,"I bought it from a different vendor and in store, but its the same bed set. WE LOVE IT! My son absolutely LOVES it and I have washed it multiple times and not had any problems!",5
Summer Infant 2-in-1 Cushy Cart Cover and Seat Positioner,"I just love this. I had an old, hand me down cart/highchair cover so I bought this new one. It fits literally every cart I've tried from Kroger to Target to Walmart or any other store. I love the cushion and so does my son. He relaxes right into it and I have little toys clipped onto the provided loops and he just snuggles in and plays while mama shops. The cell phone holder is great too. I actually at one point put Bubble Guppies on YouTube and tucked it in and he was smiling and excited. We have used this at multiple restaurants as well for high chairs(without the cushion of course) and it makes the high chairs more comfy for him too. I would recommend this to any mom!",5
"Kids Line Hamper, Mosaic Transport","This is cute and looks nice in the nursery. Definitely worth the money if getting the rest of the mosaic set. Well made, too.",5
Baby Trend Single Snap N' Go Stroller,"I bought this stroller at BabiesRUs - it was one of two brnads/models they had for sale. (The Amazon price is about $10 less than I paid.) I've used this stroller many times and find it very easy to unfold/fold, the storage basket is ample, and the parent tray is convenient. I have no complaints at all with it. In fact, I had some paralysis in my hands as a result of my pregnancy, and I bought this stroller when I still couldn't move all of my fingers and my hands were very weak, and I could still fold it with one hand. It's very easy to use. I see that another reviewer had trouble with hers/his tipping over. I've never felt this stroller is unstable. I've used it with a Graco car seat and haven't had any trouble with its stability at all.",5
TUPPERWARE Shape O Ball Toy,This toy is for my greatgrandson and everyone of my kids has had one.  It's a great learning toy and you sell it forless than Tupperware,5
5pk Velcro Closure Bib Cutie Pie Born to Be Wild Motorcycle (White),Bibs are cute but last one is blank.  Kinda of a deception in my eyes.  Overall they are cute and ok.,4
Skip Hop Zoo Playspot,"I have had my eye on these tiles since I was 6 months pregnant with my third and I'm so glad my son is old enough to roll around and play on them! I love the modern colors and design - much better than the bright primary color mats I used with my older kids.  They clean up nicely and are easy to put together. Unlike other reviewers, I haven't had any issue with paint peeling off the animals.",5
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,I didn't want my daughter to have to pack up every time my Grandon came over and this pack and play with the firm mattress added was perfect. Easy up and down and to travel with.,5
"Vital Baby Press 'n' Pop Mini Freezer Pots, Orange, 1 Ounce, 8 Pack","When I started making baby food, I thought I would appreciate the small serving size.  Unfortunately, one ounce is just too small for anything really.  They quickly ended up at the bottom of the baby food container options.",2
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,I bought this organizer since I will use the pack and play in our living room for changes. I have the Graco basic pack n play and it does not have an attachment for diapers and supplies. This fit perfectly and holds everything I need.,5
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,My grand-daughter loved the duck and bath time was enjoyable but it doesn't squeak/quack like it says it does.  It is great to put in the tub and easy to empty the water and clean out.,3
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I am crazy about this cover.  It has double gussets and we never have leaks.  Before switching to cloth, we had blow outs all of the time.  We never have problems now.  This is my favorite cover.  Thirsties are economical, durable, and beautiful.  They wash up perfect and are dry in no time.  This is my go to cover and the color is perfect for a boy or girl.  I will say they seem to run small.  It fits my lo perfect now, but she is only 12 lbs.  It may fit up to 18 lbs but I think it will be tight.  That is just my opinion.",5
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","I was just in a major fwy car accident. Hit at 60mph and spun through three lanes of traffic with my kids (ages 1,2,&3) three across in this car seat. The kids did not move an inch and the car seats withheld the impact to a degree I never thought possible. My kids came out with no injuries aside from a tiny (1 inch) skin irritation from the strap on my only forward facing child on the side of impact.",5
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",This product worked while I used it.  It just took over our whole bed!  I was so big I didn't want anything because I was always uncomfortable,5
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","I thought this was a good alternative to the teethers that have the liquid in that you freeze, however, because of the appearance of this teether my baby thought it was a pacifier and gagged on it several times causing spitting up. It is a bit large, I think it would be better made in a smaller size.",3
"JJ Cole Satchel Diaper Bag, Green Arbor",Just recieved this in the mail today and I am So excited to start carring it!! Plenty of room and seperate compartments for anything you can think of. I also ordered the JJ Cole 2 bottle cooler with it and its also great. Definately reccomend!,5
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado",A great liner for cloth diapering. No holes etc for having washed & dried it even though you're not supposed to dry PUL. Keeps the stink contained & fits a regular sized trash can.,5
"green sprouts 6 Ounce Oxo-Biodegradable Milk Storage Bags, Clear, 25-Count","I am happy about the quality of these bags...haven't had any issues with them at all.  And the fact they are green bags bakes them even better, especially for the price!",5
Hospital's Choice Fold Up Nail Clippers,"We had the Summer Infant clippers first.  They came in a two-pack, with a smaller clipper and a larger clipper.  Neither one worked well.  The larger of the two didn't work at all.  These Safety First clippers cut every time.  For those of you who know how difficult it can be to clip a baby's nails, you also know how frustrating it can be to finally get the clipper positioned right and then have it not cut.  AAAAARRRRGGGHHHH!These work every time.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","I was very disappointed to receive a fake skip hop bag.  The picture and name clearly made it seem like I was buying an authentic product.  I have purchased many different skip hop items form Amazon, but this is the first time I have received a fake.  No use returning the item as the cost isn't worth it.  I think Amazon should refund my money for allowing this to have occurred.",1
BOB Infant Car Seat Adapter for Chicco Single Strollers,This adapter makes it so easy to take the Chicco car seat and attach it directly to the stroller.  It seems very safe and sturdy.,5
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,as soon as we got it my daughter doesn't want to use the potty anymore. great seat and it fits perfectly,5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count",I would give this product 5 stars for touch and feel. Very soft. Easy to wear and wash. However they are awful at containing any amount of leak. I go through all 6 pads before morning is over. And forget about them working over night. The smallest amount of milk soaks right through to my bra and shirt. I have gone back to disposable pads,1
Munchie Mug - Top Rated Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Ages 1 to 4 years. Made in AMERICA. - BPA and phthalate free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top,Finally a snack cup that doesn't spill. I highly recommend this product. The only time my son's cereal still falls on the floor is when he grabs too much out and they fly out of his hand as it passes the cloth.,5
Ellie Reversible Bumper by Cocalo,it was a little pinker than i expected from the original photo but it is very cute. love the fact it is reversible too. Sheet really completed the look.,4
Ginsey Dora Folding Travel Potty Seat,"I thought it was wonderful when I first bought it for my 2 year old, when we were first potty training. It was perfect for those in store potty runs!  However after about a month of using it, as my daughter became more comfortable using the toilet, she started trying to wipe herself etc. The movement and weight of her on the toilet seat caused the weak plastic to flex, pinching her bum, then sending her and the toilet seat crashing into the toilet. My potty trained two year old, is now refusing to sit on ANY toilet seat, because it &#34;Hurts&#34;. If I can coax her into going, it's a screaming match, and I have to hold her over the toilet seat (While I'm 5 months pregnant!) Waste of money.",1
"Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 2.8 Inch","We have been using this for over 2 years and are very happy with it.  I like the noise volume indicator lights, which have more lights lit up when she's crying louder so I can see if I better hurry up and get out of the shower in the morning.  (Our vent fan is loud so I can't hear it well)  The battery life is still good, at least 3 hours unplugged with checking the screen frequently.  It's more helpful for us now to be able to see what she's doing as a toddler than as a newborn.  Newborns don't try to climb out of cribs when mad.  We used a picture hanger nailed into the wall above her crib to mount the camera, so 90% of the mattress is visible.  When she was around 5 months old, she started rolling over at night and was MAD about being on her tummy.  It was nice to be able to see, yes I need to go turn her over vs I'm just fussing cause I feel like fussingIt's also compact enough we take it on all of our trips (It's been to USVI and mexico, plush all over MN and WI).  Now saying &#34;night night&#34; to the camera is part of her going to bed routine.",5
"Philips AVENT ISIS iQ Uno Electric Breast Pump, White","This is a great product for the money! I had no problems with it, and I used it for a solid six weeks since my newborn wouldn't nurse. I found it easy to use and clean. No problems.",5
Fisher Price Precious Planet Deluxe Auto Mirror with Music,I bought the Fisher Price Precious Planet Deluxe Auto Mirror with Music so my daughter would stop crying being alone in the back seat not able to see me. I would have to reach back and touch her hands before she would calm down or pull the car over on a number of occasions.  My oldest had a similar item in 2000. She loved it and stayed quiet. No such luck with the little one. I guess she does enjoy the music at times but it does not do much else to quiet her down. She is 9 months and ignores it most days. Maybe as she grows older she will enjoy seeing herself in the mirror. I think it would be nicer if it had lights that light up randomly on each animal,2

Mamas &amp; Papas Sola Stroller - Plum Petal,"We bought the sola in plum petal before our cruise trip and now have been using it for three weeks, it's really the best stroller among all the strollers we have owned and tried. I read some reviews before the purchase saying the wheels came off and front wheels appeared to be stuck, we have not had those issues. The wheels coming off seem to be an old version sola and the manufacturer has fixed it from the reviews I read on both U.S. and UK forums. Regarding the front wheels getting stuck - I think it was likely due to the owners didn't raise the brakes all the way up, we didn't know this in the beginning and felt the front wheels were not moving smoothly, but once I read the manual thoroughly and lifted the brakes all the way up, the ""stuck"" feeling of the front wheels was gone completely. We love the stroller so much and it well worths the money.Pros:-Very stylish beautiful stroller (better looking than uppababy, I was hesitating between mamas and papas sola and uppababy cruz before the purchase and couldn't be happier when I saw both strollers in person after the purchase)-Parent facing.-Smooth ride. I love the big rear wheels! I can push the stroller with one hand.-Everything is so easy and smooth - assembly, switch the facing direction of the seat, adjust the footstep, adjust the harness, adjust the recline position, put on and remove the holding bar, adjust the push bar, brake on and off......-Appropriate padded seat - not too bulky, not filmy, the fabric is soft and high quality, my 6 months old baby girl seems really enjoying sitting and sleeping in the stroller.-Seat is higher than some other stroller - the height makes it comfortable for me to feed the baby when I sit on a chair. The other two strollers we owned have the normal height seat, every time I have to bend down to feed the baby, causing my arm and back pain after a while. Our daughter is still too young to use the high chair in restaurant, now with sola, we just push the stroller closer to the table, play with and feed her, so convenient, worked well each meal we had on the cruise ship! The higher seat also gives a good clearance to the basket underneath so we can put a lot of stuff there.-Stylish and big canopy - some reviewers say the canopy is not big enough, for us, the size is appropriate, and our sola didn't have the net/see through part in the middle of the canopy that another version has, which was complained by parents that caused babies exposed to sunshine & got redness on their skin. Our sola has the peek poo window on the canopy.-Very easy fold and open. We have a mini van, so the size of the stroller after folding is not a problem for us. It is not an umbrella stroller and not compact after folding, it could be a con for parents with small cars but not for us. We actually like it that the fold and unfold is so simple.For us, the sola doesn't have a con although the not too compact size after folding could be a con for some parents. But there is no perfect stroller, the sola is by far the best stroller from the functionality / feature perspective according to our opinion.",5

Lambs &amp; Ivy Raspberry Swirl Warm and Cozy Blanket,"I bought this for my two year old as we are switching from baby to toddler. Her room was already decorated in this pattern as was her crib bedding. I didn't want to spend the money to change everything around just yet, but we needed a bigger blanket for her toddler bed. We really like the design and it's very soft and my daughter loves it. My only complaint is that it is shorter than I wanted. About the same size as the crib comforter (maybe a tiny bit longer). I was trying to save money on buying the toddler bed comforter that matches and getting this instead. If you are thinking about doing the same, spend the extra to get the comforter as this isn't long enough. Other than that, it was a good buy.",4
"Taggies Classic Take A Long Plush, Bouquet","The taggie is cute, the only thing I didn't like was the color. I purchased it for a boy and it definitely looks more pink than blue....deceiving in the picture.",4
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","The bamboo swaddling blankets are even softer than the regular Aden and Anais swaddling blankets (which I still love). They get softer with each wash. Because they are super stretchy, it makes swaddling baby that much easier, and they are the perfect weight of fabric for baby to stay comfortable all night. We used these every night until our son was about 3 months old and began to break his arms out of the swaddling. These are now my go-to gift for new parents!",5
Infantino Right Angle Tummy Triangle,"This is for sure a cool idea. My (now) 2 year old son hated tummy time, and maybe he would have liked it a little more if he had been propped up with the tummy triangle. However - my daughter has never minded tummy time and seems to be too old for the toy, even though she's just barely at the higher end of the suggested age range. I agree with many of the other reviews in that it would help, but I'm not sure it is necessary. Essentially, the same thing could be created for much less expensive with a couple toys and an infant support pillow - all of which could be used elsewhere as well. The toy wasn't easy to put together. While it's obvious what has to be done (I never even looked at the instructions!) it did take a lot of muscle to get the red feet snapped into the plastic so the play bar could be held. One thing that Infantino really got right is the mirror. My baby absolutely loves mirrors and really enjoyed looking at herself in it. It would be nice if the bee could be grabbed and pulled. She was reaching for it, and obviously wanted to play, but it was always just out of reach.Overall, I think there's something to be said for the convenience of the Right Angle Tummy Triangle. It's not a must-have baby product, but it's definitely a nice thing to own if you've got the disposable income or generous friends/family.I have received the Right Angle Tummy Triangle from Infantino to facilitate my review.",3
"Zoli Baby Bot XL Straw Sippy Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack, Green/Pink","Ughhh..... these cups. I love the design. I love the weighted straw which is perfect for new learners. I absolutely HATE how these leak!! They leak from the sides. They leak from the straw. And its not just a tiny bit of water... we're talking a puddle. It is so incredibly frustrating. I tried everything to stop this from happening from wiping down the lid and the rim of the cup to adjusting how tightly the lid was screwed on-- nothing. I also tried pulling the straw as i heard that would release some pressure (???) and i broke it. I bought another thinking that maybe washing it in the dishwasher had something to do with it and it happened again. I found a much better cup and it's the Foogo by Thermos. That cup is incredible. That being said, i may (sigh) still use the Zoli for my next kid in the beginning (the very, very beginning) to learn how to drink from a straw because the weighted straw is a genius idea but will switch to something better like the Foogo i mentioned above as soon as possible.",2
Jeep Baby View Mirror,"In the product discription it says that the mirror is 10x9x2 inches. The mirror I received is 2x4 inches.  I was hoping for a nice big mirror to put facing my rear facing child so I can see him in my rearview mirror.  This mirror is made to attach to the windshield or somehow clip onto my rearview, although I see no way to attach the mirror the the clip.  I'm very sad that the discription outright lies about the size of the mirror!Update:  I went to the makers website and their own page discribed the mirror as 5x7, still much bigger than the 2x4 mirror that I received, so I contacted the company directly and they are sending me a 5x7 mirror with no extra cost!  The customer service was great! Kind person, timely response and like I said, they are sending me the one I thought I was ordering in the first place.  Although, there is still no way to attach the mirror to the visor clip.",3
Who's Shoes Kids ID Kit (BLUE),"I was searching everywhere for a safety tag that could not be wiped/pulled/ripped off.  My son is a nonverbal 7-year-0ld diagnosed with autism & would have no way to give crucial ID information if he were to get lost (my biggest fear).I absolutely LOVE this product. I attach it to his sneaker & it remains secure & noninvasive to my son.  I have tried virtually everything, including expensive ID bracelets/necklaces, only to have him rip them off.I always buy extra to share them with other parents who have very young or special needs children. These come in both pink & blue & are worth every penny!!! I just wish these were sold in packs of 4 or 5, instead of just 2.",5

"Lorex LW2450 LIVE Video Home. Pet, and Baby Monitor with Pan/Tilt Wireless Camera (White)","I'm not sure why they keep saying these are baby monitors when the box clearly says HOME monitor on it. That being said, this is a great product for home security. I have a previous version (or smaller one) of this that I had reviewed before, using it also as a home security camera. This new set is much better and has more features, such as the pan & tilt camera that allows a much greater viewing area. This also has a nice two way talk feature which is so handy if you live in a big house. It also features night viewing so if you use it for outdoor security or inside your house at night, it still ""sees"" everything, regardless of lighting. It has sound activated recording too which I can imagine being useful in just about every circumstance! One little perk I like is that it also monitors temperatures in the room. My house, being big and drafty (and frightfully cold this month) needs better temperature monitoring than what I have been doing previously. This camera set really helps me keep things balanced in here.This is nice also in that you can view remotely, what is going on in (or out) of your house (depending where you have the camera). I do travel a lot in the warmer months, and it will be awesome to keep an eye on my house when I am away. It makes me feel SO much better to have that luxury!It shows on the box that you can also expand the system with buying an outdoor camera, and I am definitely going to do that, so I can have that looking around my yard, and then this one covering the inside. I think these security systems are fantastic, and since I live in a big city where crime is unfortunately rampant, you can't go wrong buying cameras like these to safely and inconspicuously monitor your home.I very highly recommend this set for that use, or even as Amazon tries to sell it for - as a baby monitor (though incredibly elaborate for that).It's a premium quality camera/monitor system that will serve you very well and give you priceless peace of mind.",5

"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","This is fabulous! Before, I would wake up in the middle of the night to feed the baby and I was super engorged and/or leaking through breast pads. I would have to feed my little one, wait for her to fall asleep so I could put her down, then pump before going back to bed. Now, I can pump and feed her at the same time, which allows me to go back to sleep much quicker!As for the product itself, it is extremely well made, the fabric is amazing, it fits great and is VERY adjustable. I have not washed it yet, but I can tell from the quality of the fabric that it will hold up very well for a LONG time. I definitely recommend this.",5
Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,I decided to try the magic sleep suit after the reviews I've read fr amazon.com. My 4.5 month old daughter have started fighting with the swaddle me and has not been getting good sleep since. Since we started using the sleep suit she has been sleeping good. Not more than when she was not fighting with her swaddle but same! I use it sometimes at her nap time and at night. I highly recommend this. I will even buy another one once she out grows this one. I would like to note however that the only reason I am giving it four stars is that the item i received had its zipper broken after one week of use. I emailed the seller (sleepsuit) and they replaced my item promptly.,4
Bright Starts Sugar Blossom Melodies Bouncer,This item is inappropriate for any child that can't lift their own head. I purchased it for my 1 month old and she slouched down in the seat so her chin was touching her chest. After readjusting her several times I realized she couldn't sit in the seat unless I propped something underneath it which isn't very safe. The toys are also pretty useless from what I can see. They don't come attached and are too close to her face. Definitely spend the few extra dollars on a better chair if possible.,1
"Luvable Friends 4-pack Water Resistant Bibs with Pocket, Blue","I really like this brand, the bibs are really cute. Nice quality, but the soft side of the Velcro is made of cheap material. It doesn't stick to the rough side, so my baby can very easily pull the bibs off during meal time. I'm going to have to attach a snap on them so he can't get them off. Other then that I'm very happy with my purchase.",4

Kidz Delight Smithsonian Kids Space Tablet,"First, the machine has three modes: Discovery, Exploration, and Quiz.  When you use Discovery mode, the tablet tells you the name of that picture along with one of many bizarre sounds.  When you use the Exploration mode, it gives you some brief statements for each item.  The Quiz mode is a quiz. I didn't do much with the Quiz mode because I think the Exploration mode is too disappointing to care what it quizzes on.I understand that this toy couldn't contain all the information about the planets but some very basic information I would expect to be there is lacking. I was looking for more of the standard information by which most of us identify the planets:  Mercury, smallest, closest, fastest.  Mars, Red Planet.  Saturn, rings.  Uranus, outermost planet. Just a few words inserted into the sentences they use would have helped (see my example number 2 below).  Also, if you look closely at the picture of the tablet, you will note also that the position of the planets in the solar system is very poorly depicted and incomprehensible to a young child. A picture CAN be worth 1000 words, but not this one...Some buttons have one statement for that picture, some have two.  Here are some examples.1.The stars button says only that ""Stars are very far from the Earth and are very hot.""  Why didn't they mention that stars are made of gases, example: ""...are very hot because they are made of gases"".2. ""Mercury looks like the moon because it has craters and basins."" I would have used two lines, such as: ""Mercury, the smallest planet, looks like the moon because it has craters and basins.""  ""Mercury, the closest planet to the sun, has the fastest orbit.3. Saturn's two lines don't mention its rings.4. Mars says only ""Mars has similar seasons to the Earth.""  Now, how hard would it have been to at least insert after ""Mars"" the phrase ""the red planet""?  This is something a child could relate to when looking at the night sky.5. The statement that Jupiter is the largest planet and has no solid surface"" should have added an explanatory phrase, such as 'because it is made of gases'.Here is a transcript of what is on the tablet under the Exploration mode:Sun is a star at the center of the solar system.Our system of planets is called the solar system.Mercury looks like the moon because it has craters and basins.Venus is the hottest planet and the closest planet to the Earth.The Earth is the biggest of all the rocky planets.The Earth is the only planet where life has been found.The moon is a satellite of the Earth.  It orbits around it.Mars has similar seasons to the Earth.On the 6th of August 2012 the robotic vehicle Curiosity landed on Mars to see if it once had the right conditions for life.Jupiter is the largest planet and has no solid surface.In many ways Saturn is similar to Jupiter but smaller.  (I DON'T THINK THIS STATEMENT IS USEFUL TO SMALL CHILDREN AT ALL.)Saturn is the second largest planet.Neptune has six thin, dark rings which circle the planet.Uranus has 21 moons.Pluto is the most famous member of a group of icy worlds on the outer edge of the solar system.Space shuttles were used to transport people and other things into space.The Space Shuttle Discovery launched the Hubble Space TelescopeThe longest-serving space shuttle Discovery flew 39 times from 1984 through 2011.In 1961 the Russian Yuri Gagarin became the first man to trave  into space.In 1969 the American Neal Armstrong became the first man to walk on the moon.In an observatory, astronomers use giant telescopes to observe distant galaxies.Space telescopes orbit the Earth and send  astronomers images of space that can't be seen in telescopes on the Earth's surface.Meteorites are rocks from space that strike the Earth.Shooting stars are fast moving pieces of dust and rock that catch on fire when they enter the Earth's atmosphere.Stars are very far from the Earth and are very hot.A constellation is a group of stars forming a shape in the sky.",2

Naturepedic MPS2438 Organic Cotton Portacrib Mattress,"I'm not going to worry about every little thing with my baby, but seeing as baby is going to be spending up to 12-14 hours a day on a mattress--it better be baby safe.  When I research on-line about the most dangerous things for a baby, I found off-gasing from new products to be the most toxic and specifically off-gasing from mattresses.  I think this off-gasing, which can mess up baby's endocrine system and do other nasty things is a really big deal and I would encourage all parents to research what you can do to keep the main toxic products away from your baby.  Start with a non-toxic mattress like this one!",5

Baby Einstein Count and Compose Piano,"Oh how my son adores this piano. It has a permanent place on his high chair and captures his attention the moment we put him in it.When we first used this he was ~3-4 months and he would press on the keys a little. Now, at 6 1/2 months, he slams this thing around and we've never had any issues. He loves the spinning part on top with the little balls - he is simply fascinated by the way the balls spin around. He knows how to (accidentally) switch from piano mode to counting mode with the little lever too. When in piano mode (or just normal play mode, as you have the option or flute, piano or xylophone) he slams the keys down and thinks he's really playing. It keeps him occupied for long periods of time which is great.We used ours for ~3 months before the batteries it came with (3 AA) died but we've stocked up on plenty of rechargeable batteries at this point.Overall, a great toy to keep your young baby occupied and stimulated.",5

"Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Standard Neck Bottle, 4 oz - 3-Pack","These bottles are the best at reducing air swallowed by the baby - unless you want to use those bottles with disposable liners. Seeing as I don't like to use anything ""disposable"" (as if we didn't create enough trash already!) these are the best choice.If your baby doesn't have huge problems with acid reflux, doesn't spit up a lot, and generally seems fine with feeding, and you'd like to reduce the parts to clean a little, you may also considerPlaytex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 6 Ounce. We use both, and both have survived 2 kids so far.*To clarify: Technically the VentAire bottles have the same number of parts. But since you can pre-build the bottles it seems like less hassle when you actually fill them. They also take a little less space. That being said - the child has to suck hard to suck air into the bottle and avoid swallowing air. If they instead open their mouth to let air in through the nipple the design is negated. Dr Brown's are still the best.",5
Deluxe Tandem Rain Cover - Fits 2 Canopy Tandem Strollers,"We bought this rain cover for our Baby Trend Deluxe Tandem stroller because we were going to Disneyworld and knew we would get rained on at some point during the trip. It didn't fit exactly right-had to pull it pretty hard to get it over the handle on the back and it ripped at the seam. It served its purpose though-it kept the stroller and the boys dry.It was also next to impossible to fold up into a small space again-I folded and squished it into a canvas bag that I strapped onto the back of the stroller. I have since kept it hanging there on the back of our stroller for days when we are caught out in unpredictable weather.The shield works great to keep high wind off the boys' faces, but in serious wind, it catches air from underneath and takes flight. The straps that supposedly secure it to the stroller do not fit the Baby Trend Deluxe that I have.Overall, we have gotten our money's worth from it, even though it doesn't fit perfectly.",3

Cool Gear Travel Potty,"This potty has been a lifesaver on many occasions during potty training!  Everything locks into place very well, so that it's sturdy enough for a child to sit on (not sure how much weight it will hold).  The only drawback for me is that I have difficulty unlocking the storage areas.  Maybe they lock into place a little *too* well!  But I generally leave the potty set up in the trunk of the van, and leave the storage area with the extra ziploc bags ajar (doesn't affect sturdiness) so that I can quickly get it ready.  I have ziploc bags in one storage area, and plastic grocery bags in the other so that I can put used ziplocs in a bag ... don't need to be seen walking around with a bag of pee.  :)",4

UPPAbaby Rumble Seat,"I have 2 girls almost exactly 2 years apart, and got this to add to my 2009 Vista when the younger was born.  I was skeptical about how much use I'd get out of it, and whether my older daughter would object to being in this seat, but I can say I am happy with the amount of use I've gotten out of the Rumble Seat in the last 18+ months.  It was less useful with the carseat adapter, but got to be really handy when younger sis could go in the regular toddler seat. So many options- sometimes the little one would be in the ergo and I'd use the Vista as a single, or we'd roll with it as a double. Once I got the hang of it, I could snap the rumble seat on and off in 30 seconds.Now, I have 2 walkers, and we don't use a stroller quite as much as we used to, but my 3 year old still likes to hop in the rumble seat and have a snack when she gets tired.  The girls prefer riding facing each other-- they don't seem to be bothered by the one having her feet in the other's face.  Sometimes they trade places for fun.  My older is super tall (38"") so took the sunshade off ages ago, and just use the seat without it. I don't miss it.Even with the second seat the stroller handles better than most full sized singles. Be careful that the foot rest is properly attached to the bars(it stays there even if the seat isn't on) - I got lazy and left the velcro undone and the basket ripped from the weight of the rumble seat occupant's feet.Would I do it all again?  There's a bunch of cool doubles out there now (like the city select) and so maybe my decision would be harder now.  Also, if you have 2 kiddos riding 100% of the time, a real double (like a side by side) might suit you better.  But given that I already have a Vista and could use a double now and then, the rumble seat definitely works.  Now I need to decide if I want to splurge for a piggyback too...",4
Sassy: Baby Food Nursers 4oz - 2pk(Green) [Baby Product],Since this is the only one that's not complete junk it gets a 4 and not a 3. I ordered a set of these at the end of july and my 7 month old already broke one. The other one is in the process and the plunger piece inside wont stay in. these are just cheaply made. These are however a life saver and without them would be a nightmare. I only wish i could find one in 8 oz as my little girl eats about 6 oz of food and when i take it to put more food in it she gets mad and screams till im back. If you need a feeder as i think everyone does this is your only option and works for a few months then it breaks. I have never put these in a dishwasher only washed them by hand. If anyone knows of a better feeder i would love some info. or one with 6 or 8 oz thats for food. NEVER NEVER NEVER LEAVE YOUR CHILD ALONE WITH THIS . These are dangerous and can choke your baby to death.,4
"Malden Sneak Peek Sonogram Juvenile Frame, White",I had bought this frame because I had  this for for my 1st grandchild.  I wanted a 2nd for there second child.  It was a great gift.,5
Evenflo Comfi Angled Bottle 9oz (3Pack),"I'm not very satisfied with these bottles.  For one, the rim of the bottle is more narrow than other bottles.  This means if you add your formula directly from the can to the bottle, the scoop doesn't exactly fit down into the bottle, allowing easy transfer of the formula.  You end up making a mess all over the bottle with spilled formula, not to mention, you are losing formula you should be using in the process!Also, the lids to these bottles are not a secure fit.  They will easily come right off, leaving quite a mess in your diaper bag.Save your money and buy another bottle set!",2
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Cuddle Cove Rocking Seat, Winslet","I wanted this one to get us through the first 8 weeks.  The cuddle cove rocker is perfect for toting baby from room to room when you are trying to get stuff done.  And the changing table is great b/c you don't have to leave the room for those many changes that come in the first few months.  I really wish the storage was bigger on the side.  Other Pack 'N Plays had nicer storage, but I bought a little caddy that I keep next to it.  Still giving it 5 stars.  I'm sure it will work just as well when the baby gets bigger and uses it as a play yard type set up.",5
Angel Dear Pink Bunny Blankie,so soft and sweet - perfect for a baby gift.  this turned into one of my daughters favorite sleeping toys,5
Trend Lab Baseball Shelf with Peg Hooks,"The Trend Lab Daisy Shelf is very cute and sturdy. I would give it 5 stars if it didn't have a rather large scratch on one of the flat panels. It is in a place that is not terribly noticeable, so we elected to keep it rather than replace it. The gingham daisies are a nice clear pink, BTW. In the photo, they look a little purple-y.",4
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium",We used this for our baby in his first few months of life.  Worked like a charm to keep him asleep at night.  I would highly recommend swaddling for anyone considering it and this is a very easy way to accomplish that task.,5
"Skip Hop Zoo Straw Bottle, Ladybug, 12 Ounce","As a mom, I don't have time to clean up so the sippy cups that like to spill everywhere are my worst enemy. This is no spill, the lid closes and opens easily which keeps me from worrying about the straw touching some nasty thing and my daughter doesn't have to bring it to me every time she wants a drink. It has a wrist strap that is easy to remove (if you get the safety harness backpack, you can attach the wrist strap to the front harness so your kid won't lose it), and it comes with an extra straw in the package. Good choice.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",Product information was very accurate and unit works as described.  Unit is very sturdy.  I have used it to replace a wooden unit,5
"Graco Travel Lite Crib with Bassinet, Marlowe",I bought this when my second daughter was born because she wouldn't sleep well in the bassinet that rocks because it would move every time she did.  She slept well in the bassinet feature as a newborn and we still use it when we travel and she is now turning one.  She is starting to get a little snug....  It was also nice because it is a little smaller than the normal Pack and Play so I was able to keep it set up in my bedroom.  The only problem I had was that it didn't fold up as nicely as our other pack n play but it is doable.  This is a great purchase for parents expecting a new baby.  It is a bassinet and travel system all in one!,4
Glass Table and Shelf Corner Cushions,"These corner cushions are an absolute waste. We put them on our coffee table one morning and by mid-morning, our 9 month old had managed to pull them all off. I tried sticking them back on but they flop off at the slightest touch. In fact, tonight, my daughter fell into the coffee table and knocked the ""corner protector"" off on her way down, catching her lip before she hit the floor. Ouch! We would have been better off not having the false security of these dumb things.",1
"Delta Children's Products Natural 4 in 1 Crib, Natural",My son and I put this together for my Granddaughter and the only issue I had was that when I rubbed my hand down part of the wood...I got a huge splinter!  I am just glad that it happened to me and not the baby!!  Other than that the crib is really nice and was very easy to assemble!!,4
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",so much easier than holding two shields and bottles while pumping!  I own 2 of them now so I always have a clean one (I do drop milk on it when I remove the shields).,5
"Vital Baby Toddler Straw Cup, 10 Ounce - 2 Pack (Pink/Orange)",Son loves this cup! Finally we found one that he can't take the straw out of! And with really only one piece to take off and clean I think this was a great buy.,5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink",Very good works at it claims I totally like it my daughter love the colors and it is safe for her,5
Eddie Bauer Classic Wood Swing,"My son is almost 15 weeks now.  He loves the swing and we use it on the highest speed since we start him in it.  The motor just failed on us.  I would not buy this swing again.  The straps are to hard to use and aren't removable for cleaning.  We don't use the straps.  It is bulky to take with you.  The tray is ok.  Nice looking but it needs to work.  Shoddy workmanship on the motor.The music stops if you hold the button in, just like the swing button.  If anyone knows how to get a hold of the manufactuer, please post it.Dave",1
Baby Safe Ink Print Kit - Basic,"I just used this on my 5 month old son and the feet turned out great.  The hands turned out pretty nice too, even though he wanted to touch everything with his inked up hands.",4
"Gerber Washcloth Set (Light Cream, Dark Cream, Blue, Orange, Green), 10-Count","These are of nice quality. They are soft and even after washing them numerous times, they are still soft. Would recommend them to my friends.",5
Wimmer Ferguson Wimmer Infant Stim Mobile To Go,"This is a very basic little mobile. We have it clipped to the grab bar in the backseat of our car over the infant carseat. This is a great place for it because it gives my girl something to look at, while it doesn't interfere with her safety in the event of a collision. The mobile is so lightweight that if for some reason the clip came undone (which seems impossible), the entire thing falling on her would not cause any injury. When I drive the mobile gently bounces around and keeps her very happy. Another great way we use it is to unclip it from the car and then clip it onto the carseat bar when she needs a little bit of entertainment when out and about in the stroller or at a store.",5
"Clevamama ClevaFoam Baby Pillow, Cream",It soft and material appears to be excellent. We believe that our baby is happy with it. So we love itFive stars for Amazon as usual,5
"Sale: 80 Piece (2 Set) Non-toxic foam Wonder Blocks for Children w/ Carry Totes: Soft, Quality, Bright Safe &amp; Quiet",I had these foam blocks in my house from years ago and needed to order some for grandchildren. They love to build and when they decide to throw them nobody gets hurt.,5
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss 4 Count Spill-Proof Trainer Sippy Cups with Removable Handles, 7 Ounce","My daughter and nephew LOVE the cups! Easy to use, durable, and colorful! Have the item for a few months now, and no complaints",5
"Stars &amp; Stripes Green, Organic Muslin Swaddling Blankets 2 Pack","I bought the Green Swirls Bambino Land Organic Muslin Swaddling Blankets (gave a 5 star review) and ordered these because I loved my first purchase so much.However, the quality on these Stars & Stripes ones are terrible compared to the Green Swirls.  When I first took it out, it didn't even feel like muslin, more like linen, it was so stiff.  I should've returned it then and there, instead, I decided to give it a wash in hopes that it would soften up because I LOVE all of my other organic Bambino land products (crib sheets, burp cloths, swaddling  blankets).  I've washed them about 15-20 times now, and it's only beginning to feel somewhat softer, but it does not feel the same as the green swirls.  When I hold them side by side, the green swirls blankets looks like it has a higher thread count.  Shame on Bambino for cutting corners.",2
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,"My 4 month old loves this, the music entertains him and he likes to lay on his back and swat at the toys.  I can see him using this as he grows.  It's well made and the music variety is great, a must have!!",5
"Summer Infant Sure and Secure Bedrail, White",it was a pain to put together.  all though it does work for what i needed it for.  but baby still not in big boy bed.,3
"Rumble Tuff Single Electric Breast Pump, Easy Express",comes with more than is shown however it includes everything listed in the description bar. it pumps easily an effectively in a very quick amount of time and has several different adjustment speeds. i am an at home mom so i usually breast feed but use the pump whenever i need my fiance to feed or to give my breast a break so the single pump works fine for myself.,4
"Lorex BB2411 2.4&quot; Sweet Peek Video Baby Monitor with IR Night Vision and Zoom, White","Clear picture but range could be better, thus the missing star. I had to go around house to see where range ended which was a bummer.",4
Munchkin Sesame Street Fresh Food Feeder,"Seriously. My baby boy of 8 months will eat anything and put anything in his mouth, except for this. He loves fruits and we always watch him very carefully every millisecond he does so. It gets difficult so we bought this. Luckily I just bought one, because normally I just buy things in multiples to make it easier on me later.I'm sure it's a good product, and it's a good concept, but don't have high expectations.",3
Safety 1st Finger Pinch Guard,I actually use this to keep the door open to the room where we keep the cat's litter box. Its a subtle product and keep guests from closing the door.,5
Fisher-Price bConnect Digital Soother,"My baby likes this soother, except it will turn off after 10 minutes which means if she isn't quite asleep yet she will start crying. The remote is nice to have except it only turns the soother on and off. It should be able to change the screen too. Music selection and brightness controls are nice to have. Overall, worth $90, but falls short of my expectations.",3
Bright Starts Snuggle Teether,"We have purchased the elephant version of the Snuggle teether as add-on gifts for at least three baby showers.  My grand-daughter (now 9 months old) loves hers. When she was younger, she liked to crinkle the tummy section.  Now she is more interested in gnawing on the feet.  This teether is soft enough for pre-teething babies to cuddle and lightweight enough for them to hang on to it by themselves.",5
NUK Mash &amp; Serve Bowl,I make my own baby food and this mash and serve bowl is a total lifesaver.  I think I need another one actually!  I use it to mash up avocados or bananas and it works really well and is so easy to use.,5
Especially for Baby Stroller Umbrella,I like that you can shade your baby from the sun from the sides. But the grip for the umbrella is very small and doesn't fit the Graco stroller well at all.,3
"Re-Play Divided Plates, Aqua, Green, Orange, 3-Count","We probably have 4 or 5 different brands of plates (Munchkin, Tupperware, Nuby) and these are by far the best!  They stack together nicely and have nice deep compartments for foods.  They wash up well in the dishwasher.  We will probably start getting rid of all our other plates and just keep these, wish we would have bought them first.",5
Munchkin Deluxe Drying Rack,"Love this rack.  I am using Dr. Brown bottles and this rack fits all the parts perfectly for 4 bottles.  Actually thinking about getting another Munchkin deluxe drying rack.  My baby is starting to drink more now.  I tried to fit 5 Dr. Brown bottles on this rack once, but it was too crowded with all of the bottle parts.  Took too long for all of the parts to dry.",5
Cloud b Polar Cuddle Bear Sleep Aid - Gently Shivers For Comforting Touch,We tried this little bear for a child that was having separation anxiety at night.He has been doing much better sleeping since he's had the Cloud B Polar Cuddle Bear.,5
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","These were exactly what I was looking for.  They held together great while we used them on our ""bucket"" car seat.  They kept the straps off of our daughters neck and gave her a little extra pillow to take a nap on.  We got lots of complements on how cute they are.  We'll use them for our next baby, as long as its a girl, otherwise I'll just order the blue ones!!!  They wash up great in the washing machine too...",5
Playtex Diaper Genie Essentials Diaper Disposal Pail,"This is by far a 100% improvement over the original diaper genie.  No odor, easy to change, no twisting.  This thing is perfect.  We just bought a 2nd one for our newborn's room.  This is a must buy!",5
Versatile Play Pen - Large (16 pieces),"Works as intended. Provides ample space for a toddler. Easy to assemble. We combined it with a foam floor mattress, which works great. The connections work well when mounting them the first time. I think that they may  become looser over time if the playpen is assembled and disassembled a few times.",4
NoJo Little Bedding  Jungle Time 4 Piece Crib Set,"This set appears to be the cheaper version of the Jungle Babies set.NoJo Jungle Babies 6 Piece Crib Bedding SetThat one is 100% cotton and more than twice the price. The good news is that this one is still cute and you can mix and match with the Jungle Babies separate pieces (sheets, valance, lamp, etc) most of the pieces of that one match this one pretty well. The sheet that comes with this set is pretty thin and scratchy.",4
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda Veloce Stroller, Mint Java","This stroller is very poorly made. The wheels are cheap and it's hard to fold. Save your money, not worth the buy!!!",1
Preemie / Bassinet Wedge,Our daughter was not comfortable at all with this. The nap nanny worked much better (until she was old enough to try and get out).  For infants (with breathing issues that require a thirty degree angle or for reflux- our daughter had both) go with the nap nanny instead. This was a waste of money.,1
"Bedtime Originals Champ Snoopy Musical Mobile, Blue",Very cute mobile that goes great with the matching crib set [...]. The reason I gave this product 4 stars instead of 5 is because the plastic is rather cheap and somewhat flimsy. However it serves it purposes and like I said looks great.,4
SnugZee Baby Head Support Neck Stabilizer Car Seat Pillow - Prism,"My son's head will still fall forward when he falls asleep.  It is a nice cushion for his head side-to-side, though. I just think that there really is not a product out there that will prevent the baby's head from falling forward in car seat.  :)",3
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","My husband used to work for a company that ran a pregnancy magazine, and we received a few of these, in different sizes and materials (glass and plastic), free. I don't remember which we used first - I think it was a 4oz glass one - but it was brilliant, so we went out and bought lots more recently, when baby started eating 6oz in one feed.They are AWFUL. The vent retains that nasty old-formula smell, even when they've been rinsed, cleaned in a dishwasher, and sterilised. I've never known bottles leak like these do. They are constantly sticky because they leak so badly that formula goes everywhere. My husband used to be a weightlifter, and even his vice grip tightening the collars down doesn't stop leaks.And the lids never even stay on! I went out yesterday with these in my diaper bag, and the lids kept popping off with the slightest pressure applied to the sides (such as when my diaper bag brushed against my hip while I was walking) - it's ridiculous!We bought a set of 4oz Evenflo bottles, 3 for $5, and they're ten times better than these pieces of junk. Maybe the glass ones will be better, but the plastic are certainly a total waste of money.",1
"Fisher-Price Cradle n Swing, My Little Lamb","life saver for us!  our little one naps in it 3-4 times/day. When she wakes up, i turn on the music and mobile - keeps her entertained for at least 20 more minutes!",5
"Contigo Bpa-free Kids Autoseal Mugs 9 Oz, Green","My grandchildren love drinking out of these mugs/cups, and my daughter and I love it when they do. These mugs are easy for an older child to use -- starting at 3-4, I'd say -- and they don't spill! Well, if they were to hold the mug upside down while pushing in the button, it would. But if they drop it or throw it or leave it sitting somewhere and the cat knocks it over -- then it does not spill. I've even carried them in bags when they were full and they didn't spill. I've given them to other mothers and they love them too! This isn't just a travel mug; it's an all the time mug.As for the green one -- my grandsons fight over who gets the green ones!",5
"Kushies On The Go Snack Bag, Blue Square, Small","I was unsure what size I wanted to get because this was my first replacement towards disposable plastic zip-lock bags (yay!). I went with the largest size they had because the bigger the better, right? There was no harm in getting a size too big, but too small would have a problem fitting my sandwiches.When I got it, it was the right size for me. I'm a high school student who brings a simple lunch to school: a regular sized sandwich, a capri sun, and perhaps a bag of chips or dried fruit. Those three things all fit snugly into the Kushies and I was so satisfied.If you're contemplating your choice based on the reviews that say it barely holds anything, just get the largest size possible. It won't hurt you. After all, a little extra room doesn't hurt.By the way, the color is gorgeous and the material shows potential to endure the next four years of college. Definitely machine-washable and I recommend, if putting a sandwich in, you should saran wrap it first. That's what I do to keep it clean!",5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,I am soo disappointed in this product! Especially for the cost of the unit and the refills. I've had the Diaper Dekor Plus for 3 months now and I hate it! It smells like deodorizer PLUS diaper! It's so gross. The only thing it has going for it is it's sleek look (fooled me). Don't waste your money.,1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I wanted something simple so after looking around in the store my husband and I chose this for our baby registry.For the most part, it works great.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because filling the tube with the amount of water ""supposedly"" required isn't entirely accurate.  Sometimes we'd put the appropriate water and it wouldn't heat enough.  On the other hand, there are times we wait until the unit tells us the unit is warm and it's super HOT!  That is defitnely a warning--it doesn't just warm the bottle.  Sometimes it really HEATS it up.I just recently also started using the baby food jar warmer attachement and that works great.This product is compact so it won't take up a lot of room (something that was very important to me because I live in an apartment) and cleans very well.  The cord, however, is not long at all so you'll have to put it close to the outlet unless you can use an extension cord.  It's great for quick fixes though.  The bottle does not take long at all to heat whether large or small.A good product.  It is durable and I know will last me for other children I may have.",4
CTA Digital 2-in-1 iPotty with Activity Seat for iPad,"This is a great product. While I poo, I can download the ipoo app and see what my poo is telling me about my health, then I can share the info on FB, twitter and upload best poos to instagram to let all my friends, family and followers know what is going on. I've already gotten 5,378 likes. Great wrap around product.",5
Lamaze Morgan the Monkey Play and Grow,too cute was looking for a carseat toy for my friends baby definately got a great toy......... ...... ....... ...,5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","bought the stroller because i have to go spend a few days in downtown atlanta with just the kids, and i don't really want to struggle with a cranky toddler just because i only have one stroller. had it delivered within two days (ordered sunday night, delivered by tuesday afternoon). unfortunately the package was missing a rear wheel hardware kit and a manual. the stroller itself is easy enough to assemble without the manual, but the missing hardware makes the stroller pretty much useless, as i can't stroll without the back wheels falling off the axle every so often.since it was already past 5pm i emailed the customer service via their website, and got a response early wed morning. the rep (Dave) promised me to overnight expedite the kit so I can receive it before I go. Unfortunately I leave in the morning and there is no way it can reach me before i go. I applaud the quick response and effort though.The stroller itself is great. it's heavier than standard plastic stroller since it's made of steel. when folded is pretty compact. I can put it sideways and fit with it a big suitcase, a carry on, 2 backpacks and a bunch of other shopping finds in my car trunk (chrysler aspen, back seat folded). with both kids on the stroller it's pretty easy to steer, although the heaviness makes it feel like i'm using a brand new shopping cart. i can ever steer easily while holding baby in my hand and my bigger kid sitting on the stroller. both kids are happy. yes, your bigger kid can't sit if the front seat is reclined. and yes, you can't get to the bottom storage if your kid is sitting on the bench, but i don't mind. no parent cup holder, yes that's a bummer. but i can always buy a separate attachment, i think. what i most like is it's compact and maneuverable (i can stroll in and out of tiny spaces easily).overall i haven't used the stroller for an extensive time, but at a glance i'm happy with the purchase. great customer service too.",4
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,"I've been obsessed with making my own baby food AND buying premade baby food in pouches (You know for those times you just have to grab and go).  With my homemade baby food, it's usually not practical to put the cubes in a container and bring it with you.  I started researching reusable pouches for those weekend errand days where I can feed the baby food I've made.  These work perfectly!  I usually put a couple of cubes in the pouch a day before and leave it in the fridge.  The ziplock seal on top is really tight and even when i fold up the bottom and squeeze the last drops out, it doesn't open.  I've been recommending these to everyone!",5
Philips Avent DECT Baby Monitor with Temperature Sensor and Night Mode,"We had a high priced video monitor but returned it as it wasn't much useful. Got the Philips Avent audio monitor and it works flawlessly. The video monitor had to be couple of times a day while this one goes on for couple of days on a single charge! The audio is as good as the one on digital phone. Very crisp and DECT doesn't interfere with WiFi or other systems. The night light has a warm soft glow. The monitor connects flawlessly and very quickly. Haven't tested the range much but works pretty well a block or two down.Be careful If you bring the remote close to the base it gives out a screeching noise which might wake up the baby. While switching off the remote, it makes a light sound which can't be classified as annoying or irritating.Overall, the product is awesome and would surely recommend if your primary concern is audio clarity than viewing the baby!",5
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink","My two and half year old is potty training, and this extender has really made his hand washing go faster.",5
"Bummis Super Brite Diaper Cover, Pink, 8-16 Pounds","I love the way this cover fits my 6-week old, but after only having it for less than a month (I ordered it exactly a month ago), the laminated material has separated from the fabric.  With a couple more washes, it will most likely tear and then the cover will start to leak.  I'm very disappointed in the quality here.",1
"Gerber Birdseye 10 Count Flatfold Cloth Diapers, White","These diapers are very thin, but that is what I like about them. I use them as dishcloths. The thin fabric makes it easier to dry all the nooks and crannies of the clean dishes.",5

Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer MODEL# TAT-2000C,This is very fast.  Love that it does not need probe covers.  Not very big and fits easily in my bag for taking with me where I need to go.,5
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"I ordered this Graco pack n' play to replace one that I had that I was very satisfied with. Unfortunately, they were not exactly the same. The mattress is not as sturdy as my other one and my daughter is constantly lifting it up and bending it back and even sitting under it. Don't know why this one is of lesser quality and not quite sure why one differs from the other but they did. The rest of it is ok, the colors were nice and soft.",3
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"We liked that this was a single unit that had rails for both sides. Assembly was slightly more complicated than expected, but still took under 15 minutes. It has worked as advertised, and we have been pleased with the product.",4
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat in MatrixThis is the best seat! I love the 3 in 1, the fact it harnesses longer than most seats, and that it later will transition into the booster seat. My son loves his new seat and calls it his ""race car"" seat b/c of it's design. I'd highly recommend this seat to anyone with a child about to outgrow the convertable seats that only harness up to 40 lbs. Extended rear facing and extended harnessing is the safest way! I will be buying this same seat for my daughter as soon as she's big enough for it!",5
Jolly Jumper Musical Play Mat,"My daughter likes this a little, mostly to look at the colors I think. There isn't that many sounds and they are only right in the center of it, so it doesn't provide a ton of stimulation. Would be cooler if it lit up and how more sounds.",3
"Badger Basket Baby Changing Table with Six Baskets, Black","This product is ok I guess for the price. You get what you pay for. It is a frame, with no sides or bottom or back. The drawers are fabric with a cardboard (fabric covered) bottom. There are just laying on the frame, but there is no stop that will impede them to be completely pulled off the frame - either front or back.Our dresser came with two screws that were too short for their intended use - happily we had enough hardware at home to finish assembly.It also came woth a horrible smell. We put it i. The garage to offgas, but after a week, it was still smelling. After it stopped raining, we started putting the different parts outside one by one - this is when we diacovered that the smelly part was actually the flimsy plastic changing mattress. Given that we have no use for it (we already have a changing pad that we purchased separately and intend to use in the dresser), we just discarded it.",3
"Munchkin Baby Food Grinder, Light Blue",I had one of these 20 years ago but stupidly gave it away. This one holds more baby food but the handle you turn on top is attached to the baby food grinder and is very hard to put in place and it won't stay in place.  So your grinding and it keeps falling off.  It is not easy to use and is very messy.,3
"Dappi Waterproof 100% Nylon Diaper Pants, 2 Pack, White, Small",I've very surprised that this actually keeps everything inside.  I thot for sure it would leak but it doesn't.  Seems to hold up well in the washer.,5
"Baby Trend Deluxe Playard, Provence",Awesome playard. I bought it for 139$ on walmart. Don't buy it here at 252$ it is completely crazy when you can purchase it for 139$ at walmart.,5
Baby Trend Universal Double Snap-N-Go Stroller Frame,everything is good but you can not get in the bottom when 2 car seats are on top. but this product does not suck and the price is not bad compared to any other twin strollers.,4
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Sky Blue High Chair,"I really liked this chair even though I just returned the one I bought.The positives are:1)the frame is well constructed.2)the cushion is very beautiful to look at.3)and the table with its pop out dishwasher safe tray is a really cool feature.The 2 negatives are:1)the foot rest could not be installed properly. It looks like an engineering glitch.2)the rollers seem to be kind of cheap and don't really roll well, even when you disengage the break levers.",2
BABYBJORN Bib for Baby Carrier 2 Pack - White,"This bib is not soft enough and  after a couple of trips with it my son's cheeks were bright red from friction. What I do, I use it as a cover for the carrier, so I do not have to wash the carrier itslef, but I also use a big Aden and Anais bamboo burpy bib between it and my baby's chin and cheeks for softness. This combination works wonders for us and even if the burpy bib gets soiled and is removed for a little while I am replacing it, my baby carrier is still protected from drooling and milk.",2
Kidkusion Hearth Kushion Taupe,"I have a sandstone stacked fireplace.  I knew this or any other type adhesive probably wouldn't work and it really doesn't.  It does stick a little and I was even surprised with that.  Overall, a great product.  People don't even notice it because it matches the grout perfectly.  I may try caulking it down if my little one starts pulling at it.  I couldn't find that DAP product in any hardware store (Seal and Peel), so I may just try adhesive caulk.",5
"Diono RadianR100 Convertible Car Seat, Dune","Just what everyone says about it, sturdy (HEAVY!), Narrow form, comfortable, awesome latches - if you can afford it, buy it! (3rd kid before i could afford it and cosco seats did just fine)",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"I love this hammock. I remember having similar ones when I was younger and now I get to put on in my child's nursery! It's huge and holds TONS of stuffed animals. Seriously, this things is packed and it can hold a lot more. It's now one of my favorite parts of the room :)Very easy to put up, will be easy to take down as well.I love it, I would recommend this to anyone and I will probably order another one soon.",5
Baby Clear Cut Nail Clipper Pigeon (new yellow color Made in Japan),"These nail clippers are of superb quality.  Perfectly sized and precision aligned, the sharp cutting edges make easy work of trimming your baby's nails.  If the alignment were poor, they wouldn't work.  Dull edges and they would tear or imperfectly cut.  These clippers have neither defect.  Try them.  You'll learn that Pigeon makes quality baby items.  You'll not be disappointed.",5
"WallStickersUSA Contemporary Wall Sticker Decal, Tree Branches, Leaves, Lovebirds, and Hearts, X-Large",Love this on my wall. Just a lot of separate pieces. Little time consuming but worth it.,4
My Little Pony Drink Bottle,Great drinking bottle for my four year old.  she loves my little pony and it is a good price. The lid has yet to fall off which is a plus.,5

"Munchkin 2 Pack Sesame Street Insulated Spill-Proof Cup, 9 Ounce, Colors May Vary","I brought this same Munchkin product at another store, and for some reason these seem way smaller. I don't dislike them and they seem functional.",1
Kirby 4 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set by Glenna Jean,"I searched all over for baby girl bedding that wasn't a wash of pepto fru-fruness ... this set fit the bill. Loved the bright colors and bold print. The only reason I didn't give this set 5 stars was because I was slightly disappointed that the material used was kind of rough and canvas-like. In case anyone is wondering like I was, the back of the blanket is a creme colored fleece, and that part is quite soft. The construction is excellent, and the quilt squares have reinforced stitching in the corners - nice touch. I have no doubt that this set would last through several hand-me-downs.",4
"Carters Cushysoft Blanket, Blue","If you buy this blanket, whatever you do, DO NOT FOLLOW THE WASH INSTRUCTIONS ON THE TAG. Despite the fact that it says &#34;Tumble dry&#34;, I am convinced it was meant to be line dried. I washed and dried mine according to the instructions and it came out rough and incredibly linty instead of the soft silkiness it had been before. Some of the fibers seemed almost melted. It was not a case of the drier being too hot; I had two other soft blankets in the same load and they came out just as soft as when they went in. I will be writing to the company about this.",1
"Green Eats 4 Pack Feeding Spoons and Forks , Yellow","Got these for my 13 month old son to use since he needed some toddler size utensils, these are made by Green Toys brand, which we love. They are a lot tinier than I expected though, maybe 3 inches long? I guess they are baby sized, but I thought they would be a tad larger... the quality seems to be great though!",4
babyletto Modo 5-Drawer Dresser in Espresso/White,I chose this dresser because it is modern and simple in appearance.  I assumed that for $400 the quality would match the price.  A year later the sides are bowing and the drawers are falling out.  It looks terrible and has become un-usable.  The dresser has not been overloaded or anything of the sort.  The quality is just simply terrible.  No not buy this dresser.  I am debating whether to attempt to re-inforce and stabilize it or just throw it out.  I am very upset by this purchase.Update:  Afer complaining to Babyletto they have sent me a new dresser.  I was impressed by their willingness to stand by their product and try to correct the issue.  Will report about how the replacement holds up.,2
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","We bought two different baby baths before trying this product, and I wish we had just skipped to this. You don't have to worry about the baby sliding, or fitting into the right spot, plus other baby baths keep them up out of the water. With this product, you have complete control over how submerged your child is. My son is 4.5 months old, and we've been using this for about 2.5 months. He is much more comfortable and relaxed on this pillow than he ever was in a baby bath or the sink. It's perfect for us because we have a small house and small bathroom, and it doesn't take up much room. If you don't squeeze as much water out as you can before you hang it to dry, yes it gets a little mildew-smelling but no big deal. After using daily for a few months, the fabric that holds the plastic hangar is starting to unravel but I would guess we'll be able to use it for a year or so before we need to try to repair or replace. It was a great deal.",5
"green sprouts Safari Friends Backpack, Yellow Lion",Got this for my grandson 2 and half yrs old and my daughter says its too cute and has enough room for a toddler's essentials! He loves to wear it on his back per mom.,5
Safety 1st Baby's 1st Deluxe Healthcare and Grooming Kit,"The product itself is good. The kit has all the neccessary items. However, I did not recieve the product that is in the seller's picture. The color of the pouch was green, not blue. Not a huge deal, but I like to recieve the product that is advertised.",3
"Angelcare Baby Sound Monitor, White","I love this baby monitor. I bought this monitor because I was seriously going to throw the previous one out the window or in the garbage shoot because the static, not the baby, was keeping me up all night!This monitor is practically static free. In the five months i've owned it i have only heard static once. it's cute, has a night light, and the rechargeable battery lasts a long time off of the charger.This monitor has been a life saver. Please buy it if your looking for a baby monitor. you'll be glad you got it.",5
"Carter's 5 Year Baby Memory Book, Woodland",This was an absolute great gift!  I was completely satisfied with this item.  The book had many features that was an absolute hit.,5
"Under The Nile Pull Over Bib, Ice Blue Snail","Under The Nile is a GREAT brand! Our family has never been disappointed with any of their products. However, we do wish they had more toddler sized items.Nevertheless, these bibs are wonderful. We've bought several different brands on Amazon such as I-Play, Green Sprouts, BabySoy, and even other Under The Nile bibs. These our probably our favorite.They pull over the head like a T-Shirt-- no snaps or buttons, and the coverage is quite ample. They fit our two years old well and the quality is superb. Considered giving four instead of five stars due to the price-- they're expensive-- but figure you get what you pay for.Our little girl wears this bib A LOT-- and not just at meals! Just got back from a trip to Whole Foods. She insisted on wearing it to the grocery store! C'mon, what more could you want??",5
Baby Spa Hypoallergenic Ultra Soft Wipes with Aloe,"These are the best and most cost effective wipes out there.  They are thicker and stronger than most of the popular wipes, which comes in handy for some of those messier diaper changes.  They are also strong enough to clean up major spills and messes that my babies make.  And all for a very reasonable cost.  Thanks for making them available to me, and with free shipping.  Who could ask for more?",5

"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","I absolutely love this stroller.  It is very sturdy and easy to maneuver.  It is a great buy for the price.  I would have payed a lot more for this stroller, it is that good!",5
Fisher-Price Zen Collection Cradle Swing,"We started out with a travel swing for our baby---not a good idea.  She was never a fan of it so I was very hesitant to spend more money on a full size swing.  I went forward with getting one because I needed some type of relief---a place to rest the baby other than her crib. We purchased this swing when our daughter was 3 months old (now 7 months).  I wish I had purchased it sooner than 3 months--this would have been a wonderful thing to have when coming home from the hospital!  This swing is beautiful and fits our decor well. In the past we used a regular baby swing with our son which is not the same as a cradle swing--this has more of a papasan chair seat which seems way more comfortable.  I love the fact that the music is soft and that there are several music/sound options--it's not the loud irritating music that most baby stuff is equipped with.  The fact that the swing can swing back to front as well as side to side is also a great feature. I love that this swing can be plugged in--no batteries needed (though you can use batteries if you like)!!The lowest speed setting is a bit faster than you would expect so as others have stated in previous reviews, weighing down the swing with a blanket does the trick. Once the baby is no longer a ""newborn"" then a blanket is not needed to weigh down the seat.  I love the fact that you can remove the seat from the frame and take it into another room without disturbing the baby--again another reason why I wish I had purchased this immediately upon my daughter's birth.  The built-in fold over blanket is cute, however it is not adequate to keep a baby warm---totally more of a neat feature rather than providing sufficient warmth. I always layer the baby with one of her soft, cuddly blankets when she is in the swing--she seems to love it. And I am surprised at how much the baby seems to still like the mobile that hangs above her head--it's been 4 months and I still catch her glancing at it.  This swing features a good amount of variety when it somes down to music, swinging direction, and the ability to remove the seat altogether. The colors are almost a pea green, dark brown (almost espresso) and burgandy--it's beautiful.We chose this swing because of the style and because of the seat being different than the traditional swing seat.  I also like that there is not a tray on this swing like some swings have--I like that my daughter uses the swing to rest and not to play and bang around--if there was a tray she'd be distracted from laying back.  I use her walker and stationary entertainer for when she needs some action--we use the swing for quiet rest time. I hope to use this swing if we have more children in the future--it was well worth the price and I would recommend this to anyone that doesn't want a traditional swing or to anyone who is looking to get a very comfortable, top of the line swing.  If you are not a fan of pastel colors and want a nice looking unisex swing that also happens to be comfortable, functional, and safe go for this one!  It's pricer than some swings but as much as we've used it, it's been well worth it.  If you have a small space however, I would not recommend this swing--it is larger and takes up a good amount of room due to the fram being wide at the bottom.",5
"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack Limited Edition PINK",These are awesome!!i put these on my stroller the day I received them in the mail and I have no intentions of taking them off!!!!

"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Sweater Knit Blanket, Celery/Gray ZigZag","Make sure to read the measurements on this one: it's 30x30, like a small receiving blanket. If the size suits you, this is a very nice blanket for various temperatures. It's very soft, and I found that it does fine in a low heat dryer. I would not recommend a baby blanket that had to be air-dried, that's just not practical.It's plush, but because it's cotton knit, it's not overly warm. It says sweater knit, which is vague. This is thicker, softer yarn than the thermal blankets, but the knit is finer than what I think of when I hear &#34;sweater.&#34; It's soft and fuzzy but doesn't seem too prone to snags or unravelling.This is particularly nice since so many of the softest baby blankets now are fuzzy boa-style fabrics that can just be too hot.",4
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe WrapSack Blanket, Woof Woof, Large",We started using these when our 4 month old started rolling over at night. They are perfect! His arms are free for him to reposition himself but he still has a cover and they are easy to put on! They are a regular fixture in our sleep routine.,5

"Fisher-Price Little, Laugh, and Learn Shop 'N Learn Cart Cover",I purchased this cart cover for my one year old. We have the Floppy cover for my first child( whose two) but i liked this one because it comes with an activity tray toy that can entertain her while we shop. The extra pockets on the side make it easy to store snakes or sippy cups too. Glad that i bought it.,4
Russ Berrie 8&quot; SNOWMAN SET of 2 Beanies with Christmas Hat &amp; Scarf,"My toddler like them very much. I give him one of the toys and he takes it with himself all the time. Once it is dirty, I put it to washing mechine and give the other one to him.",4

"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet",I bought this for my 4 month old niece.  She seems to enjoy it and it encourages her to reach.  My sister-in-law says it really entertains the baby while she is cleaning the house and the baby isn't sleeping.  The baby prefers the music and it's great to have the remote control so that she can restart the music without the baby seeing her.,5

Born Free Stage 3 Silicone Nipples- 6 Pack,"Stage 3 from Born is perfect for 5-6mo old baby. You will be able to mix 2Tbs of your favorite cereal into 6oz of mixed formula, and the nipple will have no problems with clogging. Cereals tried with this nipple at 2tbs ratio: rice, oatmeal.I am pleased with how it performs and washing (dishwasher). We used Born from stage 1-3.",5

my first fish bowl by lamaze / learning curve,"This toy was given to my son by his grandmother.  I saw Lamaze and immediately thought it would be a great toy.  Not the case.My son received this fish bowl when he was about 4 months old.  He is now 9 months.  He chews on the crab for hours, but other than that not much else.  I feel that this is an expensive teething toy.I like the variety of color and the different textures of fabric the toy offers.",2
"Chicco Ct0.6 Capri Lightweight Stroller, Red","It was a good purchase for us. It's very cute and stylish with the features of the more expensive umbrella strollers.  My 25 pound 15 month old thinks it's more comfortable than his Graco Metrolite.  He was very happy to be pushed around in it and helped me pick it out. I'm 5'4"""" so I find it pretty manuverable and comfortable to push.  I'm even learning how to push it with one hand.  It's very very easy to close and open.  It fits perfectly into my CR-V (but so does everything else).  It has a sturdy and durable feel to it.  I love how it folds up and you can sling it over your shoulder. My boy is very active and loves to walk so this helps keep my hands free when I run after him.",5

Disney Cars Toddler Fitted Sheet,Three stars because the design is really cute on these sheets but the colors have faded a bit after just one wash.  Additionally the fabric and pretty rough.  They may soften a bit as we wash them more but for now they don't seem like they will be very comfy on our son's toddler bed.,3
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White",Have enjoyed it for the last 9 and half months. Need to make sure not to fill it too much but there is a line to show you.,5

Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up,"My daughter was terrified to use the potty.  This potty seat made her feel safer because her feet were grounded and she had handles to hold onto.  Also, this potty seat makes it easy for little boys to pee standing up.  I would recommend this seat.",5

Full Coverage all-in-one Hands-Free Pumping Bra &amp; Nursing Tank by Rumina Nursingwear - Black Large,"Love these tanks! No other hands free option truly works for me like this one.  For me, this works so much better than the popular hands free bra.Often the other hands-free pumping options left me with no suction :/I have been using these tanks since starting back to work--and still successfully pumping at work/nursing at home--and little one is 8 months old now.  I always feel better pumping/nursing with a tank on...so it  kills two birds with one stone and also allows me to be prepared at work and ready to pump without any extra gear or much to maneuver.  I can even pump in the car if needed and feel the tank allows plenty of privacy.  I would hate not having this tank!Thanks for a great product!",5

"Philips AVENT Soft Spout Magic Cup, 9 Ounce, Twin, Color May Vary","My son was a breast fed baby exclusively for 10months, then he cut teeth and decided that he wanted to bite. Well, that just wasn't gong to happen. He would take a sippy cup just fine for juices and such, and had been from about 5months, but when it came down to drinking milk, the sippy cup idea didn't seem to appeal to him, nor did the bottle. Then I got him one of the Avent Magic cups.....he loved it, and still, at 2years of age, it's the only cup that he will drink milk from. We never had a problem will spilling/leaking, infact, the only problem that I have is you can't find the Avent line locally where I live.",5

The Peepee Teepee for the Sprinkling WeeWee: 5 Airplanes in Cellophane Bag,"This is a very cute and fun item, but not functional at all. This could be a good silly shower gift, but the reality is that it doesn't work. It's impossible to hold the peepee teepee in place while changing the baby. Once baby squirms the teepee falls right off. Takes more energy to try to keep the teepee in place, than to just quickly change the baby.",2
Dapper Snappers Adjustable Toddler Belt with Add-on Clips Included (Cupcakes),"My daughter is a petite little one, and at her age a belt is nearly impossible, especially when considering potty training. Easy access to use the potty is crucial at 3 1/2 years old. I've used other belts, but I ended up cleaning up a mess instead. With these, I can clip these on to a tutu, holding her pants and any other type of dress without loops up without any fuss. I just clip these on daily, and she can still use the potty by herself without any assistance from me.My daughter is getting taller, but she isn't getting any &#34;fatter&#34;, thus the need for a belt. I have total of 3, two black and one purple and they are the best invention ever! My petite little princess can wear pants without issues of them falling down or needing to roll up legs or fold down pants. Now with wearing training pants, she doesn't have the extra padding of a diaper to hold up her pants, so it's even more of a challenge! This product has solved that issue completely!!",5
"Carter's Plush Security Blanket, Bear",My daughter has had her little bear blanket from birth and has now decided to make a bear bear family.  She loves these things.,5
"Pearhead Babyprints Desk Frame, Mahogany","This kit is fantastic!  I bought one previously in another store (light wood frame color) to use myself and loved it so much I bought this one for a friend who's due in a couple months. The imprint material is easy to work with, not at all messy and if you mess up, you can roll it out again and do it over. Note, you do have to PUSH your child's foot into the material fairly firmly, it's not a stamp and you can't simply touch it on the surface.  We did it while our baby was sleeping (less wiggling) and he didn't even wake up. The imprint material is actually a lightweight foam modeling material similar to stuff Crayola used to sell. The frame and matting are of good quality and all together, the kit makes a beautiful finished product that will be enjoyed for years to come.",5
Sassy Bathtime Pals Squirt and Float Toys,my 7 month old daughter just loves these in her tub at bathtime. they are the perfect size and are easy for her small hands to handle. they keep her occupied and she giggles when she gets squirted with them. they are easy to keep clean and she plays with them out of the tub as well. highly recommended!,5

"Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Standard Neck Bottle, 4 oz - 3-Pack","As with most things touted as a miracle cure for your baby, the hype is a bit overblown.  This bottle does help but doesn't end reflux altogether.My three-month-old daughter has had reflux issues since she was born.  She's almost exclusively breastfed, except for one or two bottles a day of expressed milk. I thought I'd give the Dr. Brown's bottles a go, after feeding her from Born Free and Medela bottles with no discernible difference in her spitting up.  With the Dr. Brown's bottles, we did find that she spits up slightly less.  Does she still spit up?  Sure -- just not quite as much.I wash these bottles in the dishwasher (top rack), and haven't had a problem with them leaking.  Yes, there are a number of pieces that have to be cleaned for each bottle, but there are no more pieces than the Born Free bottles, and in the dishwasher it's not a big deal.  And even the times I've washed them by hand, having to wash a few pieces and use the enclosed brush hasn't been onerous.  If she were exclusively bottle-fed and I didn't have a dishwasher, I can see where these bottles might seem like a pain, but otherwise they aren't that time-consuming.A lot of the comments on the Dr. Brown's bottles seem to come down to a question of parenting style.  If you're the type of parent who values convenience above all things because you're dealing with a needy baby, especially if you don't have a dishwasher, you may well dislike the Dr. Brown's bottles (my friends in this camp rave about the Playtex dropins).  If you're instead the type of parent who doesn't mind an extra minute or less loading the dishwasher and an extra 5 seconds in assembling a bottle, if it means your child with reflux will spit up a bit less, I recommend trying one of the Dr. Brown's bottles to see if it helps your baby.",4
"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer",This does exactly what it's supposed to do. Only con I can even think of is that it smells of plastic.,5
"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","I bought the security gate to prevent our Italian Greyhound from entering parts of the house in which we don't want him, and for that it's just fine.  My only comlaint is that there is no way to leave the gate open without it swinging shut.  Even a small bungee type device would be a good addition (and I'll probably figure out something on my own).",3

"EveryDay Willow Wool Dryer Balls Gift Set of 3, Natural","Maybe I got a defective set, but these dryer balls were a miserable failure for me. I was hoping to reduce drying time; instead, on every load I tried, drying time was at least tripled. In some cases it took more than three hours to dry a regular sized load of laundry. I thought maybe the dryer had broken, but my husband insisted we try a load without the laundry balls. Amazingly enough, we were back to our normal, original drying times.I am so unhappy I spent the money on these and so unhappy I cannot return them. Also please note these do not come with the basket that's shown in the picture.--Update--The dryer times slowed down again soon after I wrote this review. The dryer repairman checked and nothing was wrong with the dryer itself. It turned out that birds had built a nest in our dryer vent chase, partially using the wool from one of these balls that had partially disintegrated. So, it wasn't totally the dryer balls' fault.",1
"Evenflo Bebek 2 Count Bottle, 8 Ounce","I started my son on Dr. Brown's wide neck bottles which he always liked and did really well with but by the time he was about 6 months old I was so sick of hand-washing (no dishwasher) all those pieces that i started looking for alternatives.  Unfortunately, my son didn't want anything to do with any of the other bottles i tried.  I tried all different types including Avent but my little man was not having it.  I finally tried Bebek (now evenflo) and he didn't even seem to notice they were different bottles, the nipple is exactly the same size and softness.Bebek used to have a slightly different style of bottle that was more boring looking but personally i liked better and the cap wasn't such a pain to put on like these new ones are but i own and still use both styles.  They're terrific bottles especially if you're sick of washing dr. brown's.",5
Soho Spring Time Butterfly Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 14 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"It appeared as though it had a satin-like finish.  Exactly opposite.

"Graco My Ride 65 DLX Convertible Car Seat, Empire","After a great deal of research, we purchased this seat because we felt it was a good combination of safety and value. My husband and I both drive Ford Explorers (mine is a 2002 two-door sport, his is a full size 2010) so we didn't think the size would be an issue. It barely fit rear-facing in the center position of the 2010 explorer, and we felt like it took a great deal of effort to get a secure fit with the LATCH compared to our Chicco Key fit 30 infant seat. We are both relatively tall, and it would not have fit in either of the outboard positions AND accommodated our need for a little extra leg room in that vehicle. We tried to install it in the 2002 with a seat belt (not equipped with LATCH) and completely abandoned the effort after a half hour of sweating and swearing. It also barely fit in the back seat of that vehicle, and we couldn't get a secure fit with the older model seat belt. Again, we had no trouble achieving a secure fit with our Chicco Key Fit 30 with a seat belt installation in this vehicle. Once the seat was securely installed in the 2010 Explorer, we were not happy with the amount of flex in the top of the car seat. We wished it had a little more reinforcing at the top.The infant head rest did not want to stay in place because it did not actually attach to the seat, and we thought it was much more difficult to unbuckle the harness than it was in our Chicco seat.On the bright side, the fabric was breathable, and our hot-natured son stayed cool and comfortable during our trip.We would have returned it, but our son expressed his opinion of the seat by exploding a diaper on our trial outing. Yes, darling, Daddy and I think this seat is crap, too. Since we are fairly certain Amazon has a no-skidmark return policy, we laundered the cover and are planning to use it in my mother's LATCH-equipped sedan, in the center position, for the rare occasions she needs a car seat.",2
"Bumkins Pacifier Clip, Gazebo","We used these on mam pacifiers, but had to go through one of the air holes which the instructions said not to do. On one hand it was good that my son couldn't get his paci off this leash. On the other had it was a negative that we couldn't take the  paci off the leash without taking it out of his mouth which I would have liked to do when transferring my sleeping baby from his car seat to crib.We bought this to replace a mam leash but I might just try a new mam leash. I wonder if it was just stretched out.",4
"Boon Stem Grass and Lawn Drying Rack Accessory,Yellow",These are so handy to help out with drying bottles and parts. You won't be disappointed. We have a garden of these and love them!!!,5
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"I was under the impression that these would somehow fit into the horns that came with my medlea pump...no such luck! Just be sure to order the connectors (and vale/membrane).  Wish they made smaller, but I guess I just have tiny nipples!",4
"Animal Planet 2 Count Strap Covers, White Tiger","We got these to go on the 2nd car seat we finally caved and bought... They are cute but the ones that we got at target for the first seat were better quality and had velcro that ran the full vertical length of the strap cover. these just have one little square at the top and one little square at the bottom. The material is pretty thin too, but luckily these don't take a lot a heavy wear so I think we'll be ok!",3
Disney Princess and Me Canopy Bed Set -- 5-Pc.,"I purchased this product for my daughter and, after only an hour, put it back in the box for return.  The materials and construction is among the absolute worst of any toy I've purchased in recent memory.  The plastic head board and foot board snap into the side pieces but do not form a sturdy base.  Not that it matters because the actual ""mattress"" is simply a piece of thin corrugated cardboard with tabs that slide into the plastic headboard and foot board.  It barely supports the weight of the doll and gives no purchase for the stiff quilt that accompanies the bed. (And no, the bed spread does NOT hang down over the sides of the bed, rather it sticks out like airplane wings.)  As we were tying on the canopy, two of the ribbons used to secure the fabric to the bedposts came off in our hands.Save yourself the trouble and do not purchase this item.",1
Gerber Thermal Baby Receiving Blanket- White,I love these blankets and have several of them.  They hold up well and have a nice texture.  Soft and lightweight but not thin.,5
"South Shore Angel Changing Table, Espresso","If the table did not arrive damaged , we would have given it 4 stars. The wood was chipped visibly at the front which is a shame that it looks like a discounted item given that we paid for a higher end , new one. We are not sure if this happened during packing or shipping. We did not return it because we needed it almost as soon as we got and my husband said it was a task in itself trying to get all the parts packed back properly in the box.The table itself is sturdy and elegant looking. Works great as a changing table.",3
Kiddopotamus Duomat 2 in 1 Car Seat Protector Mat,It could be a little longer at both ends.  The pouches at the bottom don't hang down low enough to be very usable.  The back of the car seat is almost too high for the mat.,4
"The First Years MiSwivel Feeding Seat, Dot to Dot","With our first kid we bought the most expensive high chair at the big box baby store -- it was called a Blossom something or other.  It was a total piece of junk. It started falling apart before our daughter was two. It was hard to clean and it sucked up loads of room. They try and suck you in by saying the high chair transitions to a big kid chair down the road. Newsflash: your kid is gonna want to sit in a REGULAR chair like everybody else when they get big enough to climb into one. You will find splat mats and wipeable placemats are the name of the game before the high chair peddlers can say ""gotcha"".  Besides -- the high chair would not fit snuggly to the side of the table for us as a big kid chair and food was getting everywhere. We have a huge kitchen so space isn't the problem for us with a high chair nor is a budget issue. We just hated that beast of a chair and wanted an alternative. We went with this feeding chair and we're thrilled. To begin, this was less than 1/4 the price of that big flashy high chair. We can buy one of these feeding chairs for our house and one for grandma's and still come out way ahead. Beyond the price are many other benefits. I'm a short person and reaching the high chair from my own chair at dinner was no fun. This chair allows my daughter to sit eye-level at the table with the rest of the family, in her own chair -- not exiled off next to the table in a different contraption. I could immediately see how thrilled my daughter was to take her place at our table the first time we used it at four months. We are big believers in family meals and how that impacts eating habits and provides a sense of cohesiveness and belonging. We credit family meals with our first daughter's early & astounding language skills because she listened to my husband and I talk to each other and to her at mealtime. This chair helps to improve that family meal experience for a little one. The chair is easy to use, it straps tightly under our very wide chairs and around the seat back as well. It isn't going anywhere. The tray fits on nicely. The straps are easy to use. The swivel is great because you can turn the chair sideways (without turning your dining room/kitchen chair) to easily feed baby while you eat at the table. My only complaint would be how hard the seat is and the fact that the back slopes in an odd place making it look uncomfortable. I put a blanket under the seat cover to cushion it a bit but I wish I didn't have to do that. I wish it came with some padding. That's about the only complaint we have. We're thrilled we did not get the big high chair. You really do learn so so much with child #1 and you learn to make smarter, cheaper choices the second time around. :) UPDATE: WE HAVE SINCE PURCHASED A FISHER-PRICE FEEDING CHAIR/SEAT AND LIKE IT BEST. WE SENT THIS ONE TO OUR SCREENED-IN PORCH TO HAVE MEALS OUT THERE WITHOUT MOVING THE EVERYDAY CHAIR. THE FISHER-PRICE CHAIR IS A FLAT SEAT AND BACK AND EVEN WITHOUT A CUSHION MY DAUGHTER IS UNDOUBTEDLY MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE NEW FEEDING SEAT. I STAND FIRM THAT THESE FEEDING CHAIRS/SEATS ARE FAR BETTER THAN THE HIGH CHAIRS.",4
"Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","This product is a life saver! We love it. Also, I would buy it from Amazon rather than a vendor cause it has really great customer service. The first one we bought from Amazon went to the wrong address and they immediately refunded it! So we bought it again. Also, we choose the standard shipping (the cheapest one) and we ended up receiving the stroller much earlier than expected!",5
"American Baby Company 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Natural",This sheet is great. It is soft and comfy. It perfectly fits the new Dream On Me Pack N Play mattress I just bought. Both items fit perfectly into my Graco Pack N Play. We needed a thicker mattress for longer sleeping.,5
"Baby Jogger 2011 City Mini Double Stroller, Black/Black","I did much research before purchasing a double stroller and couldn't be happier.  It is easy to use, has the best sunshades I've ever seen and folds easily.  My children are 3 years and 14 months and are very comfortable riding in this stroller.  My one complaint is the lack of compatibility with the Chicco infant carrier.  With the popularity of this car seat I believe that Baby Jogger is really missing the boat.",5
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),"These bottles are amazing. They can be a pain to clean sometimes, but they keep gas bubbles out of babies tummy and worth it! I like the wide set rather than standard which makes the bottles easier to hold (just my opinion)",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"As always shipping was faster than expected! We got this to free up some floor space in my son's(4 months) room. Who knew kids accumulate stuffed toys to fast! Anyways, this is perfect! It's big and stretchy! Will buy again for my future kids when they come :)",5

"Peg-Perego Aria Twin Stroller, Java","This stroller is comfortable, and it fits everywhere. After researching a lot I decided to go with this one, because was on sale and within my budget.  The front wheels it is hard to turn at the beginning but nothing that some grease and dw40 wouldn't fix. With this stop make noise and start turning easier. I am glad i got this one. My 2 1/2 year and 3 month old baby enjoy it a lot..",4

"My Brest Friend Twins Plus Deluxe Nursing Pillow, Green, 0-12 Months",This was helpful for double nursing when I needed to stand or nurse at night. But it was so bulky I fiund it too inconvenient to mess with most of the time. Great construction though.,3
"Baby Tracker&reg; - Daily Childcare Journal, Schedule Log","I originally just gave the nanny a pad of paper to write down this information for my little one. She would take him to the park and leave the pad behind - I was getting incomplete/inaccurate information when she wohld get home at the end of the day and try to remember naps/feedings/diaper changes. I wanted something she could take with her and also a way to better control how she reported information. This was the perfect solution! Now I'm getting all the information I wanted. There is a very helpful example of how to fill it out. It also has a pouch for additional documents and a section up front for emergency contact info. Each page goes from 7 - 6. This works for me because the nanny starts at 7am and ends before 6pm. I use an app on my phone for tracking when I'm with the baby. I transfer the info from this notebook to my phone. My only complaint: the space is pretty small - they provide useful shorthand, but it's a little difficult to fit some of the info in the space provided. Also, some of the other reviews complain about the 7 - 6 time format. This isn't a real problem for me, but I suppose if you wanted to track an entire day, you would have to use two pages - not too big of a deal. 7am - 6pm is pretty much perfect for daycare/nanny/caregiver situation.",4
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","This newborn rock'n play sleeper has been fantastic.  My daughter has slept in it for nearly every nap and night since she was born and loves it.  It is also super easy to fold up and bring somewhere - we had to stay in a hotel for a weekend and it was so convenient to fold it up, throw it in the car and travel to the hotel - also have brought it to friends and families house during visits (much better than the bulky pack n plays I used to tote around with my first born).  Highly recommend!!",5
Cosco Scenera Convertible Car Seat - Closeout,Bought this car seat for our 2nd vehicle.  Easy to install and easy daily use.  Our toddler seems very comfortable.  Great seat for the price!  Seat reviews well for safety on other sites.,5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"This diaper pail does not stink and is so easy to use!!  Our church uses the diaper genie, and it stinks like crazy!  But this one smells nice all the time.  The refills are so easy to put in.  They come 3 to a box, and they last a long time.  Our son just turned 2 months old yesterday, and we just had to replace the refill for the first time!  That means that if we keep this rate up, we won't have to buy another box of refills until he is 8 months old, since the pail comes with the first set already installed.",5
"MAM 3 Pack Anti-Colic Bottle Boy, 8 Ounce, Colors May Vary","Love this bottle since it's the only bottle my son will drink out of, the nipple shape is great since it matches the pacifier (MAM) he uses. He was a breastfed baby and we needed a bottle to give him on occasion for pumped milk and he would NOT suck on other nipples, but would this b/c it is just like his pacifier.  He still struggled b/c he suffered from &#34;nipple confusion&#34; which I'm still not convinced exists...they just want the real deal, not something silicone or not real to drink from-it's not confusion its just being opinionated :)I give this product 4 stars b/c of the anti-colic ability of the base and the nipple shape, but if I were to rate it on all the parts, I should be giving it a 2-3 stars...it has SO many parts to clean and put back together and it not put back together just right it leaks horribly.  It leaks from the base and the top screw on lid, even if it seems you have screwed it on correctly it might not be.  It's really not so awful, but you have to double check everything to make sure you aren't about to dump milk all over your baby, which we have done in the middle of the night requiring a clothing change for him and for myself.Outside of this great bottle, just wish the rubber nipples were available more readily...apparently they exist, but never could find them.",4
"Bright Starts Walk-A-Bout Walker, Cute Frog","Cute and my 6 month old granddaughter likes it, but when I move it by lifting it, (when she is not in it!) it changes the height  so I have to fix the height again before she goes in it the next time.",3
"Itzy Ritzy Bib, Burp and Bath Cloth, Little Miss Zig Zag","I currently only use this as a burp cloth, but now my baby has started to drool, I'll be able to use it as a bib as well. One less item to carry!  Lightweight fabric but bobbled after one wash. Apart from the bobbling, it's a good product.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,We got this just for my son to chew on instead of anything he could cram in his mouth. He loved the feel of it I guess. It's rubber but  a strange type of rubber unlike anything I had seen before. I even took a chew on it once just to see what the fuss was about. It was slightly harder than I though it would be but clearly soothing to his little sore gums.It washed up easily but never really seemed to get &#34;dirty&#34; although it likely never even seen any dirt. Today it looks as new as we got it although some of the paint has worn off which is fine because its non toxic.,5
"NoJo Night Light, Butterfly","I bought this item as a night lamp as we are expecting a baby soon. The flower is cute and quality is really good. However, the light is too bright. The butterfly doesn't cover the light fully. Further it is an yellow light as well. This is never pointed out in the description. Disappointed with the light but going to retain this as it looks really cute.",2
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"This is a good price for an extra-wide gate.  For what it is, it's fine.  But, as indicated in other reviews, the room sizes it works well for are limited.  My doorway span is 48 inches and we made do, but this gate isn't really made for that width.  Were my door frame slightly larger, the extra expander would've been fine, but it's just not quite wide enough.  Additionally, because we had to almost retro-fit the gate, the sturdiness of the gate is lacking.  (Not sure how this would be affected if my doorway were a size the gate fit well.)  I have a sneaky and motivated dog, and he's been able to push the gate over a couple times when I haven't been watching.  So, be cautious of that as well.  Overall, it's working for me now, but I wouldn't buy it again.",3
NUK Bottle Drying Wand with Ergonomic Handle,"I use this item every single day. I find it very useful, but there are a few minor improvements I would like to see. Thus, I gave this item 4 stars instead of 5.This item has been invaluable to dry bottles either after handwashing, or after removing from the dishwasher when they still have some water/condensation on the inside. We have used it on a variety of bottle types and sizes, and it always works well. The microfiber material absorbs well, and you can dry multiple bottles at a time. The shape and size makes it pretty easy - it is much, much better than using paper towels for this task.The couple VERY MINOR changes I would like to see:  1) At the top - where the red nubs are - it would be better if this was also some sort of absorbent material. 2) The package instructions said to wash before using, but did not give instructions on how to wash. That was a little confusing, and I would still like to know how to wash this item!Overall, this has been a very useful item in our house, with just some very minor misses.",4
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),"I purchased this as a gift to myself and for a friend because we both enjoy scalp massages. We both enjoy the product, however, we were a little disappointed that all three were plain silver color, rather than different colors. It provides a nice, gentle scalp massage. The tips of the prongs are rounded, so there's no pinching or scraping against your skin. The only downside is that it is somewhat flimsy, so you can't get quite as intense a massage. In any case, we both like it as a way to relax and enjoy a light massage.",4
Tranportation Blue Nap Mat,"Using for my 2 yo at daycare for nap time. Have used for 3 weeks, has held up fabulously through the washer and dryer. Very fluffy and soft. Would definitely recommend.",5
"Foscam FBM3501 Digital Video Baby Monitor - 2.4 Ghz with Pan/Tilt, Nightvision and Two-Way Audio/Video Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD (White/Gray)","We are searching for a replacement for our older Summer Infant video monitor which has become a bit crackly and dependent on it's power cord, even though we can still hear our son's breaths. However, I have yet to find a new monitor that offers the same audio quality, which is shocking considering these are baby monitors--wouldn't audio be the primary feature?This monitor must be turned up so loud to hear our son that we hear the constant his of poor quality speakers the entire time the monitor is in use.As well, the night time video quality is very poor. I expect a bit of graininess and vagueness from a night vision monitor, but I couldn't even distinguish my son's bright blond head from his dark sheets and stuffed animals.",1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",it is my first carrier and i'm very happy with my purchase. It is super comfortable. Yesterday i wore this for almost 4 hours when i took my son out....he slept pretty much through out and wasn't cranky. He is 3 months old.,5

"Excellante' Wooden High Chair, Walnut (Packaging May Vary)","overall it is just OK for its price, the joints are not clean cut,  it has some really rough edges, we had to grind down and sand paper it so it leaves a smooth edges.  you can feel sprinter when you pass your fingers through it which is not baby friendly at all.  And also we got a different color than what was picture, we didnt want to hassle with the return so we kept.",2

"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips Soft Starter Spill Proof Cup 2 Handle, 6 Ounce, Horizontal, Colors May Vary","My son is only 5.5 months but is practicing with these cups. They don't leak and have a semi-soft spout (not a silicone spout).  Baby seems to know how to use and chews the spout often (teething). Just wish the cup had markings indicating the number of ounces.Oh, and yay because I got boy colors! First time that has happened!",5

I rent my house, so putting carpet in was something that I couldn't do. My whole house is tile, so this was a good solution. My 9month old sits, stands and falls down on these all day long and doesn't get hurt. The price of these online is expensive. I bought these for $20 a pk at a K-Mart.

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, White, Mesh","I would never buy a Baby Bjorn again. The carrier is overpriced for what it is. It is, in all effects, a newborn/infant carrier. It's a LOT of money to lay down for a carrier that you can use for less than a year, and in many cases it is much less than a year.The carrier also poses some comfort/positioning concerns. For the person wearing the carrier, it just isn't very supportive. It's better than older models, but still not comfortable by any means once your baby weighs more than 10 lbs.The carrier also hangs baby by his/her crotch, which is not good for their hips and spine. There are much better options out there, and most of them cost significantly less than this carrier.",1
Summer Infant Body Support Pillow,"Genius!I bought it when I was 2 and 1/2 months pregnant and it changed my sleep overnight!My back and hips felt so much more comfortable, it was a relief right away and I really did sleep better.Now with my belly growing, it's nice to snug the pillow side under my belly and prevent my waist and ligaments from pulling.I drag it along to the living room daily for my nap, use it every night and am wondering how to pack it on my babymoon as I wouldnt dream of not taking it with me :-)Plus, it can be used for the breastfeeding and as a cuddling cot for your baby later on...",4
"Pepperpot Baby Record Book, Molly's Nursery","Once I laid eyes on this baby book there was no turning back. I knew I wanted it the minute I saw it. I am so happy with this purchase. It is everything I hoped for and more. The first day it arrived, I started filling stuff in. It is so beautiful...all the pages are a little different with the design and it is so pretty. The pages are thick to prevent ink bleeding through which is great. I cant wait for my daughters arrival so I can fill out more! The overall quality of this book is amazing. I am in total awe over it and I would recommend it to everyone! I also love how detailed it is and everything it has you fill out. No details will be left out and I will be able to record EVERYTHING. It goes all the way to five years old. Lots of record keeping! Oh and did I mention how beautiful it is?! (I got Camille).",5
"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster, Carbon","We bought this booster for my daughter since she was growing out of the carseat in my husband's car. I really liked all of the safety features. My daughter says it is comfortable and she is able to fall asleep and stay asleep comfortably thanks to the side impact features. We liked it so much that when she grew out of the carseat in my car, we purchased another one. The only complaint I have is that it can be a little tricky to buckle up. I have to reach all the way across my daughter and she can't quite get it herself yet. However, her safety is my number one priority.",4

I recommend this product and if I had to would buy it again.,5
Child to Cherish Marshmallow Clay Handprint Ornament,"This is a great way to create a keepsake of your child.  I plan on making one for all my children (maybe even some for the grandparents!).It was easy to use and the instructions were great.The marshmellow clay as a little strange and is very light and fluffy when it dries.  I expected it to be more firm.  It seems like it would be really easy to just break in half.  However, there is a benefit to this, as the handprints made when I was a kid weighed about 20lbs and shattered if they fell.  This will be easy to store, slightly protected, and won't make my tree fall over!I would definitely reccommend this product.  It would just require some protected storage (as do many Christmas ornaments).",5
Mommy's Helper Toilet Seat Lid-Lok,"This product did not work with our toilet because of the angle of the toilet bowl.  There was no way of knowing this until we took it out of the box and tried to install it.  We ended up with a swing-shut toilet lock from Target instead, which would probably work for a wider variety of toilet shapes.  (Who ever knew there was a variety of different bowl shapes in the first place?)",1
"Mud Pie Baby EiEiO Teether Blankie, Horse","I ordered this as a gift and was very disappointed.  The description says it is 8"" x 9"", which it probably is if you measure from the tip the ears and the bottoms of the feet.  The blanket itself is 5"" x 5"".  It is not a ""blankie"" as stated in the description, but a small scrap of cloth with teething items attached.",1

Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"I purchased these and received them today! I have been on a search for baby food containers for my homemade food. These are just what I was looking for, and I wish I would have purchased them sooner. The lid fits very snug. I previously used a regular ice cube tray then wrapped it in plastic wrap to find my food freezer burnt. So far my only complaint is the size. I assumed like most freezer trays these were 2 oz cubes. However, they are only 1 oz. My little munchkin loves to eat and we could easily go through half a tray in one sitting. They should make 2 oz trays, and they would be absolutely perfect!",4

Combi Urban Baby Carrier Yellow,This carrier works great. I have a 20# 6 month old & he does wonders in it. The only downfall is the strap kind of rubs my neck & makes it a bit uncomfortable. I have tried the native slings & they SUCK!!! Hope this helps.,3

Evenflo Aura Select Travel System - Caroline,"I received this travel set yesterday. We ordered it in Pink Cuddle Bear. I was soooo amazed. Wow! Assembly was sheer simplicity! My husband was at work and I assembled the entire set by myself in less than 20 minutes... and I have carpal tunnel in my left wrist. Again, simple. The picture just did not give this set justice, it is much much nicer when you actually see it. The pink is so soft and pretty and the materials used to make these items are very nice, not cheap at all. I feel as though I have purchased a Mercedes for the price of a Kia. The stroller is very sturdy and comes with plenty of bells and whistles and the car seat is definately deluxe. The car seat fits easily on top of the stroller to create a travel system that will be PERFECT for your little angel. I love it and I can't wait until my baby girl arrives so that she can enjoy it too. You will definately get your moneys worth plus much more with this one. This set is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!! 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!!!!!",5
Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Jumperoo,"My baby loves this Jumperoo.  It's bulky so if you are tight on space that may be an issue, but other than that no complaints.",5
Safety 1st Soothing Mist Ultrasonic Humidifier,"I bought this product to add some moisture to my child's room because of frequent nose bleeds and a pellet stove that sucks all the moisture out of the air. (sorry being honest here)  and I LOVE IT!!  Great for a small room but for the price you could get two for a larger room.  I love the swivel spout and the option to change it to blow in two directions. Can't go wrong on this product.  My only problem though is the product description states it has an auto shut off and it hasn't shut off since I bought it and I've had it running all night.  Maybe it's because I leave my son's door, not a big deal for me though.  My child states he sleeps better and doesn't wake up dry anymore.",5
"Baby Jogger City Elite Single Stroller, Red",When I first ordered this model they sent one that 2012 on the box and my daughter in law went right to reviews and read that this newer model has better safety features. I exchanged that model for this one; the latest one just out. My daughter in law and my son are both happy so I am too.,5

"Graco DuoDiner LX Highchair, Oasis","Worth every penny.  The best highchair I have ever used. The designers thought of everything. I would suggest that if you are looking for highchair look no further because this is truly a great buy and it might cost a few dollars but it's the 5th and last highchair I will ever buy. If it cost $400.00 it would still be a deal. We use it as a seat, craft center, kitchen island, and even a place for your child to learn how to refine there fine motor skills while eating.",5

Medela Supplemental Nursing System,"I suffer from IGT (insignificant glandular tissue) and only produced about 3oz of milk a day (yes, I've tried every prescription/herb/remedy out there). My daughter was only about seven weeks old when she started refusing to nurse except for at night. It was devastating to me. I want to breastfeed my daughter more than anything! My natural birth turned into a c-section...and now I couldn't even breastfeed. I became an exclusive pumping mama and was connected to the pump for hours a day! It made me really really depressed. I was doing some research about IGT and discovered the SNS. It was seriously like Christmas for me, I ordered it the second I found it! My daughter was four months old when it arrived and had not been breast fed for almost a month. It definitely took A LOT of patience and dedication, but she has not had a bottle since the day it arrived! It has been the most incredible gift to be able to be able to breastfeed my daughter, even though I don't make enough milk. I would recommend the SNS to anyone who really wants to have that closing BFing relationship with their child. Breastfeeding is about SOO much more than just the milk. Thank you Medela for making it possible for women like me to nurse our sweet babies!",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"I bought one a couple of years ago for my then two-year-old, then passed it on to a friend.  But then decided to go to Disney World for the kid's 5th birthday this spring.  Stroller rental was outrageous, and my friend had donated my old one to Goodwill.  So I bought this.  My daughter was about 43 inches and 42 pounds.  She was possibly too tall for it and seemed a little hunched up, but she said it was comfortable--and the fact that she repeatedly fell asleep in it attests to that fact.Anyway, great stroller, easy to push, tall handles so you don't hunch over.  Storage is a bit of a pain with the X frame behind the basket, but you get used to it pretty quickly.Definitely recommend--lightweight and sturdy",5
Go Diego Go Rescue Jump Fleece Throw,"We bought this for our grandson who is a new big brother, and it's his very favorite blanket now!  It's just the right size, and it's Diego, so it's a hit.  Thanks for having his available for us.",5

E-Ware Dual-Layer Multi-Purpose Large Food Steamer (EW-5K118),"I was looking for a solution to help make baby food. Some of the criteria was: I did not want to spend too much, wanted a multi-purpose gadget (given I can cook adult portions in it too), and BPA Free - and this  steamer  was it. When it arrived I wasn't that thrilled about the size, it takes some good counter space, it's bigger than I would like, but I like the idea of a multiple layers! The timer is useful, set it and forget it. The plastic is easy to clean. But because it's on a bulky side, it's not so easy to move the base around and clean it after each use. As I am writing this, I read some of the reviews about rust for the first time, mine doesn't have any yet. I wonder if removing the water from the base reservoir after each use would help prevent rust but again it's a bit bulky to move around.",4

Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,"Easy to clean, easy to set up, cute design. Like that I can take the tray off with one or both hands. Top tray piece comes off for easy cleaning.

Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"My daughter hates the Avent nipple, she is breastfed and can't seem to suck on these nipples, even though she does fine with regular nipples.  I find that ironic since they market these as easy to transition from breast to bottle.  The wide neck makes it harder for me to keep air out of the nipple.  These bottles are large and they don't fit any other nipples or rings.  They don't fit well in my dishwasher baskets either.  They are just plain cumbersome, and overpriced.",2
Stella Mamma organic silicone necklace-phenix black(no sales tax),"It is not shiny like others I have seen, but still an interesting & fun design! My son picked it up off my chest & began chewing on it before I had a chance to show it to him! He loves it & I really like wearing it too!",5
Good Night Bear - 5 Piece Bedding Set,"My husband and I are expecting our first baby in July.  We don't know the sex, so trying to find a suitable bedding set was very difficult.  We looked at other sets that were double the price and really didn't offer much more.  After going to BRU to see it in person we bought it on the spot. It is absolutely beautiful! At our BRU they had the lamps and mobiles.  Decorating the nursery has been fun and easy so far. We are very pleased with this product and look forward to adding the other pieces soon.",5
BornFree 9 oz. Wide Neck Glass Bottle,"I switched over to Born Free when bubs was 4.5 months because I started to become really concerned about other chemicals leaking into the milk due to BPA free plastic baby bottles.  Researched for quite a while and glass bottles are quite expensive.  I switched from the Avent system and was quite concerned that baby wouldn't like them.  It took him a few days to adjust to the speed of the new nipples but he is fine now (stage 2, he is almost five months). I was also concerned about the venting system working like Avent so that he wouldn't get gas in his stomach.  Let me assure you that the system is different but also limits the gas, you can see the bubbles rising to the surface just like Avent.  When I got the bottles I was pleasantly surprised that they placed a cap like insert with the bottle so that you can close up the bottle without the nipple.  With Avent you must buy these separately.  Also, these bottles really are leak free as long as you screw them tight enough.  No more annoying milk leaks after shaking up the bottle. The mouth is also very wide so easy to make formula in.  The bottles that I got were not from Amazon (found cheaper. $7.50 for a 9oz) but another provider so the ml markings were engraved in the bottle.  This is nice because they will never rub off, but also a bit hard to see in the dark.  The bottle has five parts all together which is a bit annoying to clean and put together but because I wanted a good quality glass bottle that is what you have to live with.  As other reviewers have mentioned you can tell this is good quality glass, very thick.  It is not Pyrex though so be careful heating or going from extreme temperatures. I hope to save these bottles if I have another baby.  Also, a good tip for parents-to-be.  It is not necessary to get the smaller size 4 or 5oz bottles just because your baby is a newborn.  Just buy the 9oz bottles and don't fill it up as much.  When your baby hits about 3-4 months they will eat a lot more and it is not worth filling up two small bottles when all you need is one big bottle.  I have six size 9oz bottles and that gets me through one day and a night.  I look forward to using the sippy spouts and transforming the bottles to good chemical free sippys.  I am a bit disappointed in Avent for not making glass bottles.  I chose the system because I needed to pump milk so bought into the whole bottle system because of that. You can tell which companies are actually concerned about the quality of their products and the well being of their consumers by giving choices. I don't see how it would be difficult for Avent to offer glass bottles.  I think the issue is profits, plastic bottles are more cheaper to make than glass.Also, plastic BPA free bottles become scratched up and it is hard to make sure the the inside is clean because of the plastic.  With the glass, you can feel that squeaky clean feeling and can see that the bottle is clean.  One other point, you can pour very hot water in these and let them cool to put formula in later, without worrying about chemicals leaching into the water.  Only con: the bottle is heavier but not an issue for me.",5

Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"After reading some of the reviews I thought I was going to need to brush up on my calculus to install the rail.Its actually pretty easy. The only &#34;trick&#34; is how the straps are configured. Originally I accidently put the straps on the same side instead of across, from rail to rail. It was very easy to detach the straps and reposition. It took, maybe, 20 minutes to properly install it.After installing under the mattress, I put my full, grown man body weight against the rail and it held surprisingly well. It didn't really budge at all. I'm very confident that my kid that weighs about 10% of my body weight will stay put in bed at night with these in place.",5

Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,"The good:  My kids love their new 'light guys' and we no longer have to leave their room lights on all night.  Its easy to take along for travel, and I plan to use them on car trips as well, since my daughter does not like being in the car in the dark.The bad: I ordered 2 lights originally.  One of them was defective - the black case on the AC adapter was broken so that it could open easily, exposing the wires inside.  I got a replacement and that one had the same problem!  The next replacement was fine, however.The base charger is nice, but its hard to tell if the light is actually charging or not since slightly shifting the nightlight while it is on the base can change the indicator light from red (not charged) to green (charged).You can only use the 15 minute timer with the blue light.  It would be nice to be able to turn on the timer independently of the light color.Leaving it on blue, the battery easily lasts 12 hours or more.  However, the red or changing color modes seem to only last a few hours at the most.  So we end up using blue all the time rather than enjoying the other colors.",3

"South Shore Savannah Collection Door Chest, Pure White","Just recently received & assembled this 'door chest'.Jan 2010. FYI there is a huge problem in the shipping of it. It is so heavy that the box falls apart during the shipping & that should be addressed!!! It was sent back before I even got it the first time. I was not notified - I HAD TO CALL TO SEE WHERE IT WAS! But, I reordered & it arrived - AGAIN the box torn, but all pieces were there - so be aware!! It does take TIME & Patience to assemble. TWO 'CALM' heads would be helpful when doing the assembly ! :) But it does fit together nicely - drawers glide nicely, door adjusts easily.I looked around for awhile and this is a nice size, looks very nice, & really does the job for the cost.",5
BRICA Roll 'n Go Car Seat Transporter,Practiced ahead of time before we had to actually coordinate it right before we got on the plane and everything worked great. It was a graco carseat and we were not comfortable letting him ride in it...but it did save our backs and free up some hands.,5

KidCo Convertible Crib Bed Rail Finish: Natural,Purchased for a crib that is no longer manufactured and the convertible components were not available.

"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","We tried another sling for our first baby, and when we discovered the Mobi we found out how inferior all other slings are.The Mobi isn't a sling; it's a wrap. The way the wrap works (which is described in the instructions that come with the Mobi means that the baby is held securely, close to mom in a way that makes it impossible for them to fall out, while supporting them in a way that is safe. Our Mobi wrap was recommended by our pediatrician, and she was right!We've shared this with other new parents, and every one of them has loved it as well. After using ours, I know at least three other families who later bought a Mobi.You won't be disappointed!",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","I bought this for my daughter hoping she'd be interested in carrying her own toys and knick knacks so I don't have to pack a full diaper bag now that she's older, but maybe b/c she's still under 2, she's not all that interested in carrying this thing even if it's empty, just for fun. Hopefully she'll grow into it and she'll use it for several years. I don't know how durable it is, but it's pretty cute and seems sturdy and well made. I don't like how the Owl's eyes are made of felt, they will definitely get dirty over time and that part is not so durable and will be hard to clean compared to the rest of the backpack which probably can be just cleaned with some water and a cloth externally. I'm not sure if the whole thing can/should be thrown into the washer?",3
Baby Trend Single Snap N' Go Stroller,"I have the Chicco keyfit 30, which is a great car seat, but rather heavy.  This makes my snap n go indispensable.  It isn't the equivalent of a high end stroller of course, but its pretty sturdy, and quite light.  One of the reviewers complained that the keyfit isn't compatible, that the seat gets scratched by the stroller.  If used properly (there are little red tabs which have to adjusted to a larger car seat like the keyfit 30), it may still cause the most superficial of scratches, but certainly doesn't endanger the integrity of the seat.  I agree with the complaints that you have to go around to the front of the stroller to get things in and out of the lower basket, but this is a minor complaint.  It handles pretty well.  It takes some assembly, but nothing too complicated.",5

Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,This gate doesn't clamp into the sides of our opening that well.  A visiting dog rushed into it and bent the metal.

"Graco Highback TurboBooster Car Seat, Spitfire","Paid $50 for this same item in a different print at Target, so I was excited when I found this one for $42.49 online.

Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I love this pail. It takes regular trash bags and contains the odors. It's not exactly odor proof, but you won't smell anything unless you leave it for more than two weeks. I keep a spray can of room freshener next to the pail and when I get a stinking diaper, I give the pail lid (the inside blue part) a quick spray and everything is fine. I'm happy with the purchase and since it was only 15 bucks, you can't beat the pricing. - Months later and still love it!!!",4

"Thermos FUNtainer Food Jar, Disney Princess, 10 Ounce",Product is good but it is not the right price compared to the walmarts or the other big box stores where you could feel the product and buy. Though I wish I could give better rating but for the pricing disadvantages I would give only 2 stars.,1
Evenflo Journey Elite Travel System - 3 Little Bears,"Actually bought a different color, but same model. Not as nice as I hoped. Not exactly ""one handed use"" as the product boasts. Product has inconsistent performace. Sometimes it has trouble unfolding, sometimes it has trouble latching the carseat into it. About the only consistencies are that it usually os fold up easily, and the car seat latches into the base for the car easily. The carseat base for the vehicle is not adjustable. My newborn head was flopping all around. I had to be risky and prop the base a bit with a cushion. (NOT GOOD). The ""one handed steering"" doesn't manuever as well as I hoped. I either have to strong- arm it or stop what I'm doing and use two hands. Overall, I wish I was more educated so I could choose a model that would be better for me, or spent more money on a better modl with better quality.",2
"Rumparooz Reusable Cloth Pocket Diaper, Ladder 6, Aplix",I am pretty new to the whole cloth diaper thing so I don't really have anything to compare these to but I love love love them.  They are really absorbant and my son seems to like them.  The only thing I think could be an issue for alot of mom's is that I don't think it is likely to actually last until potty training for most kids.  My son is a very tiny 22 month old.  He weighs 21 pounds and wears 18 month cloths (though the waist is almost always to big) this diaper fits him great! He has two snaps left for the closure tabs and is on the last set of the rise snaps.  I think most 18 to 24 month olds will probably barely fit into these.  That being said they are absolutely wonderful!!  I think even if you can only use them the first year to year and a half they are well worth it.,4

"Baby K'tan Breeze Baby Carrier, White, Large","I've had this Ktan since my daughter was a new born. She is now almost nine months old and I use it at least 4-5 times a week. It is so easy to use and comfy for her and I. She had awful reflux as an infant so keeping her upright was a big deal to help. Not to mention she was ON me so she was much happier. Se still loves it. I will use it for at leat six more months or until she is too big for it.  Mommys, you can even discretely nurse in it! It is the number one baby product I would recommend to every mommy! It washes well, and can easily be stuffed in a diaper bag or purse, unlike the other bulky carriers. Get it, love it!",5
Gerber 4 Pack Flannel Burpcloth Set (Neutral),"I must have 20-30 of these Gerber flannel burp cloths because my baby is a HUGE spitter. These cloths work great for the amount of spit up a normal baby has, but not for one who spits up copious quantities. For my baby they only make it through one spitting episode before they have to be washed. They also don't wick the moisture up, so the spit tends to run down the cloth instead of being absorbed. We still use them as lap clothes for the baby though. If you have a heavy spitter you can make cute burp clothes by using a cloth diaper and adding pretty ribbon to it. They are super absorbent and mean less washing of your own clothes.I have seen other Moms use these whose babies don't spit up ounces at a time and they worked great for them which is why I am giving these 4 stars.Pros: InexpensiveGood sizeCons: Not super absorbent",4
"KF Baby Animal Soft Sole Booties, for 3-12 Months - Cow","They are super warm!! But, my they were HUGE on my baby's feet!  I wish they had a 3-6 size!  Other than that, they have anti-skid stuff on the bottoms, and are super soft on the inside!",3
"FuzziBunz 3 Pack Microfiber Inserts, Medium/Large","I love these inserts for my sons diapers.  I use fuzzi buns diapers and I find these to be absorbent, sturdy and some of the best I have tried.  I also use a hemp soaker and love it just as much, but this one is pretty great too.  I agree with the other review about it catching lint, but taking a few extra steps, that issue can be eliminated.  I have a front facing lint catcher and if I don't make sure my catch and the area in front of the door are clean my inserts come out with beards.  A little bit of cleaning and prep has minimized my lint problem.Overall these inserts hold up pretty well, they are one of the few don't go bald after a dozen washes and don't get skinny.  I have used them for about a 10 months and a few are wearing but that is expected with constant use.",4
"NUK Learner Cup BPA Free Silicone Spout, Single Pack, Colors May Vary","I was initially really excited about these sippy cups because my babies (twins) took to them really quickly.  Probably becaue the spout felt very similar to the nipple on their bottles.  It made the transition away from bottles easier.  Unfortunately they didn't last very long.  We used them for about 2 weeks and because the spout was so soft, the kids started to nibble on the tips and after a few days I noticed tiny holes in the spout getting larger and larger with every use.  Now the milk just pours right out and the spill proof spout is no longer spill proof.  I don't want to bother buying replacement spouts because they are almost the same cost as the entire learner cup.  I feel like I wasted my money on this product because I didn't get much use out of it -- 2 weeks was definitely not worth the money.",2
Traffic Light Lamp,"The lamp (or more of a night light) is adorable maybe a little small, the only thing I don't like is it blinks and you can't turn off the blinking.",3
Bright Starts Flutter and Link Friend,A good product overall..it is a bit low for hanging in the car seat and you have to be careful with it.. However i often take it out and let my daughter play with it as she loves to chew on the wings..the wings are made of cloth with some ruffling material inside that is noisy and keeps my daughter interested..the downside is that it is light pink in color which does get dirty and i dont think we can machine wash it bcz not all the plastic taggies can be taken out.,5

"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","Love that its red & super visible in parking lots, etc.Love that its easy to fold & light!Love the shade.... & how both car seat & stroller make a little egg to protect the baby.Don't like how it connects to car seat. It is a design flaw that should be fixed in next model. Car seat wobbles. Because the car seat is heavy, its hard to maneuver onto the stroller pegs that it has on either side.  I'm a smaller woman, so its a problem for me, it may not be for others.... but the pegs you have to aim at suck.  I'm still over all happy.  Stroller on its own rocks!",4
Munchkin Caterpillar Spillers Stacking Cups,My little girl loves these.  She loves bath time only if there are toys! :) She just loves to play with the water and these cute little cups.  And they stack together so they hardly take up space.,4
Chewbeads Necklace - Jane - Black,rubber balls pinch the hairs on the back of my neck and daughter wasn't so interested anyway.  Wanted to love it...  Too expensive.,2
Flingshot Flying Monkey,Bought this for my Dad when he was stressed out at work. He had a blast with it and still uses it to help release stress when they are having a hectic day at the office.,5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"This is an excellent product.  It is well built, it being used for the second time and has not lost a single toy yet.  My son loved the saucer and he still likes to get in it even though he is 2 1/2.  My daugther who is 6 months will easily stay inside the dish for at least 45 minutes.  Plenty of toys and the chair is easily swivled.  Great buy!",5
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"I purchased the Diaper Genie Easy Twist Away, well it was part of a shower gift. We've returned one, as the catch for the cover(with the twist) broke. This is a piece less than a centimeter long and maybe one millimeter wide. It's what helps lock the cover down.The second one, seemed to work great........then......after changing one of the plastic inserts, which we'd brought at Baby's R Us, where it was ordered for us, the Genie would not twist and make it's renknowned sausages, with each hermetically sealed diaper. It instead would just drop the diapers down into a giant sac below, no secure twist to separate the diapers.Now the instructions say to push the diaper down till the lower hinges grab the diaper, about 4-5 inches. The instructions also say to turn it an extra 4 times to sort of prime the unit for the first one or two diapers. BUT none of this has worked, the twisting that separates diapers  just won't work. We're trying the magic number four and it's not reliable, sometimes six or seven , which consumes mucho expensive  insert plastic....if the manufacturer ""knows"" it will take up to 8 turns.....then say so and reduce the price or increase the amount of insert plastic.Oh......I'm with everyone else. The cutter is hit or miss. Trust us, we turn it while holding the button down as prescribed and tried every combination of turning more , turning less, turning after button pops up, but instead, again, i'm left using three hands, me, husband and scissors to free the bag, just to have the giant sac problem repeat itself......we want this to work, it just doesn't.Here's our guess and believe me we're getting on the horn with Playtex. The Old unit which took a funnel, has gazillions of insert packages left on the market. The new unit has packages labeled Easy Twistaway. Funny thing is the new Diaper Genie Pail unit (twist away) seems to work best with the old funnel Diaper Genie Pail inserts. You can look at the inserts and clearly see a difference in the design of the 5-8 dollar packages. One has little notches spaced every 1.5 inches. along the outer circumference of the insert package. The other (the Easy Twist) insert, has the raised notches on the inner edge of the package. The unit seems designed to turn the older types not the new types. What's up?The directions clearly indicate on the insert being UNIVERSAL, providing directions for the older funnel type and the newer EASy TWist One hander......well there's nothing one handed about a unit that won't work it's own disposable proprietary insert. This is almost clearly a product recall issue for those of us who are having this dillema of the big sac of diapers versus the designed sausages. I hope Playtex soon acknowledges this problem. It's not so ""simple"" as twist four times. Plain observation shows that units are being sold that are not universal with their own inserts. I think it's a way of selling off inserts until they extinguish the old units.........anyhow the new Easy Twist does not work unless you have the right inserts.......or maybe they're manufacturing the insides of the Easy Twist, with the Funnel type tops......Anyhow beware, we're gentle handed people and this unit is supposed to be a no brainer, not a feet in packaging engineering , santitation and empiric science......it's supposed to work most of the time, and any problems, should be informed to the consumer by the manufacturer.........Maybe enough of us can get this fixed. I like the product genuinely, smells good, sanitary-ish......etc........but I'd like it best not in ""theory"" but in practice..",2
PiddlePad Waterproof Seat Liner,"It takes 3 seconds to make sure the piddle pad is going to be under your child before putting them in, oppose to an hour to wash the whole car seat.  Remember on vacations it is sometimes not easy to wash your childs car seat.  Do you really want them sitting in a messy seat?  It is perfect for car rides, airplane rides ( when its not that easy to change a diaper ), and in the stroller.  I am pregnant with the second and already have them in the mail and on their way to me.  I recommend them to everyone!!!",5
"Argington Sahara Convertible Crib, White","I can only echo what others have written here.  I had a horrible experience with Argington.  Everything was backordered, which was not disclosed when I made my purchase.  I had to beg them to ship every item---I barely had the crib in time for my baby, despite having placed the order more than three months early.  Some items I didn't have even nine months later, when after months and months of them promising to ship the items to me (always with me inquiring---where's my stuff?  no one from their end ever bothered to contact me with an update), I finally only got a refund when I threatened to take them to small claims court.  How, with a good conscience, do you sell items that you can't deliver to customers?  Also, the quality was shoddy.  To give them credit, they did replace one particularly poorly made item, but still---I expected better.  From a customer service perspective, though, steer clear at all costs.  You may never get what you've paid for.  As another user said, I wanted to like this company very much.  Yet I think that in my entire adult life, I've never been as poorly treated as I was by them.Of particular note, one of the main reasons why I purchased the product (besides the general ""green"" design) was the convertibility to a toddler crib.  After nine months, however, I have given up hope on getting them to ship me the conversion kit.  Which makes it all a huge sham, and defeats the whole point of my purchase.",1
Snuza Hero Baby Movement Monitor,I feel so much better using this. The other movement monitors only work in a crib- this works anywhere. The only thing I don't like is that it is hard to turn off-you have to push 2 buttons simultaneously- I guess so it doesn't turn off accidentally. I am glad I got this it should  be on everyone's registry.,5
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","This product really does work, and it doesn't look ridiculous like some of the other locks available.  It has held up to a year of abuse from our toddler and is still going strong.  I just purchased a second door monkey to lock another door in the house.",5
Mobi Tykelight GloMate Plus,"I gave the previous edition a 5 star too.  However, it wound up with problems a few months later.  Specifically, the colors stopped working.This one looks like it fits the base better, and it seems more durable.  The light around the base is a nice improvement too.",5
Plug 'N Outlet Cover,"Would work great for things like lamps, clocks, etc that have thin cables.  But power bar cables are too thick to fit in these.  Bummer.",1
"NUK Replacement Silicone Spout, Clear",I originally purchased the Nuk active cup to help wean my daughter off of the Nuk bottle when she was one. She took to the cup right away and never needed a bottle again. These replacement spouts are great because a year later ours need to be replaced. But you could also just purchase these replacement spouts and use the on the Nuk bottles and save $10 a cup.,5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I has been over 9 months since we have purchased this swing and I have honestly say that it has helped a LOT. For a few months it was the only place where our baby would nap and not wake up screaming... Even now, when she is almost up to the weight limit we still use it when she is tired and needs a minute to rest however we do not use motor anymore just because she is to heavy . No issues with the motor before, it does make a ""clicking"" noise but is has never bothered us, we put the music on on the lowest lever and it was all good. Strongly recommend for the parents whose babies have sleeping issues.",5
Sassy Pop n' Push Car,"very cute toy. It can run very far only by pulling back it on the ground as far as you want. The little balls inside of it are very cute. My son got it when he was 7 month old, and played with it for more than a month everyday. He just loves it.",5
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda Compagno Stroller, Nero","I was soo excited to get this stroller. I thought the price was great. I started putting it together, the front wheels went on with no problem, but the back wheels will NOT snap in like they are supposed to. I thought maybe Im just doing it wrong, so I had 3 other people help me and no one could get the wheels to snap on. So I called the manufacturer to see if maybe the axel was wrong, they sent a new one but of course that did not fix the problem, So needless to say, I will NEVER order another stroller on here again.",2
Boon Odd Duck - Squish,I wanted our daughter to have as many safe toys as possible. A PVC free toy is safer the a regular plastic one at the same price so I was sold. The baby enjoys playing at it and clutching it w/ both hands. Eventually we will use it in the bath. For now it's a safe toy w/o bells and whistles w/ no small parts that is safe for an infant. I love the bright color and am ordering Bob next!,5

Hooter Hiders Nursing Cover - Aero,"I really like this nursing cover. It's cute, adjustable, has the peep device in the front. However, It makes me so hot. I don't know why. It seems like a think piece of fabric but every time I use it I get extremely hot...",4
"Baby Brezza Temperature Control Kettle, White/Grey",I bought one these for my wife to make it easier for the both of us with the middle of the night feeding. It was doing its job and then one night it turned off and never came back on. So I went out and bought another one (same product) and what do you know the same exact thing happened. I don't know if it is my bad luck i got two faulty kettles or what but this is really frustrating and wasting a lot of money on faulty products.,1
Professional Clinical Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead (Fahrenheit Readings),"Just bought this as we have a new baby on the way. Tested it out on myself tonight. Within 2 minutes the readings at the same place (right temple with hair out of the way as described in instructions at the same distance from forehead) were: 98.2, 98.6, 99.9, 101.7.  Really? Am I supposed to take the average?  I can't get it to say the same thing twice.An oral thermometer read 98.6.Very frustrated with this productI am a physician, but was buying this for home use.",2

"Britax Marathon 70 Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","I reviewed this product and other similar products for quite some time before deciding.  This car seat is easy to install.  I love the clips underneath the padding, which alleviates a lot of stress from using the old metal clip on certain types of seat belts.  This car seat had very high rating and I am completely satisfied with it.Great purchase",5

Baby Bamboo Feeding Spoons (Set of 2),"These were nice spoons and I appreciate that they are natural and chemical-free.  However, they do seem to wear down quickly over time with repeated washing, and I'd recommend discarding them once your baby starts chewing-- my 10 month old was able to bite off a small piece.",2
"Baby Aspen Big Dreamzzz Baby Ballerina Layette Set with Gift Box, Pink",This was ordered as a shower gift.  I will be giving this gift in two weeks.  Hopefully they will be happy with the fit.,5
"Britax Advocate 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","This car seat is absolutely perfect for my 10 month old daughter!! We had to upgrade from the Chicco KeyFit 30 due to a car accident.  In order to leave the hospital, my husband and I had to go get a new car seat.  We went to the nearest babies 'r' us while my daughter was still admitted, and purchased a Safety First similar model, and loved the look of it.  However, when my daughter would fall asleep in it, her head would fall forward EVERY time, looking so uncomfortable, and that couldn't have been good for her developing neck!! So, I returned it and did my research on amazon and decided to spend the money on this seat.  I am so happy with the purchase! The print is beautiful, even more vibrant in person and is a soft, velour type material.  It is relatively easy to install, depending on whether you use the anchors and their position in your car.  Its not too heavy, and my daughter is so snuggled and comfortable in it, she falls asleep almost immediately making for a much happier car ride for my family!! I would definitely recommend this, and will purchase it for my future children.",5
"Evenflo Triumph 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Easton","I was t-boned at 35mph by some woman driving her minivan while texting.  Our mazda is totaled, my wife and I are bruised up, but my son is safe and sound.  He actually laughed after the crash and I promptly ordered the same seat to replace the old one.it's BIG, but it does its job.  Very easy to install and adjust, I love how you don't have to re-rout the straps to grow with your little one.",5
"Dr. Brown's 3 Pack BPA Free Polypropylene Bottle, 8 oz","Our twins spent 3 weeks in the NICU after they were born for several reasons.  After many of the severe issues cleared up for them, they still were not able to come home until they were able take full feeds by themselves (by bottle) every time.  The nurses used our dr. brown bottles we had bought.  I was told by several of the NICU nurses that Dr. Brown's were the best....so I was very glad that I had chosen those bottles for our babies.Fast forward two months and having the babies home now....these bottles LEAK!!  My husband and I have been soaked several times--and the problem is they are inconsistenly leaking--we COULD NOT figure out why they were leaking.  I had just opened another new package of these bigger bottles as we are starting to outgrow the 4 ounce ones, and I looked at the informational packet inside.  The print is SOOO small--like a size 4 font, seriously!  Anyway, I read through it trying to determine if there was something I was doing wrong, and sure enough, the last part says that the blue insert needs to have the hole vent up and not covered in formula.  SO, we put it to the test.  and YES, no more leaks.  So we line up the brown insert holes with the ""DR. BROWN"" words on the bottle and make sure the blue tube end is up when we put together the bottle so when the ""Dr. Brown"" words are facing up, the bottle wont leak. Works like a charm.  Hope this makes sense. I am sleep deprived and exhausted but had to leave this message for any other weary mom who is just about to give up.  My husband was about to spend over $125 on new bottles so I'm very glad I found this out.  HOpe this helps someone too.",4
DadGear Backpack Diaper Bag - Red Retro Stripe,"Pros: lots of pockets, hooks on to stroller easily, good distribution of items in the bag.Cons: zippers feel like they won't last long, they stick a little and I just got it. I use cloth diapers and would love for the hammock to be a little bigger to accommodate 5 cloth diapers. I can only fit 4 all in ones.",4
Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Wipes Refill 350ct.,"I have used a few brands and so far these are the best compared to pampers sensitive.They are sturdy and seem to wipe away more per swipe than the pampers, which seem to just move ""stuff"" around.They don't have any odor, and I like that they are chlorine free.They seem to be a little more expensive than other brands, however, you can use fewer wipes because they are so good.",5
"The Gro Company Grosuit Fluffy Clouds (White, 3 - 6 Months ) [Baby Product]",Bought the suit to go with my grobag and its very comfortable and my baby is not overheating. We have the air condition on which goes down to almost 16 degrees Celsius and my baby is happy and cozy with just the suit (no undergarment needed per gro company's website) and grobag 2.5 TOG. Plus it comes with 2 suits so I have extra handy for those wet nights,5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink","I bought this for my baby to keep his food warm. Before this item, i was using my friend's Zojirushi. I was pleased when i received the product and so i proceeded to wash it the first time. To my dismay, the lid could not be dismantled, which would have been possible with the zojirushi. I emailed thermos and they confirmed only the gasket could be removed. The gap between the lid and the gasket is too narrow for a sponge to reach and give it a good scrub. As this item is for my baby and hygiene is compromised, i cannot bring myself to give any additional stars.",1
"Ikea 36 Pcs Kalas Kids Plastic BPA Free Flatware, Bowl, Plate, Tumbler Set, Colorful","My kids love these. They love that I let them use knives (they're 2 and 4)! Forks and spoons are probably a bit too large/long for my 2-yr-old but he MUST do whatever his older bro does, so of course he uses them anyway. We've used these (approximately) a million times since purchase 8 mos ago and still love the whole set. All the colors are fun!",5

green sprouts Silicone Baby Toothbrush,Wish I'd seen this sooner!  My son is one now but I wish I'd had this all along.  I love that it's built like a normal toothbrush so there's no transition really when he's ready for a true brush.  The round plate keeps him from shoving down his throat.  Great all around!,5
Kids Line Organic Willow Throw Pillow,"The pillows are small, and aren't very full, but they are absolutely adorable, and complete the look of the set.",5
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","I got the medium wet bag and it is small enough to toss in my diaper bag, but also holds about a days worth of dirty diapers when filled all the way up (about 12 diapers and a couple covers). I like using the wet bag because when it's time to wash diapers, I just toss the diapers in and the wet bag.I would suggest line drying the wet bag to protect and prolong the life of the PUL. If you are going to dry in the dryer, make sure to put the PUL back inside the bag (it usually comes out in the wash) and zipper shut so it doesn't get burned or messed up in the dryer.The bag itself is really cute, high quality and well made.",4

Fisher Price Fisher Price Fastfinder Deluxe Messenger Bag,We haven't actually used this yet since the baby hasn't arrived but it seems perfect. I wanted a diaper bag that my husband wouldn't be embarrassed carrying around and this is it. It matches everything and has many convenient pockets.

Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics: Snap-Lock Beads - Vehicle Shapes,These are awesome and very good for my special needs child.  He can put them together and pull them apart - great motor skill toy.  The reason for the 4 star rating is that you should be aware that one set doesn't go a long way.  We have three sets and that is enough to make a couple of necklaces.,4
Philips AVENT Digital Screen Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,my wife & i spent a lot of time researching different baby monitors & are extremely happy w/ this one.  very clear sound & easy to use.  both my wife & i are deep sleepers so if the sound doesnt wake us up the flashing lights do.  unit has good range as we found ourselves working outside on more than one occasion while she slept.,5

She would not sleep without them....BUT one day she got it stuck in her mouth! I didnt even know a babies mouth could fit that...so I guess these are ok as long as your baby isnt like mine.,3
"Sunshine Kids Dry Seat Pad, Grey","I recieved a Sunshine Kids Juvenile Products Dry Seat Waterproof Seat pad to review and I've got to say I'm somewhat impressed! Though a word of caution for use in carseats. You should NEVER use any aftermarket products not designated for use by your specific carseat manufacturer. We do own and use a Sunshine Kids Radian XTSL carseat and we'll be trying this out this as an add-on to this seat. Especially when we start potty training our youngest.I don't however se it fitting in the seat very well with the toddler body suppot pillow in place. I tried it out in our oldest sons old Evenflo Generations 65 and it seemed to fit alright. One drawback I can see for use in ANY carseat is that it may cause difficulty in getting proper harness fit. It may be better for use in a belt-positioning booster vs. a 5pt harness seat.To test the ""waterproof"" claim I decided to open my rockin' Klean Kanteen and dump a good amount of water in soaking the pad quite a bit. It did infact contain the water within the seat cover keeping the underside dry.The only drawback I can see would be if somehow water and or any other liquid was spilled directly over the buckle the seat underneath would get wet. Though not really a design flaw or anything that can be done differently either. There is a nice little guard area that should help minimize that where the buckle comes through the dry seat pad. I soaked the pad about an hour and a half ago and it's still fairly wet, I'm not sure how long it will take to air dry completely. Overall I like this product, but I'm not in love with it. I would recommend this for someone who is looking for something to keep their stroller seats dry or for a belt positioning (Sunshine Kids only!) booster, not for use in a carseat that uses a harness system.",4
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","I originally purchased these bags on a trial basis.  I wanted a diaper Genie, but heard that they don't really cover up the smell and were difficult to use.  The bags have a light baby powder scent that really helps with those stinky diapers.  BUT...when you have so many, the smell will eventually come through.  Therefore, you need to empty the garbage on a regular.  I love the small size.  They fit into a zipper compartment in my diaper bag and come in so handy when I'm out and about.  Because of the powder smell, I don't feel bad when throwing them away at a friends house.  So far, one box of 200 is lasting for a while.  My son is 3 months old and I still have plenty left.  I plan to buy more when necessary.  You can't beat the great price!!!",5
"JJ Cole Travel Pod Set, Cocoa Tree","I was originally looking for just a pacifier pod, this was listed in the also bought. I don't use the the bottle cooler since I use powder formula on the go. The pod keeps my spare pacifier clean, and the diaper tote is great for those quick trips when you don't want to take a full size (and heavy) diaper bag. I am able to get about four Size 2 diapers, the changing pad (included), a travel container of wipes (Huggies), and there is a handy outside pocket that I keep a travel pack of disinfecting wipes in. They all have snap handles that I have found useful. All are easy clean, the pod, tote, and changing pad can all be tossed into the wash. The bottle cooler is just a quick wipe down. I love this item and would gladly purchase it again!",5

Sassy Sensation Station Suction Toy,"A friend of ours gave us a suction cup toy for my son who just turned three months old.  After attaching it to his high chair and seeing how excited he was to play with something while sitting up, I went to find some similar toys.  I found this one at Target and figured I'd give it a try even though it said 6+ months on it.  He LOVES it.  It spins and plays sounds and music with every bat of the hand, it has really started to improve his ability to grasp objects as well.  The suction cup works very well on both the high chair tray and the small tray that attaches to his swing.  I'm looking forward to buying him several of these types of toys so we can rotate them and keep him entertained.",5

Graco Baby SnugGlider Infant Car Seat Swing Frame,"I bought this swing as a way to save space and have something portable, and this does both!  For the first month, we used this almost every night.  The motor is on the noisier side, but it actually seemed to be soothing for my daughter.  The clicking is like a metronome (or like an odd heartbeat, if you want to think of it that way - rhythmic).  As she got a bit older, we didn't use it at night but she still enjoyed some time in it, and if she wouldn't fall asleep any other way, this worked.  I was able to store it under the bed and get it out when we needed it.  Now it lives by the back door, and when she's asleep from the car ride, I can click her in and she stays asleep.  I don't use the powered swinging as much anymore, but when the seat is in the swing and my daughter stirs, it rocks a bit and helps soothe her back to sleep.  It does take some practice to get the seat in the swing smoothly, though.  I can't say much for the music and vibration; I don't use them.The motor did fail at some point, but I contacted Graco and they quickly sent a replacement, no hassle.A couple tips for the swing:1. Once you turn it on, give it a push to get it going.  It's much easier for the motor to synchronize with it already swinging than it is to start from a standstill.  I've read some reviews that say the swing doesn't move on low and moves too fast on high, and I think this helps.  It's worked well on all the levels for me.  When my daughter was newborn, we had it just barely on, and it had a nice, gentle, rock.  I have had to turn the motor up a little bit to compensate for her growth, but I think that's to be expected; I still don't turn it all the way up (she's 11 months and above average size for her age).2. Put the handlebar back.  It definitely throws the balance off a bit when it's up and I've found it to be much smoother when I've put it back.  Really the only times I've had the swinging action stop on me while the motor was still running is when I had the handlebar up.I think I figured out both of these after killing that first motor; I've had no problems with the new one.",4
"JJ Cole Car Seat Cover, Khaki","I can't understand how this is supposed to keep my baby warm in the NY winter. No way. I can't imagine how freezing It would get for those in colder areas and this just won't make the cut, I'm sure.Sooo simple solution. Get the Bundle Me and simply cut the parts that obstruct and sit behind your baby. Then sew the edges so the filler doesn't come out. Set it up on the seat without obstructing the straps. DONE! Warm baby and very safe.",1
Full Coverage all-in-one Hands-Free Pumping Bra &amp; Nursing Tank by Rumina Nursingwear - Black Medium,"Still on the hunt for the perfect hands free bra/tank. Pretty sure it doesn't exist but this comes the closest. When the bottle is getting full , it tends to lose suction and then you have to hold it anyway. The tank is very thick, which is both nice and cumbersome, when wearing under clothes. However, the company is wonderful! Offered me a coupon for ordering again, but I just don't need it. I would order true to size, I ordered it too big as well. If anything go smaller.",3
Sunshine Kids Cool It 2 Cooler,"great price if it worked. great size however zipper is broken, therefore items cant stay cooled.Therefore doesn't do the job.",2
Britax Car Seat Storage Pouch,Great place to store extra things needed. Plenty of room quality well made. Glad we have this for our seat. Happy with it,5
"Baby K'tan Baby Carrier, Black, X-Large","this is great for me. iordered a small (i am 5'5 and 125 lbs) and as soon as i figured out the trick to getting my son into a good position he will now fall asleep in this as soon as he is in. the only downfall i would say is according to the website and sizing  the smal should fit my husband who is 6'2 and 180 lbs. its too small for him. i had toorder him a seperate one  (baby k'tan breeze, ) in the medium. that seems to be slightly  big as my son is only 6 weeks old but it fits my husband much better than the small.",4
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"We used the snap-n-go when they first came out...liked it then.  Now with our third child we rec'd the newer version.  We have an Eddie Bauer carrier.  The booklet that comes with it shows the carrier and gives instructions on placement.  The problem is that the Eddie Bauer carrier is only held in place by a strap - it DOES NOT LOCK INTO PLACE, like all of the other carriers would.  Now, it may seem that why not use just the strap - well, the strap is the SECOND saftey mechanism for the seat...and really should not be used as the only one b/c when you move the stroller the seat moves around....the latch is for a reason, and if you cannot securely latch the carrier - they should NEVER instruct you to be able to use it - just to make the $$.  We're returning it!  Sorry but our child's safety should be their concern...too!",1
Medela Freestyle Breast Pump,"I am extremely happy with this pump. I am a working mom with a 5 month old at home and am determined to breastfeed my baby for a year. I have a very busy schedule and my work requires me to travel. With this pump I dont have to worry about all that. I can use it easy and quick. I use the double pump and hands free feature. It works great. I would recommend it to any working mom. The price is a little high, but it is worth every cent.",5
Evenflo Bounce and Learn Bee Exersaucer,"First of all, this jumper is pretty stylish - it's not an eyesore. All of the toys are detachable so even once your baby is too big for the bouncer you can take the plush monkey off, you can take the 3 play stations off, and they can play with them. It has 3 different levels; my baby is on the highest one right now (level 3) and he is in 18 month clothes, just to give you an idea of his height in regards to the jumper. The cloth seat can easily be taken out and washed and dried by the machine which is convenient with a messy baby. There are two things I don't really like about this jumper. The knobs to adjust the height of the chair are extremely hard to turn - I had to put gloves on in order to turn them. And the obvious - it's pretty huge, it takes up a lot of space. It's all worth it though because he loves playing in it!",4
Tooth Fairy Box,These are so cute. The only thing I don't like is one of the lids fits snug and one is loose. We tried both lids on both boxes because we bought two. Very cute way to store the kids baby teeth.,4
Britax B-Safe Infant Car Seat Extra Base,New base - works like the old base...This is an identical item to the original as shipped with the B-Safe car seat.,5
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","My son loves this teether! I call it his ""razzle dazzle berry"" and he gets so excited when it's in front of him. Although, I'm not positive, I think that it has actually weaned him from his regular binky. He loves to chew on all of them now and isn't interested in sucking them. I know a lot of parents want to wean their kids of the binky, but I wasn't ready for that since he needs to suck to sleep. Like I said, I can't say it was this teether, but it did happen shortly after he started chewing it.",5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",I bought this stroller for my 2 1/2 year old twin boys who have outgrown their Graco DuoGlider. My son who sat on the back jump seat looked somewhat comfortable but there is no back/head rest. My son who sat in the front seat was very uncomfortable! His feet kept touching the wheels and the seat is VERY shallow! I would only recommend this stroller for short rides and the front seat only for infants.,2
KidCo Configure Gate 24&quot; Extension,"I ordered a KidCo Elongated child gate. A recommended extension needed to be purchased. The wrong extension was sent. I needed G24 model and received 24"""" extension for a different model.",1
"Cosco Juvenile Funsport Play Yard, Kontiki",I purchased the playpen for my teacup puppy an it is perfect for him.  Very attractive and sturdy.  It is easy to set up.  I can easily pick up the end and roll it to wherever I wish to have it.  If I had purchased it for a child I would like to see a bit more padding on the top rails.  For what I need it is great.,5
"Gro Baby  Shell Set, Vanilla","I have several of these and have 3 inserts for each shell.What I love about this diaper:1. Pretty! There are lots of bright, attractive colors and patterns. We have ""boy"" and ""girl"" patterns. I love them all!2. Non-irritating velcro. The tabs are not scratchy and won't irritate baby's skin. They're almost smooth to the touch!3. Perfect laundry tabs. They fold right over on themselves!4. Overlapping tabs. If you have a skinny baby, the tabs will fasten on top of each other for a snug fit.5. Elastic in the liner. There is elastic around the legs to help hug the liner to your baby.6. Snap-in liners. No more bunching up! These liners snap right in to the shell.7. Slim in the middle. Cloth diapers are bulkier than disposables. Period. When our baby wears these, I can tell by the way she is walking. They are slimmer than the other AIO (all in one)'s we have tried and I really like that!What I would change:1. We have LOTS of ""leakage"" from the liner to the shell. The elastic helps, but if the baby poops, chances are we are going to have to rinse and change the shell. We don't often make it through a day without going through at least 4 shells. With other AIO systems, we can make it through a day with 2 shells.2. Taller rise. Our baby is short and chunky. At 15 months old, she is totally unsnapped, so the rise will not go any higher for her. She may outgrow these before any of our other cloth diapers. These were the first we had to go up in size every time she grew, also.3. Wing droop. With the velcro closures, there is nothing to hold the wings up - the part that is tucker under and around your baby's belly. With the snaps, this is addressed, but the velcro leaves some hanging wings on skinny babies. Our chunky baby doesn't have much of an issue with it, but it could be troublesome if your baby isn't full-figured. :-)Overall, I really like these. Very functional, but you might need a few shells more than other AIO systems. :-)",4
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink","When I opened this product I noticed that the chair was clean and didn't seem to have any rips and is overall in great shape.However, the right arm seam was spread open about a centimeter wide by about 7 inches down the side. This was quickly fixed with a hammer, but is the only reason I didn't give this chair a 5 out of 5. This tear at the seem could have been from shipping so it might not come this way to everyone?My son is 10 months old and tall for his age, he has a lot of room to grow in this chair and can use it comfortably now. The only thing I recommend is removing the glider pieces on the bottom (two screws) if your child isn't old enough to sit still, as it would definitely topple over if a toddler crawled up the back of the chair. I plan to put these pieces back on once he is older.",4
"Kushies Waterproof Bib, Blue Circle, Infant","I have been through quite a few bibs, and each had its pros and cons.  These are perfect.  They are lightweight, so my son doesn't get hot and fussy wearing it.  The pocket sticks out far enough to actually be useful, just without being made of hard uncomfortable rubber like the Bjorn.  The prints are cute but still neutral.  They are waterproof and machine washable.  I leave one in my diaper bag and just wipe it down at the restaurant before storing it.  That way I always have a clean bib in the bag, without all the fuss of remembering to replace it.",5
"My Pool Pal Reusable Swim Diaper, Pink, 2T","Our potty-trained kiddo is required to wear a swim diaper in lessons, and the fit of the iPlay brand was just not working. I was thrilled to find My Pool Pal as an alternative. The cut is similar to a traditional swimsuit, and fits FAR better onto our preschooler's frame. For reference, kiddo wears 100 or 110 at Hanna, and a 4T or 5T in most brands.",5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Pink",My 3 month old will play on this for 30 minutes or more at a time. She loves to look at herself in the mirror and kick the piano to make the music. I love that it can grow with the child and isn't just for infants. The piano can detach for an older child to carry around which is a great feature.,5
Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub,"I bought this tub after my baby outgrew her infant tub. It worked well and I always felt safe with the big inflated sides keeping her safe. The only drawback is that it popped after about 6 months. That was 6 months of daily use so I suppose it held up well for being an inflatable item. However, I am going to go with a standard plastic tub going forward so I don't have to worry about buying a new tub every 6 months.",3
"The First Years Compass B540 Booster Seat, Abstract O's","I bought a B540 and a B530 at the same time for our son, one each for my and my wife's cars.  At first I was thrilled!  They are light, apparently very well made, and get a fantastic NHTSA rating.  One drive, however, pointed out a major design flaw: tipping.Our son is a few months shy of his 4th birthday, weighs about 40 pounds, and stands about 38"" tall.  He is very quiet in his car seat and doesn't squirm around at all.  He loves being able to (at the appropriate time) undo his own latch and get out of the car himself.  The arm rests and cup holders are also big hits with him.What he doesn't like and what scares the (bad word) out of us is even moderate cornering speeds cause the chair to tip over.  Since this system uses only the shoulder and lap belts to hold both child and chair in place, anytime the vehicle moves with less force than trips the seatbelt tensioner or locking mechanism both child and chair are free to slide around to the extent a freely moving seatbelt allows.  That turns out to be quite a lot.Yesterday was a perfect example.  When leaving daycare I made a concerted effort to take up as much seatbelt slack as possible as an experiment to see if I could prevent the tipping.  Maybe one minute later I left a stoplight making a left-hand turn.  By the turn's exit my son was at a 45 degree angle to the right and kind of freaking out about it.  The turn had been nowhere near enough to cause the seatbelt to lock yet the centrifugal force almost completely tipped him and the seat on their sides.  I keep wondering what would happen if I swerved to avoid an obstacle and then had to slam on the brakes.  The rapid turn would almost certainly dump the chair over, causing the restraints to be BADLY misaligned during a panic stop.  Who knows what would happen if that was followed by a collision.I have resorted to placing the seat in an outboard position behind the driver's chair.  This allows it to sit in the depression formed by the contouring of the car's seats.  Placing the booster chair in the middle position, the safest place in an accident, puts it on a slight hump and makes this problem so bad as to be literally unusable.  It is tipping on virtually every corner, enough to cause my son's eyes to widen.I called Learning Curve and the rep said she had not heard of such a problem.  After checking with an engineer I was told I probably had the seatbelt misaligned or the seat installed incorrectly, neither of which is true (the seats are VERY easy to install).  The only option she suggested was moving up to either their model B570 or B830, both of which are significantly more expensive but feature mounting hardware.I cannot fathom why these seats are not either anchored or designed with a wider base to prevent tipping.  The anchor points would not need to be terribly robust as restraint during an accident would still be handled by the belt.  I had briefly thought about running a bungee cord between the rear LATCH points, passing it through the fold where the lower seat meets the backrest, but my concerns about safety being untested with that configuration were echoed by the Learning Curve rep.I drive and Acura RDX, my wife has a Ford Focus.  I have leather seats, she has cloth.  Our vehicles interior designs are completely different yet we both experience the same issue.  As it stands I cannot and would not recommend these seats to anyone until the issue of tipping during moderate lateral acceleration has been addressed.  Both seats will be returned to Amazon; I have not yet decided what their replacements will be.",1
"DaVinci Thompson 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry",Just bought this crib from Amazon.Was delivered super fast (may be because we are in California).Good:1.)

DwellStudio Baby Transportation Hooded Towel,"I bought this for my 8 month old since he out grew the infant ones.  We LOVE this.  It is soft, well made and a decent size.  We will be able to use it for quite some time.  The pattern is adorable too!",5
OsoCozy Unbleached Organic Flannel Baby Wipes 12 pack,"We love these and use them with the Prince Lionheart wipes warmer. We were so busy with our newborn that we actually just wet these, wrung them out, and then just scrunched them up and threw them in the warmer (no time to fold them!), which has worked great for the last couple months. One wipe goes a long way with newborn poop. We usually only need to use one for each diaper change. They wash easily and well - we haven't had any staining. We purchased 24 and this seems to be enough given that we're doing laundry ever 2-3 days. You might want more depending on your laundry habits.",5
Kid-ding Waterproof Multi-Use Pads - 18&quot; x 27&quot; - 4 Pack,Very useful item. We use them to protect the bassinet mattress as well as on top of the changing pad and under the changing pad cover. We have also used them when giving our newborn a sponge bath. The pads are absorbent and can be washed in the washing machine. The size is good.,5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"In my opinion this is the best tub for babies. It fit perfect on my kitchen sink, which made bath time highly convenient.  It is also the perfect size.  And the foam mat that is inside it made it so baby does not slide around. It is also reclined perfectly to keep baby in the perfect position. I got this for a shower gift for my first baby.  Then I got another tub for my second child 2 yrs later.  I ended up putting away the new one and sending my husband to the storage unit to get this one back out.  I love this tub and would reccommend it to anyone.  The only problem that I would have with it is the foam does not come out so it could harbor bacteria. I just always made sure to rinse it with antibacterial soap and HOT water after every use. No other tub compares!!",5

"Infantino Flip Front 2 Back Carrier, Black","I bought this so that I can take my 6 month old on hikes with me, and it says that it was meant for front or rear facing positions.  In rear position, it is very unsafe for baby, and there is no safe way to put it on or take it off either.  My baby fell out of the carrier while attempting to take it off, an I have not used it since, it's garbage.  Luckily she was not hurt.",1

Lamaze Tug &amp; Play Activity Knot Take Along Toy,"The brown triangle is a fuzz that is easy for our son to pull out with his teeth. He has always liked biting fuzzy things and trying to pull the fuzz out.

"Diono Monterey Booster Seat, Blue","I have only bought Britax carseats for my children until I discovered the Diono Monterey Booster. I was looking for a seat that has LATCH tethers, great safety ratings by the Institute for Highway Safety, and is stylish. The Monterey boasted all of these qualities AND garnered rave reviews from parents. I am so glad I made the switch from Britax because my kids and I love these seats. They fit nicely on the back seats of my Audi Q5 and are very comfortable. I received seats with a manufacture date of March 2013 so I have not experienced any issues with the seatbelt threading through the headrest that some posters have complained about with older versions of this seat. It works perfectly!",5
"Sesame Street Potty and Step Stool Combo Set, Framed Friends","My grandchild love the Sesame street theme.  The stool is very nice and she carries it everywhere,  The potty handles on the potty seat, as most padded seats, are not high enough to craddle the child and it slides around when the child moves.  I will not use this potty seat for training, but I kept it to use for when the child is older and can sit without squirming. DN",3
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I was prepping bottles and put 5 liners into 5 bottles and one right after the other all 5 started leaking. Those were the only 5 but with how expensive they are I shouldn't have that issue. It also was extreemly frustrating having 5 in a row and milk spilling everywhere. I have since decided to switch bottles, because of the cost and the frustration. I used these with my oldest but I just don't want to deal with buying liners all the time for another 6+ months.",2

"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum",We got this for my son when we needed to switch my daughter from the infant seat to a convertible.  my son is 4 and very tall for his age.  He loves this seat.  We've taken it several times on planes and are very happy with it.  We like the low profile (my daughter can't kick the seat in front of her on the plane when she's in it) but it is heavy.  I can see some kids having a problem being able to see out the car window if they aren't as tall as my son (42&#34;).  After buying the first one and liking it we bought one for my car too.  I like that we can use it as a booster when he's older but we'll keep him in the 5 point harness as long as we can.,5
BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector,Love this item! My car stays clean and I don't have to worry about stains on my seat. I use it with my grace myride 65 and it is still big enough to collect the things my son drops. It's perfect!!!,5
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips spill Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","Back when he was just a teensy sprout, my now 13-year-old developed a fascination for these sippy cups. Didn't have to be a specific color, but it had to be THIS CUP. Personally, I love them because a bottle brush gets in there to clean the corners and the valves aren't complicated mechanisms that leave you knowing *knowing* that there's goo in there somewhere you will never get to. Ugh. These valves are just a little rubber x, yet still highly effective. the tops are solid enough to take repeated gnawing without failing, and the entire thing will survive being tossed out of windows and off of playground equipment. Believe me, I know this.See, my son became so attached, he named this cup continuum. I have no idea why, but the kid would introduce himself to new people, then introduce his cup as &#34;Dieter&#34; (pronounced &#34;Deeeter&#34;. Apparently, these cups are German?) All I know is that the kid went on adventures with his trusty sidekick-- a plucky cup who was bad at following instructions, but had a good heart. A heart filled with water, milk or very occasionally half-filled with juice. Dieter and my kid finally parted ways one day at Legoland when the last known Dieter in the house went overboard on the lake, and the crew couldn't reach it with the net-pole-hybrid fishy thing. We spent the next few years following his progress around the world's waterways on the world map. Here's to you, little buddy.Since that time, though, I've managed to spawn one more offspring-- this one is fresh and shiny and eleven months old as of this writing. She now has a set of Dieters ready to adventure-- we wondered, will she like them? Will she use them? Will my kids share the same taste in plastic cup buddies even if they were born so far apart?Yep. She's taken to them swimmingly and was last seen stealing away her dessert of a couple of ounces of orange juice to figure out how to return to scaling the furniture with Dieter in hand. No new name yet though. I'll keep you posted.",5
BRICA Roll 'n Go Car Seat Transporter,"I wanted to love this product.  I really did -- cheaper to purchase than the Go Go Babyz Travelmate, which was why I selected it for my recent trip, and very light and maneuverable.  The product was very easy to use -- we attached it to my Diono Radian carseat and strapped my 17-pound 9-month old in, and it did great throughout the airport and stowed quickly and easily on the airplane.Unfortunately, on the return trip a plastic piece inside the transporter must have broken, because one of the wheels collapsed inward when I was getting off of the airport train and my daughter almost took a header into the ground were it not for some kind people behind us.  We managed to get the wheel straight so that I could get her off the train, but it was broken, and when we got home my husband did some further investigation and determined that the broken piece was not replaceable.So while I want to recommend this, I just cannot because it didn't even get me back home at the end of the trip.  :(Edit:  Contacted Brica and they stood by their product.  Shipped me a brand new one.  So I edited my stars to reflect that I did not lose any money on this product.  Still minus one for breaking when I needed it the most, but hopefully they are working on this because otherwise it's a great product.",4
Delta Children's Products Lil' Drive Baby Activity Walker,"This is the cutest activity walker ever.  I did my research and this was the best option for safety (prevents child from falling down steps) and for chubby thighs.  My son is 7 months old and he would spend all day in this walker if he could.  He loves to horn and play with the gadgets designed to help develop fine motor skills. He is afraid of the roaring engine sounds so I keep the volume turned to off.  My husband does not like the wheels at all.  We have hardwood flooring and the wheels do leave scraches.  He tried replacing the wheels, but couldn't find any rubber ones to fit.  As a compromise, we confine the little one to the kitchen.  I highly recommend this product!",4
"Dappi Waterproof 100% Nylon Diaper Pants, 2 Pack, White, Small","I mostly use the Gerber plastic covers you can get at the store, and they are fine.

"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","I've had a couple of the older models - the minor improvements such as the larger cup holder area are actually really nice.  Getting the latch system out for the first time is a bit of a chore, but not a huge deal.  This seat, unlike the older model, only has one strap for the latch system - the previous one had two short straps on each side.  I'm still not sure how I feel about it - I do think the latch is a bit harder to get tightened up in this one.  Stil, a good seat.  Its *heavy* though - a bit cumbersome if you want to move it between cars often.",5

ZoLi BOT XL Straw Sippy Cup (Green) - 9 oz.,"We ended up giving the three Zoli Bot cups we bought away.  This cup is a mini volcano with milk constantly rising to the straw top and spilling over, creating pools of milk around it.  You can only loosen the lid to relieve the pressure so many times per day before calling it quits.  We went back to the Munchkin straw cup.  It leaks if the kiddo throws it on the ground, but that's preferable to than the cup that leaks on its own.",1
"Disney Sophia 4 Piece The First Toddler Set, Sweet As A Princess",My 3 yr old loved it when she opened it for Christmas.  We got a great Lightning Deal on it and it's great.  Is it high thread count - no but unless you're royalty or something...a 3 yr old is not going to know the difference.  Besides - it's more about the looks than anything and that is why we bought it.,5

I am really satisfied with the shipping time it took to come to my house but the quality of the bag isn't that great.

Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"The infant optics baby monitor isn't a top end model, but for the money it is a great buy.- it has very good video quality without any lag- the automute function removes the static noise - great to use if you are a light sleeper- the night vision is excellent- very light handheld unit if you plan to move this around at home- the options and menu are very straight forward to any anti-hightech users- it comes with a plastic mount for the camera to point downwards.... and it works well if you put the camera on an elevated furnitureThe only complain I want to say is the battery doesn't last very long. I would recommend getting another power cord if you plan to use this other than your bedroom.",5

CJs BUTTer Tube o BUTTer Plus,"I originally got this to use as diaper cream with our cloth diapers.  It works great and clears up rashes that other cloth diaper safe creams just couldn't get rid of.  Once I saw how great it worked for the diaper rash I started using it on other things such as cuts and dry skin.  It's amazing, I'd been trying to get rid of bumpy dry skin on my son for months and if I put this on each night and morning it clears right up.  I even use it on my own face at night now.  I've had acne for years and I guess it was because of dry skin because after a week of using this it's so much clearer.This has been added to my standard list of things to get new moms at baby showers because I think everyone needs to have it in their back pocket.",5
The Ultimate Baby Wrap in Navy,"Come on, MOMS! This wrap is softer, more flexible, more comfortable and logical than ANY OTHER wrap available (at least in the U.S. market). My wife and I have tried two well-advertised others, and could never get them ""to work"". We were delighted to discover this one. Yes, it circles you a few times, and yes, it takes a bit of practice to feel safe, and move child around inside, and take them out if they fell asleep, but - again - there is no better, more cuddly, smart design out there. Forget Baby Bjorn and other carriers: those are COMPLETELY different, in their design, intent and functionality. Yes, Bjorn is better than the Disney crap and many others brands, but comparing a wrap to a carrier shows lack of carrier understanding and ignorance of a wrap's history. Trust a heavyset, easily sweating father (and my scientist wife agreed): this is the only and the best to get! Enjoy.",5
Sunshine Kids Easy View Back Seat Mirror,"I didn't think I needed a mirror for my car but after stressing with a fussing baby I couldn't see while driving I quickly changed my mind! This mirror works great! I have a newer Toyota Camry and it fits around the backseat headrest great. The mirror is a little stiff so it takes a moment to get it to swivel into place but that is good, on bumps it doesn't loose it's adjustment. The size is great too, just right.",5
"The First Years True Choice A100 Digital Monitor, One Parent Unit","I was a bit on the fence about purchasing this product because of all the more expensive alternatives. I of course wanted to make sure it would work well. However; after receiving this product I was more than pleased to see how petite and sleek the item is, It's hard to even tell that it's a monitor; and it works perfect, simple and effective!",5
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"It comes fully assembled and it's so easy to change the shape of the panels-which are huge when stretched out, it's sturdy and 85 pound lab proof!

Munchkin Gone Fishin' Bath Toy,"My daughter is 18 months old and quite familiar with the concept of fishing. She watches her dad fish almost daily, as we live on a lake. She was excited about this toy, but the magnetic functioning that enables the lure to &#34;hook&#34; the fish is so weak, if they do connect, it's only briefly. This causes unnecessary frustration and disappointment. I would not recommend this toy.",1

"Diono RadianR100 Convertible Car Seat, Dune","I am a grandma and do a lot of babysitting.  I need to get three carseats in the back of a PT Cruiser (I know, good luck!) since another grandchild is on the way.  I ordered a Radian, knowing that I would hate it.  It is heavy, doesn't stand up by itself, and the buckle is difficult to undo.  However, I went into it knowing these facts, and have no choice.  When I received the car seat, the bottom LATCH is broken.  It is stuck in the closed position and won't open to &#34;grab&#34; the latchbar.  I didn't know whether to let Amazon know, or if Diono was the place to contact.  So I tried Diono first since it is their product.  I had to leave voice mails for customer service so I left 2 of them.  One had my cell # and then about 4 hours later, I left my home #.  No calls in 4 days.  I sent two emails, the first asking 2 questions about usage (before I tried it in the car and discovered the LATCH problem), then the second describing the problem.  3 days later, no answer again.  I have tried customer service again and the only option so far is to leave a message.  I then called Amazon and within about 3 minutes, I had a return shipping label in my email and another seat on the way.  I called Monday and my new seat is being delivered tomorrow (Wednesday).  Great service Amazon!  If you have a problem with your Radian, if my experience is any indication, don't expect ANYTHING from Diono, not even a call back to discuss the problem!!  If I could give them a &#34;0&#34; rating, I would.",1
"Boba Air Baby Carrier, Black","I purchased this Boba Air last month and wore it traveling over the holidays. For anyone thinking of buying one...it stinks. The straps are not comfortable as they have zero padding so they pull and cut into your shoulders. It also gaps a lot on the sides so it's awkward to nurse without draping a blanket over the gaping hole. I bought this because I wanted something lighter than the Ergo as it was too large for my frame. For now, I am going back to my Moby as it's still the most comfortable one I have worn so far. The material doesn't breathe as it's a nylon wind-breaker type material so it gets very hot.",1
"Britax B-Nimble Stroller, Red",I was very pleased with the stroller and the ease of its use. The cup holder doesn't stay on very well.,4
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","I really like this stroller!  It isn't horribly heavy, but it does have some weight.  I chose orange so I could use it on trails during hunting season.  It folds pretty small and the wheels come off easily to make it smaller.  It comes assembled, except you have to pop on the wheels.  I would not use this on two-tracks or really uneven terrain because with 3 wheels, it could tip easily.  It has a 5 point harness system, which is nice.  I just clip toys and a pacifier on it.  Once you are comfortable with the stroller, you can pop it open with one hand!  I use this as an every day stroller.  I even use it for shopping - I just put my items in the basker under it.  You can't put a ton of stuff there, but $50 worth of groceries will fit.  This stroller turns on a dime, but you need to have the room to turn around since it is pretty long.  I also have the adapter for the Graco Snugride 35 carseat, the cupholder, and the weather shield.  I think those items are overpriced, but I like them all.  I would buy this again.",5

Boppy Maternity Support Band - Medium/Large,"I purchased this when I was about 6 mos pregnant and found it to be very helpful when I go on walks with the dog. Previously I felt a kind of uncomfortable weight or pressure in my lower abdomen, and had to walk slower than normal. This belly band provides support, holds my belly tight and keeps me from feeling jiggly. It was a little tricky to put on the 1st 1 or 2 times but got the hang of it. It doesn't stick to my clothes or scratch my skin. I bought small/medium. Prior to pregnancy I was approx a size 6 -8 in pants size and I've by 6 mos I had gained ~15#.",5
"Aurora Baby Blessings Plush, Lamb",I used this a part of a decoration on a Diaper Cake for a shower I hosted. The lamb is sweet and the ribbon is such a sweet touch,5
"Boppy Total Body Pillow with Slipcover, Natural","After much thought and countless hours of research to find the best maternity pillow for my wife I settled on this one. We were very satisfied with Boppy's nursing pillow with our first child that I assumed the quality would be the same with this product. Was I mistaken! As soon as we took it out of the package and opened it up, it looked so limp and flat from the start. It offered no support at all! I was considering keeping it and filling it myself, but I realized for the price, I shouldn't have to do that. Even cheap pillows would have more filling. Do not believe what you see in the picture. I thought that it would be as supportive as their best-selling pillow. I gave it two stars rather than one only because I liked the shape and design of this pillow and the fact that it came with a pillow case. I cannot begin to tell you how disappointed I am with Boppy. I normally read and don't write any reviews, however, I was so unhappy with this product I needed to let the public know. Please reconsider if you were expecting a quality product.",2
"Bummis Bio-Soft Liner, Small","We use them in our all in ones, but they wad up pretty quick and only catch a portion of the the poo. Almost not worth the time to throw it in there. Not to mention they are only half the price of a disposable diaper per sheet (using subscribe and save)",3
Rockin' Green Classic Rock Lavender Mint Revival 45oz,"After beginning cloth diapering, I discovered we have extremely hard water, as evidenced by the strong ammonia smell coming from our diapers about 4 weeks or so.  I was using Allen's at the time and would have to strip with Calgon.  After switching to this product, I no longer have to strip monthly.  More like every 3 or 4 months.  This detergent is a little more costly than some other brands, but worth it to me in time and water saved.",5
"Graco LiteRider Classic Connect Stroller, Pasadena",I bought this couple of months ego. It is very nice and my son loves it so much. Best value for the better price.,5
Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Silicone Nipple - Medium Flow - 2 Pack,"The slow flow were just way to slow for my son at this point so we moved to the medium flow.  (he would take 35 - 45 minutes to feed 6 oz).  The packaging suggests babies 3 - 6 month babies should be able to handle this flow.  My son was a week shy of 3 months when we switched from the slow to the medium flow.  It took him a good 2 weeks to get use to it, he would spill a lot of formula out of his mouth, and spit up a lot more but now he is a pro.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Early Walker Wearable Blanket, Baby Blue, Large","I read many of the reviews which said that this sleep sack was big, so I ordered the smaller (large) size for my 18m old. It was ridiculously big and there is no way my son could safely wear it. He is very tall for his age- 34 inches and he couldnt walk in it as it was dragging along the ground. The quality is very nice, we have always used Halo Sleep sacks, but this I had to return as the sizing was so far off. I do not recommend you buy this unless you intend to use it for a 2 or 3 yr old.",1
"Crazy Cuddly Wolf Melamine Spoon, Crazy Cuddly Wolf","these are so cute, I wish there were matching forks!  I bought 2 of these and after 3 months, 1 of them broke. It is a somewhat hard plastic. I wash them in the dishwasher about 3-4 times/week so heavy use might explain the breaking.  The one we have left still looks like new and our kids enjoy using it.",4
Fisher-Price Stride to Ride Walker,"We bought this walker for our son when he was 10 months old. It's terrible and I am surprised that Fisher-Price would market such a dangerous toy! It's too heavy in the front and tips easily. If you use it on a hard floor, it moves way too fast for a beginner walker. My son tried to walk with it and fell flat on his face! The wheel popped off a couple of times. And the space between the two legs is too narrow and my son kept getting his feet caught in the legs!The only saving grace to this terrible toy is the fact that my son likes to press the nose to hear the music!VERY DISAPPOINTING!Kathy - mom to 2 yr old",1

"Baby Jogger City Classic Single Stroller, Black &amp; Stone","I got this stroller to replace two former jogging strollers that just didn't meet my needs.  I am so happy that after tons of research I decided to go with the Baby Jogger City Classic.  The pros: Deep seat (big enough for a large two year old- with more room to grow), huge sun shade, flat seat recline, super easy fold with one hand, compact when folded (only takes up half the trunk of my Ford Escape), great for brisk walking on uneven sidewalks, roomy basket underneath and back of seat pocket, see-through windows in sun shade, 14in. back tires are not as bulky as standard 16in. jogger, adjustable handle bar, plenty of leg room for child. The cons: not made for serious jogging, smaller rear tires not as sturdy as the large 16in. tire on typical joggers, larger tires=smoother ride (but also more bulky if using in the mall or fitting in trunk of car), no cup holder (but I bought a great one at Babies R US for $6), rear of seat of this stroller is not vented when reclined- it's just solid material all the way around which doesn't allow for good air-flow on a hot day.  The demo. video on the Baby Jogger website shows a different version (maybe the City Elite) with a vented seat.  I bought this one thinking the seat was vented, but was disappointed that wasn't the case... Other than that one feature that I would've liked, this stroller is Great!  It is a much better value than BOB and has just as many features.  I'm very satisfied with my Baby Jogger.  Also- it has a jump seat that you can purchase if you have a baby and a toddler and don't like the bulk of an enormous double stroller.",4
"Comfort &amp; Harmony Mombo Deluxe Covered Nursing Pillow, Enchanting Elephants","First off, let me say that a nursing pillow is a must-have in my book for a newborn.  It allows for them to lay there and nurse (24/7) while allowing you to have 2 hands free to do other things, like eat.  It really takes a load off when nursing.  Yea, holding a little baby is no big deal...until you are doing it 24/7 for the 10th night in a row (with no end in sight), you're exhausted, still healing from giving birth, tired from having to heal, produce milk, and being a slave to your little bundle of joy.  When that time comes, it's great to be able to sit down, pull up the nursing pillow, put baby into position to nurse, then revel in the freedom your arms have to put food in your mouth, research on the iPad on all things baby, order more things from Amazon that you now realize you need, or just drop dead at your sides (don't underestimate how good this will feel).  So having said that - I would recommend this particular pillow if you have a tiny little waist.  Look at the picture and pay attention to that small little opening you have to get the pillow on.  So I have to really pull it outwards to get it around my waist, then it hugs me real tight.  The Boppy pillows are not designed like this.  The old style Boppy doesn't hold on at all and the new Boppy has a waist-strap that is completely ineffective and annoying.  Point is - I actually prefer having nothing holding onto my waist than this tension grip.  If you look at close ups of the edges of this pillow, you'll see it has a ridge sewn in all around.  This is a very pretty and nice touch, but it leaves that imprint in your waist. Maybe if I was a smaller waisted person it would be more comfortable?  Now, having pressure up against your belly can help it shrink back down, so some people might really love this feature...for me, it just wasn't all that comfortable.Other than that, this pillow is very nicely made.  It has a flatter/firmer/more organized surface than the Boppy's which seem to be more of just a pillow.  This pillow also has a vibration feature.  There's a small, round thing that vibrates.  You need to put a C battery in (not included) and put it in the middle of the pillow.  There is a zippered opening just for this purpose.  To turn it on and off, you press on it through the pillow.  Easy enough.  I'm not sure how much vibration comforted my baby, it didn't seem to be a huge factor, but it didn't hurt any and it's always good to have options.  The materials, colors, patterns on this pillow is much superior to the Boppys (old and new), but I don't like the sewn in ridged border and I did end up preferring the softer, cuddlier Boppy.  This pillow feels more like a heavily padded little platform.  A lot of this is going to be personal preference.  I do feel like this is a very high quality and extremely attractive pillow with a unique vibrating feature.I would recommend it based on that.  But personal preference...if you want something softer, cuddlier...then maybe look into the Boppy pillow.  Now I wasn't completely happy with my Boppy's either.  They are just glorified pillows - but they worked waayy better than just regular pillows.  If I had to do it again, I would try out other options.  I heard &#34;My Best Friend&#34; pillow has great reviews.  That one just seemed so big and bulky to me.",3
The Shrunks Wheeled Travel Bag,"Easy to inflate and deflate - great pump that has adapters for other size valves like air mattresses, etc.  I like how a normal sized crib sheets fits and tucks nicely in the recessed area.  Will be taking it on a 1 week trip soon.  Oh and we also bought the roller bag made for it which seems to hold not only the bed and pump, but also extra sheets, air mattresses, another inflatable pool items.  Highly recommend!",5
Baby Safe Feeder 2 Feeders &amp; 2 Bags Starter Kit,"My baby is still young, but I used this because her gums were hurting- she hates her teething ring and I'm too nervous to let her gnaw on a chunk of frozen fruit.  But at the suggestion of my husband, I put a frozen cube of milled pear that I made in the feeder and she loved it!  I didn't have to worry about her getting any chunks and unlike some feeders, these bags are mesh fabric, not plastic so no little bits to break off.  It was pretty easy to clean, just strong stream of hot water and a sponge.  It did require a few tries to get all of the bits of strained pear out, but it didn't take long at all.  Although, if left to sit for even a few minutes, I imagine it would be a great deal more difficult.  I'm very happy with this product and it's been a great way to introduce foods to my daughter (who also dislikes baby spoons!).",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"This is an ideal accessory for the infant who's big enough to fit into it.  We put our grandson in one of these 2 days before he was officially 6 months old.  He was just big enough to fit into it, and he loved it.  He was first smitten with the flashing lights with noise, and in a very short time he'd learned he could activate the light show by spinning the roller thing.  After about half an hour playing with the visual distractions, he was jumping in it.  At first he could only make a few jumps before tiring, but now, 2 months later, he can jump like a champ for longer periods, and he loves doing it.  I think this will really help get him started walking.  A great, useful toy all in all.",5
"Graco Affix Backless Youth Booster Seat with Latch System, Sailor",Love the anchor and it's a great booster seat for my 5 yr old. It's simple and pretty design was a hit with my daughter.,5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","My daughter is 11 weeks old and suffers from severe acid reflux. She cannot lay down flat or she vomits and chokes. It is definatly the scariest thing we have ever been through! She slept in her bouncy seat for about 7 weeks. She is now moving/wiggling around quite a bit and the bouncy seat is just not safe for her anymore (even with the belt on). I got the sleeper about 6 days after I ordered it. It was SUPER easy to put together, did it by myself. I set her in it and she was asleep within minutes. She LOVES it! She sleeps through the night now and is taking longer naps during the day. We are ALL getting more sleep now! It is very easy to move around the house and it fits perfectly next to my bed. It keeps her upright so she cant choke and if she rolls to her side she is still able to breathe through the mesh. It is HONESTLY the safest sleeping option for babies that cant lay flat or that do not like their crib. The best baby product we've purchased BY FAR!",5
Blue Water Teether Baby Toy,I found this exact teether in pink and blue @ the 99cent only store!!! What a great price:)great to use as a baby shower gift!!! directions say to place in the fridge but my child loves when it comes out of the freezer:),5
"Carters Snoozysnug Blanket, Green/Brown","We received so many baby blankets, but the problem I have with most is that they shed and attract fuzzies from anything else you washed or dried the blanket with.  I spend a lot of time checking my baby's hands and removing all the lint and fuzzues that accumulated from him touching or grabbing the blanket.  This Snoozysnug blanket is the only blanket so far that hasn't done so.  It is so soft and my baby loves it!  It's also nice and thick unlike most baby blankets.  Seems like this blanket will be used even in his toddler years.  I bought it in sage since I had received the yellow monkey one as a gift.  I think I'll buy more to have as backups!",5
"Jeep Deluxe All-Weather Umbrella Stroller, Carbon",I love the Jeep style design of this model and the fabric and top bonnet for rain is a really nice feature and so easy to snap on and use quickly when needed. It also has a velcro cover and you can pull that up to take a quick check on the baby without having to stop and walk to the front every time.  This window is very large and you can see well through it too.It is heavier than a basic stroller and probably is not as easy to open with one hand as the lighter ones are so I agree with another reviewer who mentioned that too. The lighter ones I have used almost fall all the way open and this needs more coaxing.  Once the seat belt (harness) is adjusted right I just open and close the one side and never have to unbuckle the whole thing.  I read that someone here had problems with the wheels on sand and other terrain but I use this mostly on sidewalks and the wheels have been really good there. This comes with one cup holder and two side bags that Velcro closed that you can put fish crackers or other snacks in easily.  There is also a large storage area under the seat that is great to store a baby blanket and things like that.  You just have to make sure nothing there is too heavy because it already hangs lower to the ground and depending on the terrain could get smashed or bump into the ground.  On the sidewalks I have no problem with it.  The foot bar seems well made and says JEEP across it which seemed like a nice touch to me.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"There are so many different ""hidden"" treasures on this toy.  I didn't even notice the embroidered ladybug under one of the wings until a couple months of Sofia using the toy.  She loves, loves, loves this one... even though she didn't get really interested in it until about 3 months of age.  She is now 5 1/2 months and still loves to play with this.Her favorite part about this toy is the crinkle noise it makes, so we have bought many, many other crinkle toys.  Still, this is her favorite.",5
Mommy's Touch One-size Touchtape All in One Cloth Diaper (Lime),"We love these diapers.  We've have several brands of diapers.  This is the only One-Size true AIO I have been able to find.  My husband is dumbfounded that I even bothered with buying pocket diapers or those with snaps.  These are always the first diapers we reach for - they require no pre-folding or stuffing.  Now, that might not sound like such a big deal but when you work full-time and are taking care of a baby, the last thing you need to worry about is stuffing and putting away diapers every other day.  After these are washed and dried, we put them in a laundry bag and keep the bag by her changing table- you can just grab them as you need them.  Plus, pulling soiled liners out of a pocket diaper is gross and why do it if it's not necessary?  These fit her great after she was about 11 lbs (we used disposables for the first few months), they never leak and she seems comfortable.  Yes - they are bulkly but all cloth diapers are - you just have to buy bigger clothes.  Give these a try - I think you'll like them!",5
Child's Maple Wood Bowl and Spoon Set,Its great that its wooden and teething babies love to chew on the spoonBut I thought that price was overly expensive.I would recommend it but if you 've got time look for bargain,3
Bright Starts Lots of Links- Solid Colors,"True to its name, the package has lots of links (24!). My 6 month old daughter likes to chew on them and they are handy for keeping toys attached to the stroller, car seat, etc. I gave four stars though because sometimes the links get easily detached.",4
Oops! Sheet Waterproof Infant Toddler Car Seat Protector Cover,"I think this is a great product, but it doesn't fit my carseat. My seat has those added head protectors that come out and are part of the seat. I already washed the lining when I realized it wouldn't work, but I did spread the cover out on the bottom part of my seat (not ideal) to use it as a piddle pad in desperation and it saved my seat when the other piddle pad on top of it leaked pee pee. Hope to see this liner in a version that fits the Safety 1st AIR seats (with the head air cushions). This is a great product especially for slightly damp children coming from pools or the beach in the summer. Very sad I can't use it the way Id like. Especially because I spent a bit of money.",4
BOB Infant Car Seat Adapter Duallie for Chicco,"This is only good until your younger infant can ride in the seat then it's absolutely useless, basically useless after 6 months. I don't understand why bob can't come up with just an adapter with no snack tray. Getting my almost 3 year old in and out of the seat is such a pain with the tray there.",2
"Luvable Friends 12 Pack Washcloths, Blue","They're a little stretchy but I have no problems with that! My baby girl loves these and they're slightly bigger (and softer!) than the baby washcloths we bought in stores. Love the fabric, great price for so many in a pack, and she's more than happy to teeth on them too.",5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","I was very excited to try these with the hopes of phasing out the disposables. I read other reviews regarding their absorbency so when I received them I put them through the wash a few times. I have had no problems at all with them not retaining fluid. However, they are quite thick and very noticeable through fitted clothing. Under lose fitting clothes is fine though. Also, not ideal for overnight simply because they are hard to keep in place.",3
Mommy's Helper Safe-er-Grip Foot Rest,"This sticks to the wall of my tile shower better than any suction cup device ever has, it hasn't come off in the 3 weeks I've been using it.  Great for shaving, not built to carry weight.",5

"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","I bought these to dispose of litter box waste. I had been using regular plastic bags from the grocery store, but found them to be flimsy and have too many holes. These are scented and are the perfect size for daily scoops.  They'd also be perfect for dogs.",5
Fisher-Price Zen Collection Gliding Bassinet,"The Zen collection is not wood, but impersonates a wooden look so if you buy it online you dont know until after you receive it, that's its plastic.I had originally registered for the collections because of wanting wood - and later found out it's not.",1
"Skip Hop Take Cover Shopping Cart/High Chair Cover, Double Dots",I have been looking for a cart cover but all the ones I found were very bulky and I couldn't imagine bring it to the store or restaurants.  I just received this and haven't use it yet (my son is not quite sitting on his own yet) but I already love it.  It isn't bulky and folds into itself.  When in the pouch I would say it is about the size of a water bottle.I will update my review if I change my mind after using it but I can't wait to give it a shot.,5
"Baby Buddy Size-It Closet Organizers, Blue, 5 Pack",Im not one to review stuff but these things work awesome! They have been stepped on(put in a bag during a move) and still perfect condition! =) love that ot comes with more stickers to replace once you need to make a bigger one! Definitely makes closet organization easier,5
"Britax B-Agile and B-Safe Travel System, Red",We have had no issues with this product at all. There was a recent safety recall on the stroller of which Britax immediately sent us a simple repair kit since our product was registered. Very good experience with our 10 months of using this product so far!!!,5

"Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower, Blue","The tip about taping half the air output port works somewhat, but that's no excuse for this thing being really poor to begin with. Additional problems include a *screwed-in* battery compartment, incredible noisiness, and very high likelihood that your child will get his finger pinched/mangled when they inevitably shove their hand into the cute penguin's rotating death mouth.",2
"Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green","This holds all the doodads from the Dr. Brown's bottles, and I don't mind having it sit out since it's attractive. I don't have any pooling water or mold or anything, but the two pieces can pop into the dishwasher anytime.",5
Disney Babies Mickey Mouse &amp; Minnie Mouse Fleece Blanket,Super cute item! It's not easy finding baby Mickey items ! This is perfect ! Looks identical to the picture! The baby M & M are really cute & the picture shows the true color :),5
Medela Single Deluxe Battery/Electric Breastpump,"My sister in law gave this to me for my first child after she used it to help nurse her two sons. After helping me with my first and second child, I now gave it to my other sister in law. For a first time mother,nervous about nursing she was able to pump 3 oz her first day home with the newborn (1st time to ever use a pump) and 6 oz her next time she needed to use it. I was happy to help her out with such a realiable product at such a delicate time. To think that pump is 6 years old!!!!!",5
"The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup, Disney Princess",The beauty of The FIrst Years Sippy cups is they do not have a valve but instead rely on a small rubberized hole on top of the lid to regulate the flow. No valve to lose or go bad. Much easier to wash and sanitize. I could not be happier,5
Summer Infant Deluxe PiddlePad,"I take long car trips every month and have found this pad to be a lifesaver! On occasion, my 2 year old son will spill his juice or wet through his diaper. All I have to do at that point is change my son, take the pad off the seat, and put another pad on the seat. Much easier than dealing with a wet seat! I have 4 pads total, 2 for each car seat, for my two sons. These pads hold the liquid or wetness in them, and allow the carseat to stay completely dry. When I get home, I wash the soiled pad in the washer and let it drip dry. So easy! Well worth the purchase!",5
"Mommys Helper Juice Box Buddies Holder for Juice Bags and Boxes, Colors May Vary",This product works great for my 20 month old. Fits almost all juice boxes. Easy to clean. This is perfect for toddlers who have just started drinking juice boxes!,5
Infantino Light and Sound Ball Musical Toy,NOt good toy NOt good toy NOt good toy NOt good toySound and sensors are not working well together it didnt  hold my boys attention at any age!!! Waste of money !,1
"Dr. Sears Nibble Tray, Yellow/Green, 12 Months",Best product I've bought in a while. Very well thought out and visually appealing. Love that you can freeze the dip section to keep it cold. The covers are awesome and seal well. I've had it over a week and used it every day. My son loves it too.,5
The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Mosaic Marble - Certified Baltic Amber &amp; Resin Baby Teething Necklace - w/The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),So pretty.  I lost my toddlers previous amber necklace.  I do think they work most of the time.  She loves her new necklace.,5
Cloud B Tranquil Turtle - Aqua,"Item was as described. Love it! Shipment was pretty fast too. Was expecting a little bit sooner, but can't complain too much. Great Product!",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog",I love the design and it's the right size for kids going to day care or starting kindy. You can write your child's name inside in a designated area which is good to prevent your kid's belongings getting lost.,5
"Bibimals Baby Bibs (Safari Pack) Button Latch Better for Long Hair - Funny Cool Cute 2 Pack of Bibs with Food Catcher Pocket Made From Waterproof Washable Silicone Plastic, Best for Use with Girl or Boy Infants and Babies - Your Baby Will Love These Silly Animal Face Bibs, Great Baby Shower Gift, Lifetime Guarantee - [Add These Bibs to Your Baby Registry Today]",Awesome product. Easy to use and clean. Baby loves it! No issues so far. The button could be a little easier to close and open.,5
"Nuby Nibbler Food Vegetable, Colors May Vary",This is such a great idea and big help in allowing our daughter to feed herself and get more food in her tummy than on her clothes. We cut up bananas and our daughter held on to the nibbler like a spoon and sucked out most of the food. Looking forward to trying other foods. The downside is that it is a huge pain to clean so I might go and get two more so that I can alternate and use the dishwasher. I would have given it more stars if it had been easier to clean.,4
"Playtex Drop-Ins Pre-Sterilized Soft Bottle Liners, 8-10 oz. 100 ea","I have used the older version of the drop-ins, where you have to fold them over the top of the bottle, and they leaked. I have also used the version of drop-ins that do not expand. Well needless to say this version is their best yet. They don't leak and they hold enough liquid without spilling over the top of the bottle.",5
Hallmark 2012 Keepsake Ornaments QXD1601 Winnie The Pooh Baby's First Christmas,I found the perfect ornament for my grandson. I forgot to pick up one from 2012 and I found this one. It was perfect! My daughter-in-law loved it too!,5
"Graco Sweet Snuggle Infant Soothing Swing, Jacqueline","My daughter is 9 weeks old and purchasing a swing was essential! When it arrived we were very pleased. It is very pretty and easy to assemble. Once our baby arrived we found it to be a lifesaver! She absolutely loved it and it rocked her to sleep in no time while I was doing other things. We love that you can change the position of the seat, as the side to side motion didn't seem to please her after about a week, but the back and forth is very soothing to her. The other day however, we noticed that even though it was on the number 2 setting (which it had always been on) it was swinging very fast, as if it was on the number 6 setting! So, we put it down to the 1 setting and that would be fine for awhile, but would slow down to almost stopping and then speed back up to a 6 for a few seconds and then slow back down. Now it is doing half swings and then stopping completely. The motor is blown. Very disappointed that after such a short amount of time we are having to either replace the motor or the entire swing. I would not recommend this product to anyone. Too much of a hassle for any new mom to deal with.",3
Playtex Sip Ease Replacement Valve - 2 Pk,"Not only did they arrive quickly, but there was no trouble with fit. It is great to be able to just replace the valves and not throw away the entire cup.",5
"Bumbo Seat Play Tray, Ivory","Simple installation yet when done correctly it will not simply ""pop off"" as some suggest. Its sturdy, simple design does what you'd expect it to do.Really can't ask for more for a product that costs less than $10. I'd buy another if one wasn't enough.",5
Graco RoomFor2 Stand &amp; Ride Stroller - Lotus,"So happy with the stroller.  This stroller is so lightweight and collapses to smaller than my travel system Graco stroller.  My kids are thrilled that they each have their own seat and cup holder!  Really easy to set-up and collapse.  The only downside is that when collapsed, the fabric touches the ground/floor...but it is the underside so it's not too big of a deal.  The pop of red on the black looks great too!  I think it is a wonderful value and will work out just perfect for our trip to Disney and any subsequent trips to the zoo, park, or just going to walks.  This is the sit and strand stroller to buy!!!!",5
"Summer Infant ComfortMe Wearable Blanket, Happy Floral, Large",This wearable blanket is great.  It is really well thought out and well made.  It is comfortable for the baby and easy for the parents.  I have no complaints.,5
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Bouncer, My Little Snugabunny","I purchased this when my son was very young and it was one of the first baby holder type items I got. My favorite thing about it is how snugly my son would sit in it when he was a new born.  It's almost like a rock n play  in its snugness with the newborn insert, and without it as well as your baby grows. My baby is not amused by the vibration or the music though, but every baby is different. I purchased this before I really knew what a bouncer was, so understand that if you want it to bounce your baby needs to wiggle around a lot or you can bounce it yourself by hand.  My son didn't even notice the birds really until almost here months old and when it soon came time to want to grab them they are always out of his reach which both of us find annoying.  I'm not sure why the toy bar is so high. At four months he still can't reach them, so I guess they aren't meant to be grabbed or batted at by baby.",3
The First Years Clean Air Filter Replacement 2 pk,I don't know why I even bother to purchase this product. My diaper genie still smells bad whether I put new filter in or not.,1
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,I actually got the Snug Tub Deluxe.  This version comes with inflatable rings that baby can stack on the inflatable post.  It also has an attached inflatable fish that wheezes when you squeeze it.  I used it for the first time tonight and my 6 month old baby enjoyed the freedom to splash and play.  My only caution is to use something to keep baby from slipping.  I put her baby sponge underneath her to elevate her and propr her up.  This was also good to lean her back to wash her hair and to keep her from slipping.  I'm glad I bought this instead of the EuroBath.,5
Infantino Compact 2-in-1 Shopping Cart Cover,"I recieved this as a gift at one of my baby showers. I thought it was going to be great, but it is a big old mess. There are way to many folds and pockets, took me 5 minutes just to get it onto the cart. And the folds into a handy compact. Yea right, I'm not sure a genius could fold this thing back up into the little carrying case it claims to fold into. It is very cute, but not very user friendly.",2
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe WrapSack Blanket, Sketchy Sport, Large","I just don't have any use for the zipper functionality of this blanket.  I never left the baby swaddled up and unzipped the bottom to change a diaper.  The zipper doesn't detract from the design it just doesn't add to it at all.  The material is very soft and cozy, and the swaddle straps are just so cozy and wonderful!  My baby loves to be all snuggled up in it and I swear it helps him sleep longer and better.",4
The First Years Disney Pixar Cars  Rev and Go Potty System,"Natalie is already using the potty and loving it She learns very fast, she takes after her grandmother. Better not tell the grandpa.",5
Baby Jogger Adjustable Belly Bar,"I bought this bar for our double City Mini and our twin boys love it! I bought it when they were 10 months old and right away they loved pulling themselves forward on it so they could look around and see each other better. I read one review that said this added width to the stroller, which would have been an issue for me since its a double, but the bar did not make the stroller any wider. I am very happy with the purchase!",5
"Nautica Kids Drew Mini Twin Set, Blue/White","Picture looks much better than the actual product.  The quality of this comforter was disappointing for the price (colors, pattern, and overall appearance). It looks like a cheap ""bed-in-a-bag"" set in person.  Not only the appearance is cheap, but also the feel of the material.  I expected a smooth, soft cotton but it is stiffer and more uncomfortable-feeling than I anticipated.  With the poor quality, I don't think a run through the washing machine will even help.  In fact, I'd be worried about this thing falling apart if I tried to wash it, which really stinks since I'm sure most people (like myself) are buying this for a child's room.I expected much better from Nautica.  My husband agrees that the online picture of this quilt does not compare with the quilt in person.  So, that makes two of us. Sorry to disappoint those of you who saw the picture and fell in love like my son and I did, but I wouldn't waste your money or time like I am now doing by packaging this thing back up and sending it back for a refund.",1
"JJ Cole Collections System Diaper Bag, Black Damask","Very sturdy bag and gender-neutral (read: my husband will carry it).Problems:- So many pockets actually make it hold less: trying to carry one child's things including some bottles and a change of clothes, maybe a toy, and it is too full for the diaper to zip- It claims to have an insulated section but it is really an insulated pocket on the side for a bottle but the top is open...so not really insulated- Front flap just for show.  Pretty useless for organization",3
"Luvable Friends 6-Pack Flannel Receiving Blankets, Blue",These blankets are really small! However they are really nice to have around when spit up happens. I would rather have these than a burp cloth any day!,3
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Mini Bassinet, Natural","This thing was a beast. Very heavy and clumsy. I could see using it as a non-travel bassinet. It is difficult to collapse, fit in the perfectly sized bag, and on top of that, it is really heavy, like 30 pounds heavy. There is another review that is similar to this one.",2
"Britax Adapter Strap Kit, Black","Attached easily to the combi twin sport. I will use it with my Chicco keyfit carseat which fits snuggly in the combi.  Great option for a little extra security. Did not come with any type of instructions, and took me a minute to figure out how to attach it. I did not open the metal loops, but instead slipped the one end through the loop making a loop around the bar of the stroller ( if that makes sense)  Overall, for the price it was exactly what I was looking for to add some extra security in holding together a non-matching carseat and stroller.",4
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,"The suction cup does not suction and within an hour of hanging, it would fall off. Usually after the little one would go to sleep and make a loud BANG in the tub. I returned it. Haven't found anything better yet.",1
"Philips AVENT Comfort Breast Shell Set, 2-Pack","This is one of the best breastfeeding products I have ever tried. Especially usefull for the first few weeks. They keep clothing off of sensitive nipples, which makes things much more comfortable. They also allowed me to collect several ounces of breastmilk at each feeding to freeze for later. that liquid gold would have gone to waste otherwise!! I have told all of my pregnant friends to get them and will be recommending them to everyone who will listen. more than worth the money!",5
Performance Carrier Color: Charcoal Black,"my favorite carrier of all time. We also have an original carrier, which we use for our infant, and this one is for our 19 month old! Using it all over the world.",5
Lamaze My First Purse Baby Toy,This was a gift for my granddaughter and she loved it.  We enjoyed watching her play with it. Kid friendly and well made.,5
"OsoCozy 6 Pack Prefolds Unbleached Cloth Diapers, Size 1","I've had the same set of OsoCozy prefolds for a year.  Each diaper has been used and washed at least once a day-- usually more often-- and still not so much as a frayed corner on any of them.  Very absorbent, and they only seem to get softer with washing.  Superb prefolds.  Be aware that these are much too large for newborns, though.  I have the OsoCozy Indian Cotton newborn size 4x6x4 which were perfect for the first months.  The quality of the smaller size is equally excellent, and they remain useful as extra diaper padding or diaper cloths into toddler-hood.  Couldn't recommend more highly!",5
"Dena Happi Tree Hamper, Pink",This hamper does exactly what it is supposed to do. It holds dirty clothes in a very stylish way. Matches our baby's room with the adorable owls. I love the removable mesh liner inside so I can just grab it and go to the laundry room. I would definitely recommend this product!,5
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"Bought this product based on all of the positive reviews and it's a life saver.  We used it everywhere.  Great toilet seat minimizer and very sturdy portable potty.  Makes traveling with a little one so much easier but helpful for being out and about too.  I don't buy the special bags, just use the regular grocery bags.",5
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink",The only swaddle my baby can't break out of! I bought this for my 10 week old who was breaking out of swaddles within minutes of putting him down! I wasn't really sure how this worked but it basically uses baby's own weight to keep his arms cozy and comfy. I would definitely recommend this to parents whose babies break out of swaddles easily but need to be swaddled to fall asleep- and stay asleep!Another nice side effect is my baby seems to associate being all wrapped up in this with sleep and is falling asleep much quicker and with a lot less fuss!,5
DaVinci Alpha Mini Rocking Crib - Natural,"Great simple design - much better than the bulky full size cribs which are often tacky. Great for small spaces, I am so happy with my purchase.",4
"Nuby Paci Cradle Pacifier Box, Colors may vary","It's fairly straightforward and simple, which is what we like about it.  It can hold 2 (maybe 3 if they're small and flexible) pacifiers.  The hanging portion of the holder has a 'split-ring' design so that it easy to hook onto our stroller or any other loop.It's made of stiff plastic, which actually works out well for us.  Because it keeps it shape, it has less of a chance of getting lost in the diaper bag.  Rather than using Ziploc bags, which always seemed a little 'eh' this works well.  It's also easy to stay organized--a pacifier in the case is clean, everything else is assumed to be dirty.",5
"Waterproof Pull On Pants Potty Scotty/PottyPatty, Large","these are great waterproof pants for potty training. they are soft and hold up in repeated washes. they do run big, really big. buying a size down will spare you some leaks.",4
"Leachco Easy Teether XL Side Crib Rail Cover, 2 Pack, Brown",My daughter actually eats the wood on her crib! This stops her and it matches her crib perfectly. Love it!,5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Jumperoo,,5
*The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* - Mixed Colors - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace - w/The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN THE USA),I haven't noticed too much difference when using the necklace vs. when not using it.  It's cute and I am able to knot it once then wrap it twice around baby's ankle.  If I don't see any improvement in the next few weeks I will take it off my son and put it on my ankle to see if it helps relieve any of my own aches and pains.,3
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White","After washing, the mattress cover seems too short and is difficult to put on, especially length-wise.  I wouldn't order it again.",3
"Zebra Baby Blanket in Faux Fur with Black Satin Ruffle and Ultra Lux Plush White Swirl on Back, An Alexander Timothy Designer Baby Throw",I love it! It is a smaller blanket but I knew that when I bought it. Very nice and so soft. I would recommend it to anyone.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I purchased this as a gift for a shower.  My friend loved it and looks forward to using it.  It shipped fast too.,5
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Light up &amp; Go Turtle Soother,I use this light on my nightstand every night for the overnight feedings.  It has enough light and it's easy to just push the turtle.  My son really likes watching the turtle in his bassinet too.  It holds his attention for as long as it runs.  It's a good product!  My only complaint is that I wish the light stayed on longer-no big deal though.,4
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet, Celery","I bought a couple of these for my DaVinci Emily mini crib.  They fit over both the 3"" thick mattress I got as well as the mattress pad that came with the crib (not sure if it's in the listing, but these sheets fit up to 5"" mattresses).  They're pretty thin, but they get the job done.",4
Diaper Dekor Plus 2-Pack Refill Biodegradable,"I purchased the biodegradable version of the dekor refill bags without realizing it. After days of wondering why our daughter's room suddenly always smelled of poo, we realized these bags do not block odors at all. Besides, are the disposable diapers biodegradable? I don't think so. If you're really concerned with being environmentally sensitive, I suggest going with reusable diapers. Otherwise, stick with the non-biodegradable diaper pail bags!",1
Aqueduck Faucet Handle Extender,"WIth a new baby, this is a lifesaver!  My son can do all his pottying duty's on his own without me running in to turn the faucet on for him.",5
All Star Sports Wall Decal Stickers by Sweet Jojo Designs - Set of 4 Sheets,The item worked well and was easy to apply. It made my twin boys nursery look great.  I am satisfied with this product.,5
"Green Eats Divided Tray, Blue","Nice size, soft edges, simple functional.  One fatal flaw, despite being labeled in the plastic on the bottom, and on the box as dishwasher safe, it melted and warped with it's first washing. This tray is NOT dishwasher safe. They melt. Luckily, it did not catch fire.",1
Medela Freestyle Breast Pump,"Lets just say that Steve Jobs was not in the same country as the design team for this pump. It is awful, which I can say after 7 months of use.  I can't believe we spent this much money on a pump that barely does the job, and is so finicky that using it is a constant headache. The battery frequently loses contact with any jostling or bump, which means that the unit has to be plugged in CONTINUOUSLY for 24 hours.  So, while it was sitting on my desk at work and the back cover came slightly lose for no clear reason, the battery wiggled, and I had to drive home for 20 minutes, interrupting the 24hour recharging cycle, so it was useless the next day without being plugged in.  This happens about every month.The ""hands free"" system is absurd.  Really?  3 different straps that attach to a bra?  Do you think I wear the same bra every day?8 separate parts to wash after every pump session???louddoesn't suck very wellthe clip on the back doesn't hang on to anything, because it's too small and is embedded within plastic so it takes 3 hands to attach it to anything, except perhaps the ""included belt"" - like 1950's Modess.  really?  I can't just clip it on to my PANTS?  Oh, right, I guess I'm supposed to be wearing a dress...The buttons are slightly raised nubs, and because I can't clip it on to anything, I end up holding it, and invariably pushing some button about every minute or so.I hate this pump. I hate Madela for making such an awful, poorly designed pump that they charged me a humongous amount of money for.  I want it back.",1
"Sassy On the Go Feeding Set, Blue","I bought this at some point when my son was a baby and now that he is in kindergarten I'm still using it! I find that I use the smaller containers for things like ketchup, raisins, etc. and don't usually put them in the larger container which I use for things like sandwiches, spaghetti, or chicken fingers. I like that I can fit this AND a water bottle into my sons lunch box where some of the other containers are too large for both. Also, these are bpa free! Not sure why they aren't advertising as such but that was one of the main reasons I picked this up.[...]",4
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I have also read great reviews about the diaper dekor while I was pregnant and decided to get it, but it is terrible, whenever I put a diaper in there and the lid opens up the smell of poop comes out and into the room, we coulnt take it anymore the fact that the nursery smelled like poop most of the time even though I changed the bag way before it was time to. Now I take the poopy diaper, put it in a plastic bag and throw it in the kitcken garbage which we take out almost twice a day.  I would not recommend this product",1
Munchkin Jelly Bean Cargo Sling,"My sister bought this years ago before it was recalled and let me use it with my son who is now almost 4 months.  I have been using it [barely] for about 3 months now, only because it's all I have.  Even since my son was itty bitty [7 lbs at 1 month when I started using it] it was SOO uncomfortable!  I just put him in it today and he is about 13 lbs and I took it off after literally 30 seconds.  It kills my neck and back and there is no comfortable way to wear it.  Then as I was researching if there was another carrying position I could try, I found out it was recalled for safety issues.  Worst carrier ever!  Don't buy this-put your money towards something more comfortable and safe!",1
Summer Infant 3 Piece Dr. Mom Oral Care Set,"These little set is absolutely the most perfect gateway into teeth-brushing on the planet. Okay, I may be mildly exaggerating, but it really is wonderful! You can tell the company spent some time and money researching the 3 best items to include in a starter set. The squishy finger &#34;cap&#34; is great - my daughter (15 mos) loves to chew on it with a little tooth gel. The brush and gum massager (our least favorite item) have big handles that are easy to maneuver for parents.New moms: if this isn't on your registry, add it. And, if you're looking for a practical gift for a new mom, you must get this! It's an essential that a lot of new moms don't think about right away. It's one of those things that's great to have on hand once the toofies start coming in! :)",5
"LA Baby 3&quot; Compact Crib Mattress, White","The mattress my crib came with is better described as a pad (and barely that).  This mattress is plush, without being too soft, and works perfectly for the new baby.  It is also the perfect thickness for the sheets to fit correctly.",5
Tommee Tippee Travel Bottle and Food Warmer,This is perfect for us on the go. We boil water before we go and it is enough for two warming jobs while out. Easily refillable at a gas station coffee pot with hot water. Water stays same temp well over 12 hours. The plastic cover is perfect size for our wide bottles. Definitely worth it!,5
"Thirsties 3 Pack Boys Fab Doublers Soft Cotton Velour, Ocean Blue/Meadow/White, Large","Buy these! The price is a steal for the quality, softness, and incredible absorption you get!After a much disappointing absorption performance of Joey's Bunz Babykicks Hemp Premium Inserts (3-pack in the large - I gave it a ONE star review! If you were considering those, get the Thirsties Hemp Inserts 2-pack Large instead! - Click and see my review -Thirsties Hemp Inserts 2 Pack, Large 18-40 lbs), and pretty much coming to the conclusion that I had paid $21 dollars for a set of Babykicks hemp inserts with the absorptive abilities of a couple sheets of paper towel, I decided to use these (Thirsties 3-pack Girls Doublers) whenever using those awful Babykicks Joeys-Bunz inserts.Eureka! Talk about doublers that are SUPER SOFT and aptly called THIRSTY! They gobble up loads of wetness to keep the little one cozy and dry. I cannot emphasize enough just how soft the cotton velour on these are! Think of the softest fleece you have felt, then you will begin to get the idea BUT SOFTER! They are very durable as well, and you can tell straight out the box, they went the extra mile to ensure top construction. Personally, after trying out several various brands of inserts, doublers, and liners, if I could do it all over again, I would have purchased these thirsties doublers (for overnight use) or for super-extended no change periods these (inside diaper next to baby's skin -thin fleece liner recommended option to serve bm's barrier) and a Thirsties Hemp InsertThirsties Hemp Inserts 2 Pack, Large 18-40 lbs.As for my 3 Babykicks Joey's Bunz Hemp premium inserts, I am tempted to throw them out because they are utterly useless. They aren't soft enough to place directly next to baby's delicate skin so cannot be used as a liner, and with such limited absorbency (a kitchen sponge absorbs more liquid) that they are useless as a ""doubler"" or any use where soaking up liquid is a must.If i were not as green as I am, these would already be in the trash. Perhaps I can donate them to a seamstress and have them recycled into something of use.Okay, back to the Thirsties 3-pack Doublers! I cannot say enough positive things! Really, get these and do not let the low price trick you! These should be selling for over $15/$20 based on performance alone! They are softer, better constructed and more absorptive than products costing 3 times as much.",5
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"These are nice because my baby lunges for the food hardcore and could conceivably impale himself on a metal spoon. Also nice to have so many as he invariably grabs the spoon and chews on it, finally throwing it to the floor.",5
Tiny Love My Nature Pals Mobile,We needed a mobile for our son's crib at daycare.This one has a bunch of great reviews so we decided to go with it.The mobile works perfectly and I would recommend to anyone looking for a versatile mobile!,5

"Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry Diaper Bag, Black","So far this bag is working excellently for our cloth diapers and we have had it for three months.  Holds moisture/ small amounts of liquids in as well as keeping smells contained. The only suggestion to the design team is to make a larger/stronger zipper pull as this one seems very fragile and I'm afraid I will overuse it.  The small zipper pull also makes it difficult to open at times.  With my postpartum finger numbness, grasping a tiny zipper is tedious.*When washing pull inner liner out of fabric bag so nothing fills with water. I dry for a few minutes in the dryer to help the fabric along and hang for the remainder.",4
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","I got this because so many people raved about them but my son does not really like being in it. I started putting him in it around 10 months after using the baby Bjorn. While it is more comfortable for me, it can be hard to get him in and out. He also doesn't like sitting so low. He is much happier in a backpack carrier where his head is up near mine.",3
Soho Butterflies Garden Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"I'm very worried because i have just buy this set and i 've seen several comments (BAD) about it.i will return back to you my comments when i get it in my hands, in a few days.Soho please, send me a high quality bedding set!!PLEASE!! i 'm worried",3

"Hoppop Bato Bath Tub, Lime","I wish they would have thought about slippery bottom And include rubber mat with order, it's expensive enough to have it. Other than that, after I bought green sprout baby bath mat and 5 pack tiny bath mats, she is enjoying her bath time and we do 2. Also the hole for draining leaves some water inside which could lead to mold, I wish it was thought a bit thorough. But I still love it, looks great, feels great.",4

"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Polypropylene Bottle, Opaque, 4 Ounce, 2 Pack","My son and I love these bottles, they are our bottles of choice. I like the shape, design, everything. They also have less pieces (less pieces to lose) than some other bottles that I have, so that's a plus.",5
Keekaroo Comfort Cushion Set - Cherry,"I purchased these cushions at the same time as I ordered the highchair thinking they'd be necessary. However, the chair got here 2 weeks before the cushions and my son was fine with the pad that came with it. When they finally got here I was a little disappointed with the material. I was under the impression that it was going to be made with a faux suede like material, but it was more like the bumbo seat polyurethane stuff. It's easy to clean still so I kinda got over it.So I did struggle a bit with initially putting the cushions on. I had to take the crotch bar thing off to get the bottom pad to fit, then I had to lengthen the rear seat belt straps a lot(which was actually very hard to do), since there weren't any holes for them to go through in the cushion. The back pad was hard to get in at first, but I can easily handle it now, when my son manages to wiggle enough to get it off.Another thing that bothers me that is an ongoing issue is that the bottom cushion comes out almost every day. If my baby boy is not too excited to eat for some reason he is easily able to kick the cushion out from under himself as I'm putting him in, which is a little annoying. On the other hand if he's having a great time and bopping around in it the cushion slides out again.However, I decided to keep the cushions, since they do add nice cushion for times when I need to do chores that are going to take a while and he has no problem at all sitting there for even 45 minutes with them. He even likes to put his arm up on the flap that comes out from the back pad and rest his head and watch me sometimes.. :)",3
Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"Light and easy to put on the table or take off with one hand. small enough to fit in the diaper bag and sturdy enough to hold my 2 year old. Be careful, it does not fit all tables. We have run across problems with tables that have a lip, and sometimes tables in restaurants are just too thick. But this has been only a few times. Prepare for a lot of comments! Everyone walking by your table will say how cool they think it is and what a great idea.We purchased this item in 2004 and are still using it, now for our second child. I have purchased one for 3 of my other friends who eat out a lot. Keeps baby right up at the table with you.",5
"Woombie Air Ventilated Baby Swaddle ~ Choose Size/Color (Big Baby 14-19 lbs, Love Print)","The product is overall pretty good, but the mesh has two drawbacks.1. It's weak enough that it started to get &#34;runs&#34; on the first or second use. I'm afraid to use it and risk getting a hole.2. If your baby is active within the swaddle, the mesh could potentially cause a rug-burn type effect on their fingers.",3
Carry You Piccolo Small Stroller Snack Tray,I liked the caddy and found it to be good quality and a good price. I would recommend it. I used it on the front bar of our stroller for my son to store his hot wheels and sippy cup.,4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"My son it doing well with this seat, no little potty, staight to this seat.  The lip could be a little higher as sometimes he sprays over.  Fits on the toliet really snug",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Infant Starter Gift Set,EXCELLENT......!!!!!!!!!,5
KidCo GoPod Portable Activity Seat - Pistachio,"If you get out of the house at all, you should get this! Unless you just want to hold your baby in you lap while he grabs at your food and everything else you have within reaching distance!It was easy to use. I had no problem setting it up or taking it down. A friend saw me trying to figure out how to raise it (without reading the directions, haha) and showed me how, even though he had never seen one before. So I'd say most people should have no problem, especially if they read the directions.",5
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,"Just to describe this a little better, it comes with seven toys to hang from the bars: a duck, a cardinal containing a bell perched on a ring with beads, a sunshine with dangling rattle, an apple teething toy filled with water so you can freeze it if you want, two plastic discs with photos of a puppy and a duckling, a mirror, and a star that plays music and lights up.  It comes with extra links so you can add some of your own toys, too, and there are hanging loops at the top, middle, and bottom of the bars.  The mat itself is brightly colored, has a satiny sort of finish, and is nicely padded and breathable.Issues:The mirror itself is plastic-y and curved a bit so the reflection is a bit distorted.  Doesn't seem to bother her in the least.The star's lights were a little frenetic for her with certain songs at first, but she loved it by 10 weeks old.The mat's fabric shows drool stains, but that doesn't bother me personally.The upshot:We love this toy.  Our daughter started with it when she was about 7 weeks old and was immediately delighted with it.  In the ensuing weeks we found that she would be interested in different parts of it at different times, but at 10 weeks she would happily lay under it for 30 minutes at a time... or more.  We rotate the hanging toys through and always take one with us when we go out.  In short, this is the one indispensable toy we own and I'd recommend it highly.",5
Baby Einstein Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym,Everyone I gave it to said it was the best baby gift.,5
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","Beautiful stroller, can't wait to see the little one in it!  It will be used so much, and with the carseat too!",5
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary","This seat fits almost every toilet, the grip handles allow your toddler to feel safe while jumping on and off the seat.  The deodorizing is not a big deal, as you would prefer to wash the seat from time to time instead of buying the re-fills.Overall is a great seat.  Highly recommended.",5
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx","The seat is Purple, not blue as appears in picture.  If you live in the south, this color choice is good bc it does NOT have the hot velour padding and material.  This one is the cool, smooth/sleek material.",5
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss Toddler Flatware, 16 Piece",I've had these for about 3 months now and they have held up really well. They're a good size. My daughter isn't feeding herself yet so I don't know how they will be with that but they seem like they would do well with scooping.,4
"Carters Velour Playard Fitted Sheet, Ecru","I purchased this sheet after being unable to find a mattress pad for my pac 'n play at a price I was willing to pay. This velour sheet is a good alternative, as it is thick enough to provide some cushioning over the hard pad in the pack 'n play. The Carter's velour sheet will work fine for my occasional use when I have a visiting grandchild. I wish it were available in other colors, as the sage is a pukey green, but, hey, I can live with a yucky color as long as the sheet functions as it should.",4
Fisher Price Soothe N Play Bouncer - Woodland Animals,My husband and I love this bouncer and so does our daughter. The colors work well with our modern decor and the toys are plastic (not fabric) so they don't get grimey and gross. They are also easy to clean when it's time.  She kicks and it really bounces - which she loves. The owl and mushroom are really appealing and so are the ways that the other animals flip around the bar. The bar itself can be removed easily but also acts as a handle for quick maneuvering.  So worth the cost.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"We have had our Jumaparoo over a year now, it survived my son and a move. Now my daughter plays in it everyday!!!! Very durable!!! My nephew loves it as well!! I would recommend this to everyone! I have had no problems, it's safe, comfortable and really keeps the kids entertained. My daughter hates the walker but loves this!!! BUY IT",5
"Dora The Explorer Faucet Cover, Blue","States it fits ""most"" tub spouts, unfortunately it doesn't fit ours. Dora's head is also kinda wobbly, looks like it would fall off after much use.",1
Infantino Animal Park Shape Sorter,"While this doesn't talk or flash lights like some of the other shape sorter toys, she does really like to play with this one. It is easy for her to carry, which she wants to do with everything, and doesn't have too many pieces that it drives me crazy to find them all. Only complaint: the doors to the barn come off and I have to put them back on. It isn't a safety issue, but it is a tad bit annoying. However it is an enjoyable toy for her regardless.",4
Pumpin Pal Hands Free Strap,This took a very long time to set this up right for it to finally work. And when I had it working I was afraid to move at all because it felt like it would fall off. I wish I would have ordered the one with the bra attached to it instead. I would have returned it if I had kept the packaging and stuff it came with. I was too optimistic. Waste of money.,1
"Munchkin Swaddle Angel , Boy, Circle Print","After having tried 4 different kinds of swaddles, the Munchkin Swaddle has a few pros and cons for our newborn son.  Its light-weight fabric is great for warm weather climates, but it still needed to be hung up to dry after going through a tumble-dry low cycle.  I love being able to change his diaper without unswaddling his arms.  The large zipper and pull seem a little big and unnecessary, but compared to the Halo Sleep Sack, the diaper is more accessible without all the heavy fabric getting in the way.I was excited to try a swaddle that had pockets for the arms, but I had a hard time pulling the fabric tight enough so that my son's arm were secured.  He was able to pull his fist up to his mouth and suck on it through the material.  My husband was able to criss-cross his arms so that both fists were not near his mouth, but I don't like that he's sucking on the extra fabric still.  As with the SwaddleMe, there is too much material near the mouth even with his arms secured.  The Halo Sleep Sack has a better tapered cut so this doesn't happen.The Velcro pads need to be larger, especially on the right side.  We are not able to pull the left side as tightly as we would like.  The pad on the tummy doesn't allow the fabric to lay nicely when he is swaddled and there's a gap where the two fabrics meet.  You can see his clothes underneath and we have to keep tucking the fabric in. The angel wings decoration on the back is a really cute touch.  For the cost of this product, I would not buy it or recommend it.",3
Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,"I really love my new pregnancy pillow. I am finally able to sleep comfortably through most of the night,minus the bathroom trips. It takes the pressure off my back and hips. I would recommend this product to all pregnant women.",5
Playmobil 5719 Nativity Set,"My son is 2 and loves this set. We took all the small parts away until later. I love that we can teach the true meaning of Christmas through play, and as usual the Playmobil piece are so detailed and durable. The scence itself is just cardboard.My only suggestion would me to make that plastic too and just charge more. This would be perfect for any child during the holidays. All the basics are there, the holy family, the wisemen,the manager, some animals, etc.",5
Evenflo ExerSaucer Triple Fun - Jungle,Love this ExerSaucer.  The only slight challenge is that the alligator is a litlle advanced for my daughter at 15 months.,4
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",My baby loves this. I keep it in the freezer for him so that when he is teething he can chew it and have the cool against his gums. It helps a lot,5
Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,our daughter uses it.  Nice and sturdy.  Not too soft.  She sleeps soundly through the night on it.  10 times better than the old one we had.,5
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado","I've been using this pail liner for almost two years, in rotation with another liner (by Rumparooz), and though the fabric is still holding up, the sewing job on this thing is a joke. It's super simple, just a piece of fabric folded in two and stitched up each side with elastic on top. It's so simple, in fact, that any visit to a fabric store and five minutes with a sewing machine will yield the same result for less money. I've mended it a few times where it has opened. So, it's okay, but costly for what it is. The other pail liner I use was a few dollars more but it's very sturdy and the design is much better.",3
"Stork Craft Venetian 4-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, Cherry",This crib is absolutely beautiful. Even more so in person! The wood is of high quality and the machining and finish are top notch. VERY solid. Highly recommended!,5
"Stork Craft Portofino 4-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib and Changer, Espresso","I know how hard it is to decide to purchase something as important as a crib online which is why I am compelled to write a review, knowing I read hundreds of them in the process and they all helped me greatly. This crib is a great buy and I'm glad we took the chance on purchasing it online. The price was reasonable and economical. The structure and color of the crib is very nice - visually stunning. The 3 drawers are spacious and we were able to get all clothes in there, divided by sizes. The 3 back shelves are great for storage for things you don't need to reach for every day - such as storage for spare diapers and wipes. It's hard to reach back there so I wouldn't recommend placing items you need every day. Overall we are very pleased with this purchase and would recommend.",5
Kick Mats - Deluxe Car Seat Back Protectors 2 Pack - Keep Your Car Seats 100% Clean From All The Stains And Scuffmarks Left By The Kids With These Auto-Protective Seat Covers - Designed For Most Vehicles - Protect Your Investment - Lifetime Guarantee,"So far the mats are working perfectly.  I had some issues with other protective mats and the way they attached to the bottom of the seat, but these elastic bands seem to be the right solution.",5
"Clip'n Go Stroller Hook, Green by PBnJ baby","I have ordered 4 of these over the past few years.  They are fantastic when traveling with children and renting double strollers - like in Disney World!  I just clip them on the handles and can hang our shopping bags, coats, backpacks, anything!  Easy to open/close.I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 because 2 of them have broke during use.  I do ask a lot of them, so I wasn't terribly upset, but the hinge could be a bit more durable.  So...get more than one! :)",4
Maclaren Volo Stroller,"Well, after reading great reviews on this stroller, I bought one, but I had to spend a great deal of time finding one volo of dark color, seat and hood especially, since when folded the hood touches the wheels.I have a few friends that got the volo on the white hood colors and they just get dirty and filty nasty, I don't have time to wash a stroller.  I don't know what the designing people of Maclaren where thinking when choosing such light colors, other than that the stroller works perfect and it is very light. So I ended up buying the brown coffee color from Baby Universe, not the coffee stripe, it is different.",2
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink",I bought two of these for my twin daughters to use at lunch - I pack everyday for them to ensure they get a quality lunch and like to send hot lunches and these work great. Keeps their lunch hot and yummy 5 hours from the time I put it in the thermos and it is easy for them to open (which was a problem with the older ones they had) + the wide opening makes it easy for them to access the food. Very pleased with this purchase - thanks Amazon!,5
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Dee Dee the Dragon",Dee Dee is adorable. I love her and my daughter does too! I have the princess and the moose too. All are equally adorable but each are a little different so it's fun to change them up. Easy to take with us and to play with at home. I would highly recommend the dragon!,5
"Mud Pie Baby Little Princess Sip N Munch, Crown","I love this product!  It is just beautiful and a perfect idea!  I wish there were more choices in colors and designs.  My only qualm is the straw is way too short at the top, my 7-8 month old loved it by now as she is 10 months old... it is just a little too short to take into her mouth and she tends to get frustrated at first.  If they made one with a larger straw I'd buy it for my 3 year old who would truely benefit from the little munch cup at the bottom.",4
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"While I have asked questions pertinent to making this cup work in our house, I find myself more often than not wanting to throw it against a wall as it leaks incessantly, and pretty much are guaranteed instantaneously to start leaking as soon as the lid is on, it leaks form all sides as there doesnt appear to be a proper seal on the screw top and out of the straw. I have tried all the tips and tricks and with zero success on bettering this cup. However I have in fact come across a cup called ""Simba"" same straw technology better price point and that DOESN't spill or leak from anywhere there straw and screw top lid are designed slightly different and with that comes a wonderful user friendly cup that i have nothign but positive things to say about :-) So for all of you who find frustrations with this cup please look at ordering a SIMBA, its great!!",2
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"Love this monitor! After much research before our little one was born we decided on this monitor because of price and simplicity! I can't say enough about their customer service! Our camera just quit one day and we contacted the company and had a new one sent to us within a couple days! Recently I dropped the handheld monitor and the antennae broke. I didn't give it much thought because it still worked. After about a week with no antennae it stopped working. I simply emailed the company and they sent me a whole new set before they even recieved my defective one! They are quick to respond and very knowledgeable! The monitor itself works great..I love the night vision and love being able to watch my little one as she sleeps! Highly recommend!  One downfall in my book...I do wish the monitor had constant sound, the sound cuts in and out only when the baby makes a noise. Totally fine but, I like to hear everything!",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub Deluxe,Our 6-month-old loves the tub!  It is convenient for us and saves water.  Right now he stays occupied with the build-in squeaky toy while we wash him clean.  It fits nicely and seems to be pretty sturdy and well made.,5
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,"Milkies Milk saver is a great product for all nursing mothers. I only purchase one because it's pretty pricey. I place it on one side of my breast when I breastfeed the other side. I can't believe how much milk I've been wasted during feeding. I put the milk that was collected in the bottle and feed my baby later. It's easy to clean and store away in its storage(also included). The only down side is a little too big to wear it outdoor. The size of it is very noticeable. Other than that, it's a wonderful product. I also purchase this milkies milk saver for my friend as a baby shower gift. She loves it. I highly recommend this item to all the nursing mothers.",4
"OXO Tot Baby Food Freezer Tray, White/Green","I only spent about two days looking for a baby food freezer tray, but when I got the discount email for baby items at Amazon I wasn't expecting to find the perfect freezer tray. And I did! It keeps the food well, good size, food pops out easily and I love the fact I can pop out one or two little cubes and put the remaining back in the freezer. Cleans nicely and while I only have one, I like the fact it would stack well if I bought multiples. We have a small freezer.",4
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","Pretty simple to assemble, I love that it has as nice toy tray.My son didn't really start to like this product till about 6 months of age, he can sit in it for a good 20 minutes and be easily entertained with the different toys.I really like this product, its a bit different from all of the other bouncers,swings, and infant activity items out there.UPDATE:My son is now 9mo and still uses this seat, it does manage to amuse him, however now he is more interested in reaching his feet under the front of the tray.Its also very convenient to take to grandma's house or to put my kiddo in it, in the kitchen while I get something done.",5
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","I am so crazy about the Ergo Baby. It is so comfortable and easy to use, not to mention extremely well made and customize-able.The straps around the hips and shoulders are well padded and distribute the baby's weight perfectly.I use it for both my three year daughter and my 4 month old son. My 4 month old can ride all day in it and never gets fussy. He naps comfortably, and can breast feed discreetly, thanks to the button-up hood in the front.There is a world of difference in the quality and construction of this product versus other baby carriers on the market. Where some feel flimsy and unsafe to hold even a newborn, I feel confident and secure even hauling around my toddler in it.I would highly recommend this product to any parent who has children up to 5 years of age.",5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Healthy Care Booster,"We owned an earlier model of this booster seat. I bought it about 5 years ago. It took us through 2 children. The model we had came with two removable trays. When the top tray got messy, we removed it and continued with the second tray.Because we had a high chair, it was not used constantly. It was easy to take places that didn't have high chairs such as when we visited with relatives who did not have children. You can take it on picnics or to restaurants. A few times I put it on the porch while the older child played with bubbles. The chair made the experience worry free. The children were not left alone, but it was easier to play with both children instead of having to constantly watch/pull the little back from the edge of the porch.When I gave it away recently, the plastic still looked good. To clean the straps which I could not remove, I used Shout towelette wipes. It looked almost new.I liked the colors on the older version better. The back was red with a blue seat. The trays were green and yellow.I highly recommend this booster chair.  It is light yet sturdy.  It is easy to clean and use.",5
"Booginhead Pacigrip, Nautical Red",These are a must have and more than one. I bought the red and blue ones. Infatuated with nautical right now so they match all of my son's outfits,4
"OXO Tot Tub Drain Stopper, Blue",The product itself is good. Decent price but the only problem for me is how it fits. If your drain has a nob that sticks up above the seal part it will not work. Otherwise great product for seal stopper.,3

Tiny Love Musical Take Along Arch - Ocean,"This is the only thing my son will coo and smile at on his carseat!  It hooked just fine to my infant seat.  The musical crab plays music when you shake it.  Even going over a bump in the road will activate it.  When it plays, my son will smile at it.  I love this toy.  It makes riding in the car enjoyable.",5
Mobi Glomate Junior,We love this product.  My toddler uses it for bed time and it is so wonderful.  After 15 minutes it shuts off so no worries about making sure to turn it off.  Highly reccommended.,5
"Tiny Love Tummy Time Fun Activity Mat, Frog","Pros:- nice, vibrant colour- pillow is good size for wedging baby in sitting position as alternate use- mirror is good (image is not distorted like some other toy mirror), and my baby loves to chew the mirrorCons:- unlike those gym with activity cross bars, this is just a tummy mat, and nothing more, so I think it wasn't a smart purchase- the mat is quite small so it's no longer in use after a couple months- after a few washes the mat is a bit wrinkled, it wasn't too bad, but not as flat as new- pillow material is not as smooth and soft as I'd like it to be",3
Baby Crawling Knee Pad Toddler Elbow Pads Pink,It looks nice but it's too tight for my baby girl. They should make it in diferent sizes to fit all kinds of babies.,1
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","We used to have one of the star-projecting ladybugs in the room with our little kids, but the batteries would die relatively quickly. This plug-in projector has been great. The kids love the three different projection slides you can put in, and the choice of music and adjustability in time and sound level work well. This is a great choice for the nursery -- you won't regret it.",5
Sassy MyPhone,"I like that this makes sounds when you press the different colorful buttons. Perfect for an infants developmental skills. But the sound is way to low. We am hardly hear it, unless the room is silent.",3
Lotus Travel Crib and Portable Baby Playard,"I so wanted to love this travel crib, but I just can't. After copious amount of research I purchased the Lotus (at the hefty $200 price point) for a trip to visit family alone with my 8-month-old that involved flying. This thing seemed like the perfect solution since it was compact enough to fit in an overhead storage bin. The compact size is the ONLY thing I ended up liking about it. Below are my major disappointments and reasons I am selling it after about 4 months of use:- velcro straps take forever to thread through the base to secure the mattress and sheet (all while hunched over at a very uncomfortable angle since you have to have one arm in and one are out of the crib to do it).- the mattress DOES NOT LIE FLAT once the sheet is over it. It pulls the mattress to a point that baby has to lie on it (uncomfortably I'm sure) to flatten it out, and even then it still pulls up on the ends. I have no idea how they got it to lie flat with the sheet on it in the product picture. Mine will not do this.I find myself envious of my friends' bulkier pack 'n plays because they are SOOO much easier to assemble and take apart and their babies look so much more comfortable in them. For the $200 price tag, the lotus should have a more efficient assembly and the mattress should lie flat!!",2
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Loves to play with the buttons and lightit comes on automatically if it hears a soundand it can be set to turn off in 15, 30, or and hour intervals.it will Not run Forever... The first one we had brokeand this one is now starting to fail.  But it's worth the $$for a good nights sleep.",3

"Hudson Baby Striped Chenille Blanket, Pink","This blanket is extremely soft not too big when he carry's it doesn't drag he is about average 21month old but when he goes to cuddle up and lay down covers pretty much his body, blanket tag says 30x40 its the first thing he grabs at night to go to sleep and when he wants to nurse. nice material so far no problems and he is in love and I get my sleep back,",5
"NUK Gerber Graduates Baby Food Pouch Feeding Straw, 6 Months Plus, 2-Count",My son plays with all his packets and it just ends up in a mess and waste of money.  This prevents him from squirting it everywhere and he actually eats them now.  YAY!,4
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,We installed this perfectly as instructed and it came off within a day. I wanted it to work so bad I didn't listen to all the other reviewers...baaaaad!,1
"Lamaze Developmental Toy, Flip Flop Fred",Or I should that my grandaughter loves it. The only gripe that I have is that product dimensions on your web are incorrect. The toy is listed as being  24 x 10 x 6 inches. Its real size is 4.5 dia. x 2 inches high.  I'm still looking for the big box.,5
"Wupzey Highchair Seat Cover, Orange Dot","I bought this on a whim for my expensive Chicco highchair b/c buying a replacement pad directly from their corporate office was too much of a headache.  I LOVE IT!!  Easy to slip over the current cover, washable, cute to look at...what else can you ask for!!  Great purchase!!",5
Peg Perego Uno Travel System,"The stroller is a snap. It has all the features of the top end strollers for a fraction of the price. A bonus is that you can move the handle bar from one side to the other, which is great to use it as a pram and then later for when your child is older. The car seat is an easy install; the only downside is it is a little heavy, but by the time that that is an issue you will be leaving the car seat in the car anyways. It is also very aesthetically pleasing.",5
"Safety 1st OnSide Air Protect Convertible Car Seat, Adeline Black","Comfortable chair, easy to strap baby in. A little difficult to adjust the straps to make them higherEasy to install chair into chair",3
"Fridababy The Windi Gas and Colic Relief,  10-Count","I was at my wits end and ordered this, not really even in my right mind. I thought it was funny and I needed some comic relief. It is life changing. Happy baby, happy life.",5
ERGObaby Organic Sucking Pad Pair,I would recommend this sucking pads.  My son kept on sucking on the straps and I had to wash the carrier all the time.  I started using the sucking pads and now I only have to wash the pads...i still wash the carrier but not every time I use it.  The picture is a little different from the product as my sucking pads came with 3 snaps instead of velcro.,5
"Delta Canton 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Dark Cherry","The crib is beautiful, but we bought it to match my daughter's dark cherry crib purchased Target 2 years ago.  The crib that we were sent is a walnut color (no hint of red at all).  There were also a couple small areas where the finish was chipped off (side rails near where it meets the back rail).  The box was in good shape when it arrived though so I do not think it was a problem with the packaging/shipping. We will end up keeping it though.  Also Delta made a couple of improvements to the crib that don't match our other crib.  The mattress support is  a metal frame with springs which seems better than the metal rods our daughter's mattress rests on.  Also when we do convert it to a toddler bed there will just be one side piece slightly longer than the one on our old crib (also an improvement).",4
"Peg Perego Convertible Infant to Toddler Car Seat, Black","We purchased this seat after reading tons of reviews and doing a bunch of research.  It was super easy to install. Our daughter is 1 year old, 21 lbs and 30 inches tall.  She just out grew the Peg Perego Infant seat.  The car seat is in a Landrover LR4, which has a short backseat, this seat fits in it with enough room so that I, as the driver, still have room to put my seat back.She seems just as comfortable in this seat as in the last Perego.  The wings allow her to see out the window while rear facing and still keep her safe.",5
"Chicco Smart Support Backpack, Red","I love the backpack and even my child loves to be in it, which is amazing.  Very good support and easy to use.",5
Graco Jump N Jive Doorway Jumper with Interactive Musical Mat,"Really well made, excellent back support, lots of safety features.  Not all babies like to kick and jump, but if yours does, this Doorway Jumper is a guaranteed winner.  Just be sure your doorway is really oversized, because with enough energy and jumping, you don't want to take a chance of it bumping into the door frame.  The mat is kind of fun.....different sounds when the baby jumps on different areas.  The song might drive YOU crazy, but our 6 month old never seems to get tired of it.  A word of caution.....this is really well made, but the leg holes are kind of large.  Just be sure not to let the little one be in this without supervision...",5
Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress,"I started researching PNP Mattresses after my sons's two month check up and he was already 11 lbs. I read so many reviews and was hesitant to make ANY purchase!Everyone kept commenting that the mattress was too hard and not comfortable, but I had to get something. I finally chose the Dream on Me 3&#34; Foam Graco Pack 'n Play Mattress and I couldn't be happier.It is NOT hard at all. It is has the right amount of give, but is solid enough to not worry about him at night. It also fit perfectly in the Graco Pasadena Pack N Play Link Here (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Y9AKZI/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc;=1)I have an organic fitted sheet on it that also fits great.It doesn't have the plastic/fake feeling that other baby/toddler mattresses have either. I'm very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone that is using a PNP as a crib.",4
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink","My son was so excited when he got this. He's only 1 1/2 years old but loves to sit and climb on it. The rocking part of it is kind of lame though. Due to the chair being so lightweight, if you choose to put the rockers on the bottom the chair will slide around pretty easily making it difficult (And dangerous) for your little one to climb on it.",5
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black","My wife an I have the B Nimble Britax stroller and it folds up fine when the strollers folded for storage or to throw in the back of the suv for shopping ventures.  Velcro straps hold it onto the metal handles by the handle bars and it has yet to come off, been on it for 8 months or so without issues.  The magnetic center part is nice for keys and small items, not galaxy S4s but small HTC cellphones fit it.  Cup holders are regular sized fit can and cups but not big gulps lol.  Does what its supposed to do, works and looks nice.",5
"Arm's Reach Concepts Mini Convertible Arc Co-Sleeper Bedside Bassinet, Cocoa/Natural","OK, let's talk about the good things about this co-sleeper:--it is relatively cute--built to allow you close access to your sleeping baby.On the other hand:--it was hard to put together (and this is after a veritable parade of baby assembly projects, including multiple things from IKEA and a pram and a dresser).  the directions could have been a lot clearer.--the warning labels are printed on the bed directly, and say the word DEATH over and over.  i am not super superstitious, but neither am i thrilled to have the word DEATH written seven times on my newborn's new bed.--it is too low to the ground (unless you have some really low-lying bed, like a futon maybe).  so you have to buy ""leg extenders,"" which arm's reach would like to sell you for $18~, and theirs look really flimsy and unsafe.  i bought extenders from a different company.--the ""mattress"" inside it is hard as a rock and has lumps and grooves in it.  arm's reach would like to sell you an organic mattress replacement for $119.99.  i bought a pad for the mattress (B008VVWP8A, costs $99) only to discover that my new mattress covered up the co-sleeper's two inches of mesh, which are there at the base of the bed to keep your baby from suffocating once they can roll over.i guess i am going to use the co-sleeper with the latex pad until the baby can roll over, and then i'll have to figure out a new solution.  but i am pretty emphatically dissatisfied.  i feel like i bought a car only to discover that the seats and the steering wheel had to be ordered extra.  this $175 cosleeper might be more like a $315 cosleeper once all is said and done.",2
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,I love this pillow.  It provides exactly the right support and I sleep comfortably through the night.  I wish I knew about this when I was pregnant with my first child.,5
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Extra Tall Walk-Thru, Bronze",We have had this gate up for 8 months to keep the animals out of our new living room & it works great.  I love that it can easily be taken down if needed to clean or have more space to get through entry way.  I am going to order another one for our office.  It has held up great & we get compliments on how nice it is & blends in instead of looking like a gate.  Have had several people ask where we purchased it.,5
"Summer Infant Slumber Buddies, Frog",It's adorable and I love it I've owned it for about a month and I'm in my third set of batteries. I regret buying this. Seriously.,1
Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack,I've been very pleased with this drying rack.  I received this as a gift when my first daughter was born in 2010.  It's been on my counter ever since.  We are long past the bottle stage but it still works well for the sippy cups and kids silverware. It has held up nicely.  It would make a nice shower gift for a new mom.,5
"Eric Carle Back Seat Baby View Mirror, Elephant","I love the Eric Carle theme so of course I wanted the car seat mirror!  The elephant is adorable and the straps that attach this to the back of the seat are well made and there are no issues at all with it falling or with poor placement.My issues with this product is that the mirror isn't any good. First it comes with a sticker on it that if you don't get lucky removing leaves a film that is impossible to get off. Second, the mirror just isn't that good, it's difficult to see in because it has a distortion. I consider it to be a driving hazard because it will cause you to keep your eyes off the road for too long in order to see what your baby is doing.If you need to see your baby, and I know that sometimes we do.. then I advise you to get a better mirror or simply pull over and assess your child's needs. No good will come out of getting into an accident because you're focused on trying to see into a mirror that isn't really a mirror.",2
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","One half of the internal mechanism that opens/closes when you step on the pedal broke - the plastic pivot point sheared off under regular use.  We weren't rough with it - it's just cheaply constructed and didn't last.I'm planning to buy a regular step trash can instead, which will be more reliable, and use regular garbage bags.",1
Summer Infant 3-Stage Super Seat,Got this for my 4 month old daughter. It was easy to put together. It did smell like plastic when I opened it but the smell went away after a day. I like that the tray is so big because I can put other toys on it for her without them falling on the ground.,4
"Kids Preferred Lion King Plush Toy, Nala","I used this as part of center pieces for my daughter's baby shower - great plush quality.  A little on the pricey side, but the quality was good; i got what i paid for; that's for sure.",5
"Thirsties Duo Wrap, Honeydew, Size Two (18-40 lbs)","I've been using it on my baby since it was three weeks old and with the use of the snaps it fits just right. Baby is now almost two months and it still works great. The gussets on the legs are great at preventing leaks, pee or poop, have not had any problems. Highly recommend.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Rainforest",Our grandson loves this highchair. He keeps busy with the toys while his Momma cooks supper and he can watch her also. It doesnt take up as much space as a full sized high chair. They love it.,5
My Little Pony Drink Bottle,I bought this for my daughter but decided to keep it.  Does this make me a bad father?  Don't judge me.,5
"Summer Infant Sleek and Secure Multiview Handheld Color Video Monitor, Grey","I had purchased and returned several different monitors before this one because each one had a flaw I couldn't live with.  This was the first monitor I could find that had the capacity for muliple cameras and didn't automatically go into the ""sleep"" mode (essentially turning off until it hears a loud sound. I hated that!)  I like the autoscan mode that goes between cameras every few seconds the best.  The sounds stays on the entire time and is very sensitive.  This is exactly what I wanted as I like to hear my children breathing.  The color and picture quality is not the best, but that's okay with me... I can still see the kids just fine.  Also, the screen is a little small, so when it splits into 4 boxes for the multi-view mode, the boxes are only about an inch in size.  And maybe my husband and I just can't figure it out, but the sound seems to turn off in multi-view mode too.  So there is a little room for improvement, but overall, I am extremely happy with this product and would definately recommend it to anyone who wants to use multiple cameras with their video monitor.",4
"Graco Sweet Slumber Sound Machine, White","Bought this to help my 6 month old stop frequently waking whenever hearing the dogs barking, noise at night to get her to take longer naps and eventually sleep through the night. Well, she doesn't sleep through the night, but her naps went from 45 mins to an hour and a half! The dogs barking at the UPS man doesn't wake her up anymore. I can vacuum around the house when she sleeps, do dishes and carrying on a normal level of sound. Prior to this machine, I could not do that. We use the white noise for sleeping and play the music when she plays in her crib. Sound quality is nice. I haven't tried the Mp3 cable yet. I also like the night light for at night when I go in to soothe her I don't have to turn any lights on, just tap the top of the sound machine.",5
"Dappi Waterproof 100% Nylon Diaper Pants, 2 Pack, White, Small","I am using these diaper pants as underwear covers and they work great. My daughter recently started potty training and the covers have kept in 100% of the mess with the few accidents that she has had. Having to clean up less of a mess and protecting our furniture at the same time has been great! The only reason I didn't give this product five stars is because the leg holes are a bit too small, but we have made them work.",4
"Gerber First Essential Clear View BPA Free Plastic Nurser With Latex Nipple, 9 Ounce, Single Pack",I always like to stock up on bottles for my granddaughter so i purchased a few of these great bottles for the price.,5
"Luvable Friends 5-in-1 Soft Baby Carrier, Black, 3-18 Months",this carrier is the best you'll ever find with all it's different positions u can carry ur baby most carriers only carry your baby front or back this carrier has a side carry position which is wonderful because with my other carrier i had my baby face outwards in my front but he would still be in the way with this carrier i had my baby sideways like i was carrying him in my arms but HANDS FREE... LOVE THIS PRODUCT ALOT,5
Oxo Tot Bath Toy Bin,"I live in an older home with some strange textured walls and surfaces around the bathtub, we attempted to attach this to the smoothest surface we could find but it just didn't hold. There was no replacement adhesive so we got creative and attached it to the same wall with command strips and it has stayed put for over a week  now. I use this for the small bath toys that my toddler has in the bathroom, since this allows the water to drain off I think it is much better than the bucket we were using previously.",4
Blueberry Deluxe Laundry Bag Tote,"It is cute and I really like the strap.  I just wish it was a little bigger.  It says 8 diapers, I disagree.  I can only put a max of 6 diapers in it.  Otherwise than that I have had no problems with it. Holds smell well and makes cloth diapering on the go much easier.  I've been using it for over a month now.",4
New Pink Minky Dot Chenille Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,Comforter set is cheaply made with thin fabrics.  The added extras are thrown in to make it appear that you're getting more for your money than you actually are.  I returned the set and was charged a 15% restocking fee.,2
Bamboobino Baby Washcloths / Wipes - 5-pack,Not as nice as I was expecting.  Will know more after baby momma washes and uses them. Maybe she can comment on them.,3
Bright Starts Petal Pusher Carrier Toy Bar,when my baby isn't sleeping in the car she loves playing with her toys. I am glad I got it for her.,5
Baby Home Emotion Stroller - Blue,I am so glad that I got this stroller. It was very easy to assemble and the directions were really easy to follow. It's lightweight and folds up for easy portability and storage. It rolls very smoothly which some other strollers I tested did not roll near as smoothly as this. It comes in a variety of colors and priced just right. It almost fully reclines which is great. It comes with a pretty large sunshade/waterproof canopy so your baby doesn't get burned and the sun isn't in their face. It has a pretty large shopping basket (larger than others that I looked at) to put diaper bag and pocket book in. It includes a rain cover and mosquito net which most other companies will make you purchase these seperately. I had looked at a lot of different strollers before turning to this one. For the price you cannot beat it.,5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count",would love to be able to give 0 stars. These are horrible. They leak really easily. I also bought the Charlie Banana and as the saying goes you get what you pay for. I love the Charlie Banana. They cost a little more but are well worth the money.,1
"Label Itz Bandette Cup and Bottle Labels, Zoo Animals","I thought these would be wonderful for daycare, where we are required to have our son's name and date on every bottle.  The packaging said that with a pen, information is easy to &#34;erase&#34;.  I did not find that to be the case.  After using them once, the date will not come off.  I tried to write his name over it, but it doesn't look great.  If I had known, I would have just put his name and been done with it, but I now have 6 of these and it drives me nuts that I can still see the date from March!",3
Ken Health - Mini Medicator - Baby Medicine Dispenser/Pacifier with Free Syringe,"Our infant loves this, and we frequently use it for gripe water dispensing.  We ordered a second one just to have another handy, but the seller Good Life Products shipped a different, inferior model.  Going through their exchange process now.",5
"Itzy Ritzy Wrap &amp; Roll Infant Carrier Arm Pad &amp; Tummy Time Mat, Social Circle Blue",I love this wrap for my car seat! I have unrolled it and used the mat for my baby as well. I would definitely buy this as a gift for friends when they have babies.,5
"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Taila",I am pleased with this car seat except for 1 issue...The arm rests do not go high enough for older children. They have two settings and even on the highest setting the seat belt is hard to get under the armrest and over my daughters legs. Other than that it is easy to take the back rest off and adjustable for head height.,4
"The First Years On-The-Go Booster Seat, Safari","We bought this a couple of years ago to use for travel, but we ended up using it daily for over a year.Pros: compact, easy to set up, comfortable, inexpensiveCons: When used daily it's difficult to clean out crumbs and food that's become caught in the velcro and the material folds. For this reason, we recently bought a hard plastic booster, but we'll still use this for trips.",4
"Munchkin 4 Pack Mighty Grip Flip Straw Cups, 10 Ounce",These cups are ok.  The straw design is funny and makes deep cleaning difficult.  Getting the straw back in after removal for cleaning is a puzzle.  They work reasonably well and don't spill much.  They do tend to splash liquid out when you open the straw with liquid in the bottle.,3
"BayB Brand Bean Bag for Babies - Filled, Ready to Use - Ships in 24 Hours! (Blue/Blue)",Just received this bean bag a few days ago and my 1-year-old seems to enjoy it. He's comfortable and secure!,5

"Personalized My Quiet Book, Fabric Activity Book for Children By Pockets of Learning",Excellent customer service! They were very helpful. The book itself is very cute. A couple things were sewn on crocked bit it's a great gift for a little one,4
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","This toy is awesome!It attaches to almost anything!  I love the versatility.  We have attached it to a swing, a carseat, a highchair, a bouncer, a changing table...its really neat.My baby is fairly young to &#34;play&#34; with the toys, so I can't rate those yet, but once he gets a little bigger I see him enjoying this even more.Innovative toy, worth the $",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","so far this cot is perfect, it is for my granddaughter to use while holiday company is using her room.  it arrived quickly, and is more than a fair price for it's instant setup and sturdy base.  my 5 yr old granddaughter can set it up and fold it down to slide into it's storage case in the mornings all by herself.",5
bumGenius One-Size Snap Closure Cloth Diaper 4.0 - Bubble,"We have been using these diapers since our son was born.  He is now nearly 2 years old and they still fit him as well as they always have.  Initially, the diaper is a bit bulky because the fabric bunches with all of the snaps, but as your child grows the diaper becomes less bulky.  When we decided to cloth diaper, I was aware that they aren't typically the slimmest of options, so a little extra bulk didn't bother me.The inserts are absorbent and I like that you can double up for nights and nap time to help avoid leaks.I love all of the colors available!I certainly recommend the snap closure over the velco.  We had a few velco one sizers and the velco wore out after a year.  Our snaps are in great shape and I look forward to being able to use them for baby #2 someday.",5
"Gro-Egg Color Changing Digital Room Thermometer, White","The gro egg was a spontaneous purchase - so it was sort of gamble on our end to get it. We've spent the last couple of weeks adjusting to a cooler temperature in our apartment!  I actually really like it - you know if the temp is right by the color of the egg and it makes a nice nightlight too. Also, we weren't aware that the room temp needs to be at a much lower temperature for baby - so it's nice a visual cue to make sure baby's room (and really our apt) is on target. We have another digital thermometer in another room close by and the temps are in sync. I would give this egg 5 stars if they had the time on their too. With that said, I'd recommend this product to others.",4
"JJ Cole Swag Diaper Bag, Bronze Drop","I love this bag because it doesn't look too much like a diaper bag. Only the size of it gives it away. I really like the design, it fits everything I need. My little one likes pulling things out of the outside pockets so it keeps him occupied. And the outside zippered pocket is big enough for me to put just about everything from my purse in (and the little one can't get in it.) It had one flaw on the gold part(in the fabric)of it but you dont really notice it. Overall I think its a fabulous diaper bag.",4
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"This is a great little music player. It has an off switch (always important), a low volume and a louder volume. The music is all instrumental with no strange or annoying voices singing.  The classical music is all upbeat and my 16 month old loves it. He dances to any music--even commercials and TV programs.  He loves being able to carry this around.",5
"FuzziBunz Perfect Size Cloth Diaper, Cotton Candy, Large 25-40+ lbs","I have a seven year old still in diapers at night...for many reasons. With the cost of it all I wondered how cloth would be and I am happy to report that these diapers are wonderful. The weight requirements say up to 40 lb., (he is 60 lbs.) but my son is thin, so I was took a gamble, and they work great! And so much cheaper. I am grateful for this bigger cloth diaper.",5
One Dozen (12) Rubber Duckie Ducky Duck Christmas Nativity Scene,"This nativity scene is exactly what I expected--absolutely darling, whimsical and perfect for the collector.  The price was right too.",5
Babies R Us Washcloth - 8 Pack (White),"I am usually a 100% cotton, organic if possible Mum.  However my husband bought these cloths for bath time not realising they had 20% polyester in them.  I didn't like them at first but have since changed my mind.  I like to use a fresh cloth ever time I wash and bath my son. We go through maybe 5 a day, sticky faces and hands. This means I need a lot of cloths.  They have turned out to be a great size, big enough for me to wash him with and small enough for him to deal with. He now likes to have a go at washing himself and are easy for him to hold onto and squeeze some of the excess water out of.  A normal sized flannel is just too much material for them to handle.  They are soft on his skin, wash fab on a hot wash and tumble dry great.  They are nice and cheap so it doesn't break then bank to have a whole heap of them.  So far I have't had to throw any out because of fraying etc and they have been in use for about a year.  Very pleased with them 5 Star!!!!",5
Multi-Purpose Lock - Clear/Silver 6 Pack,"This product is great for securing refrigerator doors, and other appliances or doors. It fastens easily and withstands strong toddler hands trying to pry it open. It is a bit difficult to close, but I like that I can leave it open if I choose to and don't have to wrestle within every time a cabinet, or door closes.",4
"Sealy Sweet Pea 2-in-1 Maternity and Nursing Pillow, Cappuccino","I bought this pillow when I was 4 months pregnant hoping it would provide support. I would wake up with severe round ligament pain within 30 mins due to the lack of support and being unable to position it. I still decided not to return it as I thought that maybe I had bought the pillow too early since the woman in the picture looks farther along in her pregnancy. I am now 8 months pregnant (with a huge belly!) and I pulled the pillow out again last night to use and woke up again with the same round ligament pain due to lack of support. I have tried to ""mount"" and position this thing in every way possible and can't get comfortable. I am 5'4 and yet this pillow is also no where long enough for me to get the hip support as showed in this picture.Every other pillow in my house provides more support than this one does. My only hope is that I can use it for breast feeding but if it's too hard for me, I can only imagine how uncomfortable it will be for a newborn. Maybe mine was defective because the picture shows that the pillow is more narrow at one end (by the head). If I look at mine.... it's the same width at both sides.I should have returned it months ago. :-(",1
"Baby Crib Mirror - Black, White &amp; Red- Infant-Stim",Useful for my baby - big and not breakable which is a major plus :) I like the ties.. can tie them to various things...but my baby seems to  be losing interest in looking at herself in the mirror now,4
Baby Home Emotion Stroller - Blue,"I love love love this stroller, let me count the ways:1. Super light weight for a fully featured stroller!2. REALLY compact fold, heck it fits into my scion xb trunk which is how I found this stroller in the first place. Saves me such precious cargo space.3. Stylish - it is one of a kind!4. SUPER easy fold but requires two hands.5. HUGE storage basket that you can actually use.6. Adjustable footrest and the back EASILY reclines.7. Smooth ride with ONE hand. Yes, I could not believe it. Those skateboarding wheels are the trick.8. Comfy - she loves it and that's huge!9. Magnetic peakaboo window!10. Ships with mosquito net and rain cover!The ways that I could love thee more:1. Seat folds outwards so I always have the wheels of my stroller facing out in my car so it doesn't get the seat dirty.2. Canopy not huge but you can buy an extender or an attachable umbrella that can basically follow the sun and give coverage at any angle.3. No cupholder included (cmon!!!) but you can buy one as an accessory.I also own a first ignite umbrella stroller (too long for my XB. I have to get everything out before i can use it). We also own an orbit stroller that I love but once again takes out too much space in this car's trunk, so we leave it in the other car. Another huge downside of the orbit is that you have to remove the seat before you can close the stroller. So yes, good question, where do you put the seat while you fold the stroller?? Lastly, we have a hand-me-down BOB revolution that is fantastic when we go on the trailer but when that beast gets into our trunk, nothing else does. So it pretty much stays in the garage. Babyhome emotion is my everyday stroller.",5
"Dr. Brown's PreVent Design Pacifier, Girls, Stage 2,  6-12 Months",Really love these. They came in a timely manner and i like how the nipple has the hollowed out portion.  It may make it easier to get rid of her pacifiers.,5
Evenflo ExerSaucer Mega - Farmyard,"Evenflo ExerSaucer Mega - FarmyardThe paint on the sheep and pig toys immediately began chipping off as soon as I bought this item.  Of course, my son puts both toys in his mouth, so he ended up eating the paint.  I had to take both toys off the exersaucer, and replace them with different ones.",2
Fisher-Price Sounds 'n Lights Dual Receiver Monitor,"This is a great monitor.  I am able to keep one receiver plugged in on my night stand and the other receiver is plugged in on the ground floor of my house, with batteries so I can take it around with me.  Having two receivers means never having to look for it before going to bed - one is always there!The range is great I've been able to hear my daughter clearly outside at my mailbox (about 50 yrds away).  The batteries last a really long time, and even when they are low the audio works long after the lights fade from lack of power so you can still know what is going on while looking for replacements.I've never had any ""bleed over"" from phones or other monitors in the neighborhood.  One problem I've had is during the summer I pick up a sports radio broadcast, but if I just turn the volume down a litle I can't hear the broadcast but I can still clearly hear my daughter.This monitor has worked great for 2 years and I'm hoping to buy a second set for the new baby so my toddler can still have a monitor in her room.",4
"Stork Craft Tuscany Glider and Ottoman, Cherry/Beige","***EDITED AGAIN 5/14/12***And now the chair is kaput. I was rocking my now-almost-2-year-old as part of our bedtime routine and suddenly there was a crashing/cracking noise and we dropped an inch or two. I figured one of the bolts had fallen out (it's happened before) but one of the bearings had been ripped away from the chair, leaving damage to the wood. It might be fixable, but honestly, I'm sick of replacing screws and bolts when they fall out and constantly tightening and WD-40ing this thing to keep it in working order. I really wanted this chair to be a good cheaper alternative to a more expensive rocker and it just didn't work out. :( Probably going to put it out to the curb tomorrow and go buy a recliner. So disappointed to be tossing the chair I've been rocking my little one to sleep in every night for the better part of two years!***EDITED 10/3/11****Well, we've had the glider for the better part of a year now, and sadly, it has not held up. It is now squeaking constantly no matter how much we tighten and WD-40. We still rock our 14-month-old nightly as part of our bedtime routine, and it's now annoying and feels kind of rickety. Unfortunately, the quality has just not stood the test of time. I'm really sorry to say that, because I wanted to love this chair and it is very comfortable to sit in. Our Shermag, which also gets daily use, works as well as it did the day we got it. If anything, I think the rocking motion has gotten smoother on it over time. I mentioned in the original review that I thought the Shermag would outlast the Stork Craft, but I didn't think the SC would poop out THIS soon! The SC would be a great rocker for grandma's house, but if you plan on rocking for more than a few months, this one is a waste of money, sorry to say. You're better off investing in a good one up front.*****We already have a $300 Shermag rocker that we use in our nursery, and we got the Stork Craft Tuscany Glider/Ottoman when we wanted a 2nd chair but had less of a budget. Here are the main differences:--- The Shermag is noticeably ""plusher"". The cushions are much, much softer. The Stork Craft has a pretty crunchy foam seat that needed to be broken in (not a lengthy process -- I kneeled on the cushion a few times before putting it on the seat). If, like me, you appreciate a firm cushion, you won't think this is a problem. Both chairs are attractive, and the quality of the Stork Craft fabric is nicer than I expected for the price point.--- The Shermag is heavier and sturdier. I would be surprised if it didn't outlast the Stork Craft. (Hey, you get what you pay for!)--- The Stork Craft was MUCH easier to assemble. Many fewer steps as the ottoman and bottom part of the chair (the glider) were fully assembled in box. My only complaint re: the assembly is that a hole was not drilled where it should have been to connect the left arm of the chair to the base. Each arm attaches in three places, and I found it to be sturdy enough without the third bolt that I didn't bother returning it. Next time my dad is over, I'll have him bring his drill and fix it for me ... no biggie. In the meantime, the arm doesn't wiggle with regular use.--- Yes, the Stork Craft squeaks. It squeaks loudly enough to render it completely unusable. My dog actually came running in from the other room the first time I used it and started barking at the chair because she thought it was an animal, ha! The squeaking comes from the bolts on the glider part of the chair. I sprayed some WD-40 on the joints, and voila! No squeaking. If anything, I would say the gliding motion is now smoother than my Shermag.--- The seats are different sizes. Once you have all the cushions and padding on, the Stork Craft seat is 18 inches across at the armrests and 17 inches deep, vs. the Shermag's 20 inches across and 20 inches deep. The back of the seat is longer on the Stork Craft -- 28 inches vs. 26. I am short and slightly overweight (5'4 with a long torso/short legs, size 14) and the Stork Craft fits me much better. However, I am sure the Shermag would be much more comfortable for a tall/long-legged woman, an average man, or someone more heavyset.--- The Shermag has a lever to lock the chair in place, which I need on that chair to stand up smoothly while holding a sleeping baby since I have to scoot forward before I can touch the floor. The Stork Craft doesn't have the locking mechanism, and I thought I would miss it; but since the seat actually fits my legs, I have no problem getting in and out of the chair gracefully. (And believe me, that's a feat!)Overall, yes, the quality is obviously nicer on a more expensive chair. But the only dealbreaker for me was the squeaking, and it was an easy, $5 fix. If you are petite and looking for a nice, inexpensive rocker, this will definitely suit your needs! If you are tall/heavyset, you will definitely need to invest in a different chair.",1
dreamgenii Pregnancy Body Support and Feeding Pillow (UPDATED),"This pillow is great because it provides just the right amount of support without taking up the whole bed. I sleep on it different ways depending on how I am feeling - sometimes I use the back support for my belly and pull the bottom part of the other side up through my legs. I also flip it over when I change sides, which is easy to do. It has completely stopped all of the hip pain I was feeling sleeping on my side. I would definitely recommend this pillow, even for those who are not pregnant but need support!",5
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",I bought this for my toy poodle because she runs all over the backyard when she's supposed to be taking care of her business. This play yard along with treats has totally house trained her. And I know she is safe.,5
"Safari Evergreen Jungle Tree Wall Decals, Jungle Stickers with Green Leaves and Vinyl Tree","Love these decals!! These are heavy duty-type decals and they look really nice on the wall. The whole set is very large, so make sure you have enough wall space. I got the teal colored set for my baby boy's room, and it's nicely colored, however, a little feminine looking-but that's probably my fault for choosing teal. I omitted putting the flowers and butterflies on the wall that came with the mini teal-colored animal set that I purchased too, that was definitely too girly. I didn't have many problems applying the decals, but I can now recommend to overlap the decals a little when attaching the branches to the trunk. I tried to fit mine on without overlapping, just perfectly next to each other, and the next day there were small spaces of wall I could see in between, and I had to remove the trunk part and redo. But everything re-stuck, and it looks great!!",5
Eco Sprout Bottom Balm+ (2oz),"My friend from Texas told me to try it, though I couldn't find it in any stores in my Washington State neighborhood.  I've used gdiaper cloth diapers for a year now and I was just using coconut oil on my little girl but I wanted something more protective.  I saw that this could be used with cloth diapers and it was all natural so I thought I would give it a try.  I love the smell and it seems to keep my girls bottom free of rash so far, I think I've been using it a couple months.",5
"Gund Baby Magical Wand Sound Toy, Pink, 9&quot;","So far, my 1 year old daughter likes this wand...but it's driving me up the wall! It only has one 'magical sound' that plays over and over, and it plays every time you pick it up, shake it, step on it, etc. Needless to say, hearing the same little sound over and over can grate even on the most patient of mothers' nerves. I'm giving it three stars because my baby girl likes it, and it is super cute, but mom and dad need ear plugs!",3
"Skip Hop Moby Bath Kneeler, Blue",cute and feels good on knees you do not notice how good this feels on your knees till after you use it.  Didn't notice that kneeling but the tube was hurtning my knees but you notice the difference after using this,5
"Leachco Wrap Strap Anywhere Safety Strap, Red","Love this! it works wonderfully on shopping carts, keeps my son from sliding all over the place. I love that it is wider than traditional cart seat belts.",5
"Decowall Dw-1205, 27 Transport Wall Stickers/wall Decals/wall Transfers/wall Tattoos/wall Sticker","We put these up on our toddler's walls recently and they're fantastic! The colors are very bright, they come off the backing without tearing, stick to the wall easily and are very easy to re-position. They're a good size too, so you don't need that many - unless you're like us and want to create a huge traffic jam around your child's bedroom!",5
Kid's Healthy Eating Cow Sippy Cup - With Dual Spill Proof or Freeflow Mode - Over 25 Million Sold,"I like the way it looks so much, i didn't care that it's only 99% leak proof.  I live in Wisconsin and we're cheese heads, so the cup is just the perfect print.  :)",5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"We got this as a baby shower gift and just love it. We put my son in this since birth and he was always interested in it. He is now 2 1/2 months and still just loves this toy. The only problem was that after 1 month the vibrator part just got sooooo loud. Since we got it as a gift we did not have a receipt but Babies """"R"""" Us still exchanged it for a new one. We are still very happy with this product.",4
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","Simple, soft, and washes well, we have a few of these, they are very soft, wash well and seem to wear well.",5
"Lamaze High-Contrast Little Knotties Baby Toy, Skunk",Love the contrast of the item and the rattle/crinkle features. Only reason the product didn't get 5 stars is the lack of a hook for hanging and the loop on top is pretty small (ok if you have small hooks/links).,4
"Cosco Funsport Playard, Into the Woods","Need an explanation as to how the Dream on Me 3"" mattress fits the Cosco Funsport Playard. Dimensions for Playard are 27.5 x 43.25 and the mattress dimensions are 25.5 x 37.5 which means 2 inches of space in width and 6 inches difference in length. I really love the playard and want to order but after reading the reviewer who stated that there was so much slack room between mattress, I am hesitant. Shouldn't the mattress be snug so the baby can't get trapped between?http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JU0H7I/ref=ox_sc_act_title_2?ie=UTF8&smid;=ATVPDKIKX0DER and I had to go to an outside source to get the dimensions for both.",2
"Munchkin 4 Pack Re-Usable Twist Tight Spill Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary",Beware.  These cups do leak from the spout.  Easy to wash and store.  Would not buy again as every time my son throws it the milk spills out.,1
Baby Luv Nightlight and Music Turtle and Animals (Black and White),"Sound is very loud! Stars are great. Baby loves all the colors. Songs are good, but far too loud, scares baby.",3

"Bamboobies 2 Pair Ultra-Thin Regular Nursing Pads, Pale Pink","These are the best nursing pads I have found so far. They do not show under clothes, and do not leak as long as you are not a heavy leaker. All other reusable nursing pads have leaked and been visible through my clothes. These are also incredibly soft and comfortable. I wish I had purchased them sooner!",5
"Brown Monkey Baby Bottle Holder for Hands Free Bottle Feeding by Bebe Bottle Sling, LLC",Must have baby item.Only down side it if the baby is not actively drinking from the bottle the bottle may leak onto the baby so make sure your baby is wearing a bib.,5
Ginsey Sesame Street Soft Potty Seat with Removable Soft Splash Guard,I have been struggling getting my son to even just sit on the potty. Adding this seat after a suggestion from a friend was the ticket. While he still is not ready to potty train the toilet doesnt seem as scary with this seat. It is comfy and has seasame street people on it. I actually got him to sit on the potty with this seat. I highly recommend this over a potty chair. You wont have to dump a bowl of pee or poo if you train them this way!,5
green sprouts Natural Bowl,"Received a couple of these bowls and initially loved them....I would hand wash and dry them and the kids would eat out of them....then about a week or two later, i suppose i didnt dry them good enough and took them out for the kids and there was mold all over them. we had to throw them out...waste of money.",1
"Evenflo Jump &amp; Go Baby Exerciser, Red Racer","i bought this for my nephew and although he did take a while to start jumping, he loves it. i recommend it for 5 month olds up.",5
Evenflo Titan Elite DLX Convertible Car Seat - Montgomery,"This child seat is a great buy - have had it for about 4 months now and am really impressed with it. My 16 month-old loves his comfortable seat, especially since he has started facing forward. The build quality is good, and the accessories are great - especially the ability to fit both the cup-holder and the little snack box on either side of this seat.The only issue I have with this seat is that it does not come with a neck-rest attachment. That would be a great addition to this seat, however I got myself one from the store real cheap...Overall, a great buy for the price...",4
"Philips AVENT 8 Ounce Natural Glass Bottles, 2-Pack",The glass bottles are nice but the whole bottle is useless all thanks to the new nipples. Our baby had a very tough time maintaining a good seal around the nipple and as a result milk would spill all around his neck. We initially thought it was the flow rate on the nipple but after trying different Avent nipples (that have slower flow rates) and getting the same messy results we decided to return the entire bottle set and get the Dr. Brown's glass bottle set instead.,1
"Pickles 30X40&quot; Journey Fleece Baby Blanket, Tiger","I love this blanket. I ordered it for my son who isn't here yet but will be arriving on the 9th. It is sooo soft and cozy, I'm really picky about fabrics but this blanket was well worth the price. cant wait to use it for my baby boy. good quality",5
"Munchkin Arm &amp; Hammer 3-in-1 Potty Seat withPotty Wipes, 72-Count","The potty comes conveniently already set up and the first thing  I noticed when we opened it was the smell. Not a nasty smell, but a very nice smell that smells almost like something I can eat. It turned out to be the Arm & Hammer Deodorizing disc with odor eliminating baking soda which is used for odor control. I don't think I'll need an air freshener with that around. I love the fact that it can be used as a step stool and when my daughter stepped on it there was no fear of it tipping over. I must say that it is indeed sturdily made.Once it's opened it comes with this handy convenient toddler flushable wipes. Yay for your bathroom toilet because we all know you're not supposed to flush baby wipes down there. The great thing about these is that these comes as refills which can be purchased separately but it does come with 2 and each contains 36 wipes.The deodorizer was a very simple install. Just click and its in. Right above the potty seat.  The only problem I really had, and it was a very small problem was getting the flushable wipes in the side where it belongs. I love where it is located. My toddler can grab it easily and when she finally understand how to properly wipe she can do this for herself.The white removable trainer seat can be used on the toilet when she's big enough to use the adult toilet like a big kid. The green bowl is where everything is collected and is very easy to clean. It is relatively small compared to some we've seen but not too small to be considered unusable.We love that it is a complete potty training system. Now you longer have to buy a potty training seat for the toilet. You also don't have to buy a step stool either. The deodorizer is a very nice added touch. No one really needs to leave the bathroom smelling stinky. This will clearly clear up all that stinky smell. You will surely be saving money in the long run by buying this and to be honest you really don't need to buy the flushable wipes refill, they're really just recommended.So yes we love our new potty and we recommend it! It gets my toddlers Two Tiny Thumbs Up!  You can find a full review with photos on our blog GrowingUpMadison.com",5
Munchkin 3 Count Stay Put Suction Bowl,"I bought these because my son loves to push his bowl, plate, cup, etc all over his highchair tray and then pick them up and dump them (usually on his head).  I thought the suction base on these would alleviate this, I was wrong and other reviewers were correct.  The suction does not work.  I tried the water trick and put all my force into sticking the bowl to his tray and within minutes he had it loose and had dumped his dinner on his head.It is nice that they come in bright and fun colors with secure lids though, makes it easy to store in the fridge or take snacks along on outings.",3
Cloth Diaper Doublers,"These are atually better then the ""liners"" of the same brand. They're cheap, and abosorb quite a bit, they're just small, I have to pair them with something else, and my 1 year old is not a heavy wetter. I can make better ones myself.",3
ECO CUP &amp; I Am Not a Paper Cup Replacement Coffee Cup Lid Blue Silicone,Great replacement lid.  My original lid developed a tear along the drinking area- not sure how.  I hope this replacement will last longer.,5
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","Love this stroller so far! It's perfect for my 10 month old son & I'm sure will be with us for a while to come. It folds up compact & fits nicely in the rear of our car. I love the pouch that fits over the handles. It can contain a lot of stuff. The stroller handles well. The only downside is the basket underneath is small, which I knew by reading other reviews. I can hang the diaper bag on the back & haven't had any worries of the stroller tipping over.",4
Triple 8 FLO Diaper Sprayer,Even on our low pressure well water this diaper sprayer worked really well. I love the ability to easily turn the water pressure up and down when you need to. Best diaper sprayer that we tried!,5
"Gerber Graduate BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips Spill Proof Cup, 7 Ounce, Colors May Vary",I have tried pretty much everything on the market and these come closer to not leaking than any other I've tried.  I highly recommend them.,5
"Mommy's Helper Slide-Lok Bi-Fold Door Lock, 2 Count",Best idea EVER!!!,5
"C.R. Gibson Stepping Stones Baby Photo Album, Jungle Friends","It was very cute. I was looking for some thing for my oldest son's hand and foot prints seeing as his father never let me frame them and this matched his crib set he had 17 years ago! I was a bit disappointed with the construction of the frame it's just pressed paper, the ones I have for his younger siblings are ceramic. But I was just more happy with the fact that I had found his crib design after all these years. It does look great on the wall.",3
Nasal Aspirator in Sage,"The only nasal aspirator that works well is the one that comes home with the baby from the hospital. I have no idea where you can buy those, but they are most effective.",2
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"I wish I had bought this years ago! It is spanned across our open concept home to keep my kids out of the kitchen/dining area. It is not wobbling like I thought it might, very sturdy and is working PERFECTLY! I now have a little bit of sanity back and am able to keep my home a lot safer for my young kids. I have also used it to hold my German Shorthair Pointer puppies. Love that the kids and dogs can't climb over it (so far!).",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","We had two babies 17 months apart. They are 5 and 6 now and they still flop jump in there, especially my 5 year old son (his fort). We now have a 9 month old and I researched a lot of other 'play areas' etc but I'm going to end up buying the same thing. Safe, fun, will not collapse and fall down, etc. And&#8230;no little guy (9-14 months is hurling themselves out of this thing) From what I understand a lot of kids climb out of others that are shorter.Believe me, I'm done looking at this eye sore, but can say from experience that it will keep your little lady/guy safe and occupied and will stay with them a little while longer. **you do have to buy some cute secure hanging light up fun things when they are little for the sides. Besides that, I can't actually believe I'm buying the same thing 6 years later.  Worth it. My first Amazon review, btw.",5
Door Flip Lock for Child Safety from PrimeLine - White Color,"It works exactly the way it says it will.4 stars because of three small problems:1 - hinge should be slightly small, so that it doesn't scratch the door2 - it required little practice to lift it and tilt it to open3 - quality of screws supplied with it",4
"BreathableBaby Breathable Bumper for Portable and Cradle Cribs, White",Perfect fit for the Davinci mini cribs.,5

"Zebra Baby Blanket in Faux Fur with Black Satin Ruffle and Ultra Lux Plush White Swirl on Back, An Alexander Timothy Designer Baby Throw","These are the softest baby blankets I have ever felt! My little boys loved them, even my baby who is hard to get to smile was grinning while holding it. Beautiful fabrics and perfect for snuggling little ones.",5
Edushape Small Sensory Balls,"My 1yr old loves them, they are easy to handle and fun to bounce!I recommend this product for babies and toddlers",5
Infantino Cozy Rider,My baby weighs 12 pounds and I found it very difficult to put him in and take him out of this carrier. His legs wanted to slide in the arm holes and his head was slouched too far down. I actually had to lay down on the bed to take him out of it. Bottom line--carrier is too hard to place baby in!! I ended up returning!!,1
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx","easy to install, comfortable for my daughter, and comes with the safety of britax.  we were planning on getting a 3-in-1 but a friend told us that this is better for a 2-year old since the straps are lower and the seat is more padded.  we are happy we went with his recommendation.",5
"Sumersault 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set, Show Doggies",I love this collection. It is well made and the &#34;hand stitched&#34; look is adorable. I bought this for my son but I could see this in a girls room too. Who doesn't like puppies? I would suggest checking out ebay as there is an artist that does prints to match this collection. It adds the perfect finishing touch.,5
Funky Zebra Fitted Crib Sheet for Baby and Toddler Bedding Sets by Sweet Jojo Designs - Zebra Print Microsuede,Had this item within like 3 days of ordering it.. I love the zebra sheet it looks great in my little girls room.,5
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Blue and White (Previous Model)","These wraps are huge. They make great swaddling blankets. I highly recommend them! They feel soft too, and they get softer with every wash. We use these to wrap our baby in after he wakes up from his naps; it keeps him warm but not too warm like a fleece blanket would. I also have been using them while nursing.",5
"Obersee Kid's All-in-One Pre-School Backpacks with Integrated Cooler, Rhinestone Angel Wings",Christmas present for grandson - he loves it and we will probably have to get him another one - I'm sure he'll wear it out one of these days!,5
"American Baby Company Full Size  30&quot; X  40&quot; - 100% Cotton Thermal Blanket, Blue",This is pretty much an average thermal weave baby-sized blanket. The color (green) is a bit different from the picture in the listing. Would probably be better off shopping locally at Target or WalMart for something like this.,2
Walker With Toy Bar,"I chose this walker because it's tray was free of clutter and easy to clean. The toy bear bar is easy to remove and reattach.  The wheels roll easily on hard wood floors without leaving marks, and is easy for baby to manuver.  It's seat has adjustable heights to accomodate the growing baby.  It is also balanced well so that baby can not tip it over.  We tend our grandson frequently and appreciate the freedom this gives each of us.",5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I really like our new Joovy Caboose stroller.  It was very easy to put together.  It fits in the trunk of my '04 Honda Accord.  My 3 year old toddler loves it because she has an option to sit or stand.My issues with this stroller:It is a little heavy but not too bad.  While sitting, my toddler will drag her feet or mess with the brakes, but that's not the strollers fault.  I also have no place to put my diaper bag if my 3 year old is riding.I'm glad I purchased this stroller even though it has a few issues.  It has allowed me to take my daughters to the zoo and do some shopping that I couldn't do without it.",4
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Love this pillow!!! I had been having a hard time sleeping especially on my left side, until I got this pillow. It worked immediately, I was able to take an uniterrupted 3 hour nap using this pillow about 30 min. after I opened it and read the directions/ looked at the demonstration pictures. I also used this pillow to support me as I sit up in bed (reading, eating, watching t.v.) and for extra support while sitting on the sofa. I've even caught my husband using it while sitting up in bed!! The size and shape may seem intimidating at first glance, but it's very easy to use.  The biggest drawback has been that it doesn't stay in it's pillowcases very well and finding a use for now that I am no longer pregnant.  I tried using it for nursing as its manual suggested, but found it too cumbersome.  I got a lot of use of it while I was pregnant though, and would buy it again.",4
Mac &amp; Cool Quick Cooling Dish,"Given the price of this item, most parents of toddlers should have one of these.  It's just flat out so useful to not have to stick plates of hot food in the freezer for a few minutes, or to deal with trying to spread out hot food on plates and blow on all of it.- really works for any hot food.  Any microwave food, etc- Cleans well- easy- Pop it right back in the freezerIt's just one of those no-brainer products.  It might seem gimmicky, but it's not really.  It's a basic thing that you will reach for every time you have something steaming hot and a hungry 2 year old.My daughter is just shy of 2, and I probably use this dish every other day.",5
"Graco Quilted Pack 'n Play Sheet, Light Blue",Fits great and offers decent padding for baby. Doesn't bunch up in the middle like some do. Love the baby blue color.,5
Medela Harmony to Symphony Conversion Kit,I bought this conversion kit for a pump that we are provided at work.  It is perfect and works great.  My only complaint is that there was only one in stock and I needed two.  I use this everyday and works like a champ!,5
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Cradle 'n Swing, Rainforest Friends",I was looking for a swing for my baby. And i found it here at amazon .And i really love it for the price.Its a good item.I recived in two days free shiping.I dont use the battery . Only the AC.This is my opinnion about the item.,5
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundle Me, Graphite",This is perfect for a new baby.  It's soft and warm and you completely zip off the top if it's too warm outside for it.  I love the graphite color - -we weren't sure if we were having a boy or girl so it would work well for either.  I haven't washed it yet but it appears it would clean up nice as well.,5
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice Accu Scan Ear Thermometer,"The thermometer works fine, unfortunately you will not find replacement covers ANYWHERE! and the thermometer will not function without a cover. I purchased my thermometer from ToysRUs and they don't even carry the covers. I'd recommend buying another brand, for example I've seen the Thermoscan covers almost everywhere I've looked.",1
Boutique Brand New GEENNY Lavender Butterfly 13PCS Baby Nursery CRIB BEDDING SET,I really like this purchase. The butterfly theme is great and the purple goes great with gray!!! Can't wait for my baby to enjoy the room as much as me.,5
"First Essential Silicone Bottle, 9 Ounce, Pack of 3, Blue/Green, 9-Count","Being a first time mom I spent months before my LO was born trying to decide what bottles to buy just in case breast feeding didn't go as I had planned. I bout several different &#34;special, no air, no bubbles, etc&#34; bottles that cost a lot more than these. After maybe 2 weeks of breast feeding I ran out of milk, those special bottles I wasted time and money on all looked like they could keep air out but ended up having him taking more air in because their thought of making the bottles more realistic to act as a breast or be formed like one is not a good idea at all. There will never be a bottle that can replace your breast, I see that now. I have bought the most expensive and least expensive, the closer it gets to seeming perfect it ended up being worst. These bottles worked the best, believe it or not out of all the bottles he gets little to no air with this one only!! His lips can go completely around the top and the suction power he can get by latching on to the small nipples allows him to avoid any gaps that cause him to suck in air like the bigger more complicated nipples to mimic real breastfeeding. Love it & at 8 months he is still using them, moving on to sippy cups now.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Received three extension pieces with this set.  It works, can't find much to complain about.  If you have a big dog, or a big baby who may have the strength, they can probably damage the spindles or move the gate if they place a lot of pressure on it.",4
The First Years Babypro Sterilizer,Its a great idea but needs improvement.Dont use this to clean breast flow bottle nipples...they will start to melt.Hard to clean but fits many many things to clean.,3
Playtex Diaper Genie On The Go Dispenser Refills,We love this. It's so small and easy to clean up on the go with this little gem. So much easier than packing around random plastic bags. So many places won't let you throw away diapers and it makes it easy to take dirty diapers with us. Bags have a gentle scent as well.,5
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","Definitely, the only diaper sacks I use now.  They are roomy, strong, and you get a ton in the box.  They fit easily in your purse or diaper bag.I tried another brand I bought at Target.  They fell apart in a heartbeat and I was back to the Sassy Baby ones!",5
Saddle Style Soaker Mattress Pad - Will Absorb 6 Cups of Liquid - Made in America (34&quot; X 36&quot;),"I was happy with the quality just disappointed that the pee pad does not cover a normal size twin mattress and the siding starts before the sides of the twin bed begins. So, I hope my son is never laying near the sides of the bed and has an accident or it will leak through!",4
Bright Starts 2-in-1 Convert Me Activity Table and Gym,"Fabulous gift for a very young baby. And, it converts later to a table baby can use as he grows.",5
"BABYBJORN Plate and Spoon, Turquoise/Orange, 2-Count",Clings to high-chair table-top and is very hard to tip over by baby as she feeds herself and not too deep.,5
"Badger Basket Two Bin Storage Cubby, Red",I have had these cubbies for about 1.5 years. Structurally they have held together very well.  These are extremely handy for storage. The cubbies were easy to assemble. They stack together perfectly and do not slide around. The finish has  worn more than I think it should have. They came with cheesy brown stickers to cover the screws. The stickers will have to be replaced over time. This purchase was a good value for the cost.,5
"Gunamuna Gunapod Wearable Baby Sleepsack, Chocolate, Medium","This is a comfy, unique, zippers everywhere dream sack! What I love most is that you can unzip the bottom to change diapers in the middle of the night w/o baby getting cold! And it washes so well.",4
"Kids Line Jungle 123 Hamper, Brown",This hamper looks just like the picture.  It is a useful size.  It has a mesh liner which makes removing the dirty clothes very easy. You can through the liner in the wash too.  It also means you don't have to wash the actual hamper (which probably wouldn't work too well).,5
"Infantino Breathe Vented Carrier, Grey","We registered for this carrier before my son was born.  To its credit, it does feel fairly secure; he seems comfortable and it carries him snugly against me.  Two major problems.1.  Without a waist strap, it is very hard to get the baby out of the carrier without help.  When you try to lift him out, the entire carrier rises up instead of the baby sliding out.  We bought an Evenflo carrier at Walmart for $30 for my husband to use (so we wouldn't have to adjust the straps every time we switched who carries him).  That one has a side opening, which makes it easier to get the baby out.  Also, it has a waist strap so the entire carrier doesn't rise up when you lift the baby out.2.  Larger concern.  Almost every time I take my son out of this, I scratch his chubby little thighs.  There is a stiff place in the carrier that rubs against the baby's legs when you pull him out.  It's not bad - hasn't drawn blood or anything and he's never fussed about it.  But it leaves a little pink mark on the outside of his thighs.I think we're going to give up on this carrier and buy another one with a waist strap for me to use so I can get him in and out without help and without scratching his legs.  The Infanito is a decent product for the low cost (especially compared with some that are over $100) but there are better options out there without paying too much more.",2
Night &amp; Day Bottle Warmer,"My husband and I debated about whether a bottle warmer was even necessary, but in the end - I won, and this is the one I chose!  This little unit is extremely handy for middle of the night feedings.  I had the timing down so that the bottle would finish warming almost exactly when I would be done changing my daughter's diaper.  Any amount of time that you can save in the middle of the night is worth it in my opinion.  However, I also found that you have to pay attention to what kind of bottle you're trying to heat and make sure you measure the right amount of water to put in the unit, so that the bottle gets heated enough.  If you set yourself up before you go to bed and fill the included water vials which attach neatly to the side, you won't have to be figuring these things out at 3 am!Overall, we've been very happy with this unit - especially the cooler section in the back!  That's another great feature that allows you to not have to make a trip to the fridge in the middle of the night!!",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I wish I had read the detailed reviews before purchase - I bought this as a travel bed for my nearly-18-month daughter. She adored it as a place to sit, but lying down on it was impossible because the strap that runs through the middle doesn't yield at all (leaving her with something digging into and raising her middle). We tried to open it out as much as possible, thinking extra tension on the rest of the cot would help, but it didn't. It would definitely require something like two pillows or a thick pad of some kind, which renders it useless to me because I would primarily be using it for the times when I travel alone with her and need to pack as lightly as I can manage. I am in the process of returning this.",1
Prorap Classic Diaper Covers - White - Large,"I bought three of these nine months ago for our little guy; he was a year old then (is now 20 months old) and these wraps have been great.  I have tried to refrain from putting them in the dryer, but we have forgotten more than a few times and they still work great.  The wraps we had before (a different brand) lost their waterproof quality after being washed and dried in the dryer a few times.  The only problem, which is easily fixed, is if you don't line up the velcro, the edges curl slightly and can irritate baby's skin about where a diaper pin would be.  No problem if you just stick your hand inside between the velcroed part and baby to make sure you don't feel anything rough and if you do, adjust it a little.",5
"36 Baby Spoon Souvenir Spoon Display Case Rack Cabinet, REAL Glass Door, (SP01-WA)","This is the second cabinet I have ordered from this company and as advertised, its just what I had hoped for. They hold all of my wife's spoons from our travels in one place, (Thank God!) as her collection has continued to grow.The quality of this item is high end, all wood components and includes hanging brackets for wall mount.Look no further, this is the real deal.",5
"UPPAbaby 2013 G-Luxe Stroller, Sebby Teal","Excellent lightweight stroller overall. I only wish It was a little bit easier to fold with one hand, when carrying the baby.",4
BUMKINS BPA FREE Super Bib 3 pack Dr. Seuss design,"BEST BIB EVER!  Seriously!  You will NEVER need another one.  WAterproof, but not hard, inflexible, or uncomfortable.  You will be absolutely AMAZED at the amount of money you'll save from not having to buy so much stain remover.  I used to go through about 2-3 bottles of stain remover a month, now it's 1/2 to 1!  Machine-washable, too!",5
Stephan Baby Silver Plated 4&quot; Keepsake Rattle,"My 8 month granddaughter started playing this rattle as soon as I put it in her hand!  Purchased this rattle to help her sore gums.  Also to replace the silver heart bracelet I wear that she loves to chew.  The rattle is much better, she loves it.",5
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,Absolutely great cup; easy  to use and doesn't spill but I am uncomfortable putting milk on it since the straw is so difficult to clean but I don't regret the purchase. My son loves it.,4
"Tiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friends","Our grandson notices the movement and music, but the stuffed animals seem like blobs to adults. Maybe they look better to babies, but they aren't very well defined. I do like the fact that it can be moved from crib to play yard",3
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump,"This pump was recommended by one of the nurses from my breastfeeding class.  I'm glad she recommended it because it works great and was less expensive than Medela's pumps.  It doesn't come with a bag, but I just use an extra diaper bag to carry the pump in to and from work.  I highly recommend!!  Part can be bought at Babies R Us too.",5
Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball,Really colorful and carches my grandson's attention. He plays with it and finds new parts to it each time a new discovery,5
Diaper Dude Chicago Cubs Diaper Bag,"A diaper bag that a man will carry, YEAH!!!!!  Sometimes I use if we are carrying alot.  The messager bag style allows for comfort and keeps the bag out of your way.  Worth the money.",5
"ERGObaby Front Pouch, Camel","I've been using this as a purse since I got it two days ago.  The strap is a perfect length for a crossbody carry and it's so tiny I don't even have to take it off when I get in the car.  It also velcros around the strap of my Beco Gemini, on a side or back of the waist strap (beco doesn't make a comparable product).  I will mostly use it on the carrier when we travel on airlines, and it will work fine for that, boarding passes will fit in folded in half.  For reference, my cell phone is the size of an Iphone, and it fits comfortably and completely in the open pocket, but a larger tablet crossbreed like a Galaxy OneNote would probably only fit inside the big compartment.  The big compartment is only wide enough to hold a pair of sunglasses or something similar.  A newborn or maybe a size one diaper might fit, but you would have to really smoosh it in, but I didn't buy it for a diaper bag replacement, so I don't care about that personally.",5
Blankets and Beyond Rosette Baby Blanket with Toy Rattle Blue,I bought this for a friends baby shower. She loved it. Its so soft inside and out and comes with a cute bunny rattle for a very good price. I wish I had one when my son was that little,5
Gerber 12-Pack Prefold Birdseye 3-Ply Cloth Diapers with Padding - White,After searching for burp cloths my girlfriend recommended using these.  Let me tell you...it was the best purchase I made.  They are the perfect size and are very absorbant.  I have yet to be surprised with what these diapers can't do!,5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,Great stroller and the price is awesome for an item of this quality.,5
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator - Choose from Blue or Magenta Colors (Blue),"First off I want to start by saying this item works. Now that that's said, you are Basicly sucking snot from your kids nose. The only thing between you and snot is a piece of tissue. Very simple to use and effective. Your just sucking snot. If you can get over this, your home free.",3
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"This is definitely one of the better options for a double-sided bed rail. However, the installation instructions were a bit odd and it took a while to get it secure enough that I felt safe with my toddler in it. So far it's done the job perfectly!",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"It is a bit pricey, but our son loves his Sophie the Giraffe!  Even though he doesn't really hold onto things yet he likes to put her feet in his mouth and watch me move her in front of him.  Can't wait until he starts to play on his own with her, it is nice to know she's safe to chew on!",5
"Jeep Back Seat Baby View Mirror, Black","Like that there are vertical and horizontal straps, HOWEVER, the horizontal straps weren't long enough to wrap all the way around my car's headrest (Acura MDX).  I love that the mirror telescopes and is a nice neutral black.  The cushion is a nice touch too, to not gouge your headrest... but since the straps didn't fit, I couldn't use it.  Am using the Britax one instead.",2
"6-Pack BPA Free Waisted Baby Bottles, 6 oz., Girl Colors","The baby bottles are great, but the only issue i have is that the nippples are too small for the rings, therefore it leeks.",3
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,"I did  some research and read numerous favorable  reviews for this high  chair.  It easy to assemble, just the right size, and adjustable.  The product description is true to it's word that is easy to clean, including  the safety straps.  Also love that I can attach and release the tray with one hand. Baby is currently 6 months old and weighs 16.5  lbs. There is lots of room for him when he gets bigger.  As an added bonus, the price is also the most economical for all the  features it has.  For anyone buying baby products, I would recommend reading different web site reviews, which are free to view.  Also,  there are Consumers Reports articles and ratings (there is an annual subscription cost to see on line CR ratings)",5
"Philips AVENT 9 Ounce BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup, 1-Pack, Red","My daughter loves her Philips Avent BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup.  Instead of transitioning to a sippy cup, we opted to go straight to a 'normal' cup rim.  We had to guide her at first, but she quickly learned to grab the handles and drink for herself.  She is now 1 year old and independently drinking from this cup.  It is leak proof, as long as baby isn't pressing down on the pressure plate and holding it at an angle!  Comes apart quickly and cleans easily, but we only use this for water anyway.",4
"Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, Red",I love the idea of this and the quality is good but we hardly use it because it doesn't fit on a lot of tables due to their thickness.The image shows a table about 1.5 inches thick. The granite bar in the kitchen was too thick and the patio table was too thin so I had to add a piece of plywood.,3
Safety 1st Lift Lock and Swing Gate,"This gate only looks nice on one side. From the other side, you can see why the gate is so flimsy. It is very poorly designed. Also, to adjust this gate for a different location in your house, you have to loosen and then tighten 4 screws.I recommend model 41823 instead. It looks better, feels sturdier, and is easier to adjust. It is also harder for a toddler to climb.",1
GIRAFFE CoziCover (for SoftSpot by Wozzy Play Mat),This cover is very soft and fits the mat well. It's also made in a way that spit up is easily wiped up and doesn't soak in or stain.,5
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Extra Tall Walk-Thru","I ordered this gate to put at the top on stairs outside because it matched the color. It came with one of the spindles already broken on the bottom, but decided to keep it anyway. I tried to use the pressure method to secure it to the side rails but it would come off every time it was opened and the pressure was released. I did not want to drill holes because then I would have a rust issue with the wrought iron. So I used heavy duty zip ties to hold it in place. It is a temporary solution until I replace the gate with a wrought iron gate.",3
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Activity Gym,I love this item -  it's so cute and well made.  Perfect for our woodland themed nursery.  I would purchase this again in a heartbeat!,5
"BFlowerYan Door Stop Finger Pinch Guard , Mixed Color [4pc-pack] (4xanimal)","Wow, I was really impressed that these cute foam animals work! Even when my husband slams the door they do the job.",5
"Summer Infant Fox &amp; Friends Sweet Comfort Musical Bouncer, Espresso",I preordered this item and when it finally came in stock I received it faster then expected! Great bouncer for the price. Easy to put together. Can't wait to have our soon to be here baby test it out,5
"Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue","We got this product as a gift and did not realize at the time how necessary it is!  In a new parents' tired confused stupor waking every hour to 2 hours for weeks at a time, it is hard to remember what happened over the course of a blurry sleepless night.  This was mostly useful at night.  My husband was very helpful taking turns getting up in the middle of the night but without referring to the itzbeen, I would have to wake him back up to find out whether he fed her, changed her diaper, when he got up last, etc.The only downside is that the timers have been resetting themselves lately.  Maybe the batteries are dying...We're definitely going to buy the Itzbeen as gifts for expecting friends / family!",4
Slip-X Solutions Tub Tattoos: Clownfish,"They sold it, I bought it. I see they didn't review my purchase, but I'm being asked to review their sale.  I bought it, they sold it.",5
"Perfect Bum Fashion Basic Print Kit, Floral Tile, Small","I am loving this product!  The inserts need a little spot remover before being washed after a messy diaper, but otherwise it works great!",5
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","This blanket is nice because it is a little more flexible to the size of your baby, but does not cause baby to stop fidgeting or sleep through the night as suggested... but maybe this is just my baby.",3
BEABA Babycook PRO - Sorbet,"We bought this for our daughter who has twins. She says it is very easy to use and it does a great job of preparing meals for her kids. Twins are a hand full and time is very valuable, so meets all of her expectations.",5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Pink","This kick and play occupies my daughter for hours daily. She started using it around a month a half. Every month (4 months now) she loves it more and more. She spends hours laughing at herself in the mirror and kicking on the piano. It's a very versatile product that can be used for a long time because it has so many convertible options, also. This is a must-have for every parent.",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","I bought this carseat a couple of months ago and it does its job :)  I have an Eddie Bauer one as well, so I have to say compared to that one it's bulkier/material's not as soft/straps and the buckle aren't as ""comfortable"" as the Eddie Bauer one, but it works great!  My son looks happy and comfortable in it, kids aren't usually as picky as we adults are about those kinds of things LOL I'm glad I bought it, great size, great price, love the cup holder!",4
"timi &amp; leslie Tag - a - Long Diaper Bag, Sahara Brown",Love the pockets inside and out. Perfect to sort and store multiple things especially if you want to put in something ina hurry,4
"The Shower Hug for Pregnant and Nursing Moms., X/S, White with Petal Pink Trim","I didnt' have this product when i had my first baby, and i remember having VERY sensitive nipples pre birth and post birth (especially with early breastfeeding). The shower stung as it hit my nipples and even the mildest soaps & shampoos burned!! So I got this to use for my 2nd pregnancy/post birth and i LOVED it.  it shielded my nipples from stinging shower spray and soaps/shampoos, while also holding the warmth of the water on my boobs. I loved it so much I've gifted this to two mamas-to-be!",5
Infantino Wonder Whale Kicks and Giggles Gym,This is a great toy that encouranges interest and strengthens kicking with good visual motor skills coordination.  Babies love this and it keeps them content.,5
"C.R. Gibson Slim Bound Journal Album for Photos, Happi Baby Girl",This photo album is cute and so far has held up very well. There is space to write next to each picture and the design is one of the cutest I've seen for boy photo albums.,5
"Carters Super Soft Bumper, Pink","My wife thought about making bumpers, but for the time and cost of materials it was better to just buy these. They are soft and work great, especially when your baby starts to crawl around. No more waking up to crying with her head mashed against the crib sides.",5
BRICA Stretch-to-Fit Window Shade,"I bought this product specifically to put in the back window of my Camry, since it showed pictures of being used in the back window. Well, it certainly stopped the sun from getting in my baby's eyes. Unfortunately, it also stopped me from being able to see out my back window. It was also not that easy to install. If you're looking for something for a window you need to see out of, this is not it. (If you find something that actually works for that purpose, please let me know!)",2
Sesame Street Construction Zone 4 Piece Toddler Set,This sheet set is great! After reading some of the reviews I decided to try anyway since the price was good. I was pleasanly surprised! The entire set was actually super soft and not stiff at all! Right out of the package! I love it! The colors are vibrant and no wrinkles after wash and dry! I LOVE IT! and so does my 2 1/2 year old!,5
"Baby Aspen Farm Fannies Diaper Cover, Cow","Wish that Baby Aspen made Farm Fannies in more than just this one version! I'd buy the whole darn farm if it was available. These are stinkin' cute, well made, & adorable fabric. Would totally recommend. My babies butt is the cutest.",5
"phil&amp;teds Traveller Crib, Black","Phil and Teds is a marketing company. They purchased the company from a father and son (Phil and Ted) and have lost all sense of quality. This crib, is lite and looks good but that is where it stops. The inflatable mattress does not provide enough padding, the materials leak color and the frame is weak. We (and my brother) have retuned ours.",1
Sassy Wonder Wheel,"Purchased this for my baby at 6 months. Baby loved touching the different textures, spinning it, listening to the rattling sounds when it spins, looking at the colors. At 7.5, it is still one of her favorites. She still love doing all the stuff previously mentioned, but now she is strong enough to pluck the wonder wheel off a table and disengage the suction cup holding it down. She likes to flip it upside down and chew on the rubbery suction cup. She likes banging it around and then flinging it on the floor and watch me pick it up for her. This little thing provides baby with lots of entertainment value. Would recommend.",5
"Stork Craft Aspen Combo Dresser Chest, Natural","First off, I did not get this item from Amazon, I got it from a big store for $100 dollars less. Also I chose this item because it was an appropriate height for me and my fiance, we are very tall!Whenever I get furniture that must be assembled, the first thing I do is organize the parts and take inventory.Let me repeat that: I TAKE INVENTORY.After organizing all of the little hardware pieces into ice cube trays I thought I was missing two parts, but upon calling storkcraft, A very nice man explained to me that part N just looks different than the illustration, and that parts O and P come screwed together, I wasn't missing any parts.Parts 1, 9, and 5 seem like they are not labeled, but they are...just in a more roundabout way. 1 and 5 have two stickers on them, 1 has 2 and 3 because parts 2 and 3 go in on those sides.Other items that weren't labeled were probably not labeled because their was only one of them and its obvious what it is, also the less stickers I have to remove the happier I am.Granted, I hate instructions without words. But I am an intelligent human being, and with some patience and planning my fiance and I put this together with relative ease in just about 2 hours. We only messed up once and it was an easy fix.Everything was packages nicely, the only dings came from us.WE PUT IT TOGETHER CORRECTLY AND IT IS EXTREMELY SOLID. The people that reviewed this item and said it was cheap, or unstable clearly did not put it together correctly or have the patience to attempt to understand the instructions.I mean, for the $250 I spent, I feel like we got a really good piece of furniture that will last many children. Also, you can't get solid wood furniture for under $700, it's impossibly. Yes the drawer bottoms are particle board, but it's a $300 dresser, what do you expect?UPDATE: two years later and it is still doing ok. The biggest ""fail"" is that the guide rails for the drawers shimmied loose, but we glued them back in. And the door squeaks. Also the knobs kind of suck, but again, we just glued them and they are fine. This is not an heirloom piece, but it works just fine.",4
"Britax B-Safe Infant Car Seat, Black","I think there are better options out there, my son is 6 months and the car seat has always been very heavy and now the straps are too short. I recommend you look at other options, plus the fabric does makes my son sweat sometimes. If I were to buy a car seat for infants again I would not buy this one.",2
Hallmark 2011 - My 4th Fourth Christmas,This was just what we were looking for. It arrived promptly and in perfect condition. Thank you once again Amazon *****,5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Formula Dispenser/Snack Cup,Super convenient!,5
Cloud B Twilight Ladybug - Pink,I bought this for a gift for my niece. It actually came with battery's that were dead of course. But once i installed a fresh set she totally loved it she is 8 years old.,5
Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball,Bought this for my granddaugter when she was about 6 months old.  It's very colorful and easy to grab. She loves thespinning parts and the mirror.  Keeps her entertained.,4
Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball,"We bought this for our four month old (he's almost five months) because we went back in for a missed vaccination and he took it like a champ..no tears! While looking around Walmart, we stumbled across this toy in the baby section. We showed it to him and he was instantly interested (he hasn't found many toys that he really seems to like). Since that day, he has  played with this toy every day. He chews on it, he bats at it, he watches mesmerized as I make the little button squeak (which of course is also a hit with the dogs....). This toy was also cheaper at Walmart. Under seven dollars! Worth every penny. Totally recommend! (and this is my second child, so I'm no stranger to the baby toy market!)",5
"Thirsties Hemp Inserts 2 Pack, Small 6-18 Lbs","The quality of this product is great: thin, super absorbent. I usually put one or two on top of a bumgenius microfiber insert in a Thirsties or Econobum cover. I love how soft and breathable the fabric is for my LO's diaper area. Since it is so absorbent, it takes twice as long as my other inserts to dry even tho it is much thinner than my other diapers or inserts. I would make sure you have lots of variety in your stash so you aren't just waiting around for the hemp products to dry but it really does make a great addition to any stash. Also, they stain super easy...I haven't tried to sun them out or anything (it doesn't bother us) but I thought I'd mention it.",4
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),"It's sometimes tough to find a bottle a nursing baby will take, but I'm had success with both my kids using this bottle.  I like how it really vents the air, unlike cheap bottles that suck in on themselves as the kids is drinking them.  I also like how the bottom comes off for easy cleaning. You just have to be careful putting the little rubber thing back in the bottom.  If you don't get it just right, it leaks a bit.  This set is a great value and I love the variety of sizes and nipple flows it comes with.  BPA Free -- a definite must in my book.  These and Tommee Tipee's are my go-to bottles (but these come in first place)",5
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","i was a little confused at first on how to put them on, but got it all put together and looks really good.",4
"Evenflo AMP High Back Car Seat Booster, Pink Angles",This seat came quickly and is easy to put together. My son loves it! Great price and I like how it makes into a booster seat.,5
North States Supergate Expandable Swing Gate,"Good gate, easy to use and install. Just what I needed to keep my pooches contained on the deck. The shipment arrived in great time and shape. Very pleased.",4
"Kolcraft Cozy Soft Portable Crib Mattress, Lily","I ordered this for a trip I was taking with my 8 month old baby. He sleeps so well in his crib normally, the pack n play I have to take on trips for him to sleep in has a card board for a mattress. It's pathetic. Anyway, I brought this with me and was very pleased to see how thick and comfy it was. It didn't fit the pack n play perfectly, but I was able to stuff the 2in gap with soft blankets. I was worried he might roll in the crack in the middle of the night and it disturb is sleep, never woke up once!! I'd recommend this to anyone.",5
Sassy Water-Filled Teethers 2 Pack,I am all about cute thing affordable! My baby girl is now just starting to get her little teeth and these work great and for the price you can't go wrong![...],4
"Graco SmartSeat All-in-One Car Seat, Rosin","After my daughter outgrowing her carrier carseat after a mere 6 months, we needed a carseat that was rear facing, but able to contain her ever-growing body.  However, we wanted one where it would be used far longer than 6 months.  Enter the Graco Smartseat.  It has the handy base of the Snugride, but it can be rear-facing, forward facing, and eventually becomes a child booster seat.  This thing is HUGE and heavy.  Sure, the base makes installation easy, but the seat is so heavy that you really don't want to move it back and forth between cars.  But you won't have a flip over on right hand turns because it snaps through the seat belt in addition to the LATCH systems, so you don't have to worry if it's JUST right.  This thing is so heavy that gravity holds it in place anyway.  However, I don't recommend this seat if you have a car smaller than a fullsize sedan.  It's a snug fit in our car, squeezing between our headrests in the front seat.  I recommend trying it out at Babies R Us First before buying to make sure it fits your car.Another bonus is that the adjustment strap that you pull.  Most seats you have to pull down to tighten, but that's almost impossible if the seat is rear-facing since the seats are pushed together.  Not so with this one - you can pull UP.  There is also no rethreading the straps as your child grows.  You extend the back of the seat while it's still in the car.  Sure, it's a pricey seat, but it's one that will last.  You really get $300 of seat.",4
Dapper Snapper Toddler Belt BLACK,"This is an essential piece in my son's wardrobe since so many of his pants do not fit him around his waist.  I've tried finding toddler belts but to no avail.  The dapper snapper stays snapped and because there are multiple grommets, I can adjust the size very easily.  I've had this for over a year from the time my son was 1-1/2 and he's still using it at 3.  What's great is that you do not have to unbuckle a belt in order to change his diaper which would be a problem at his day care.  I highly recommend it and in fact would recommend buying a couple.  You can easily lose one or forget it on a pair of pants that goes to the laundry.",5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue",My son loves his hands to be free so I wrap it under his arm pits. That also gives his legs more room to kick. When my hisband puts it on him he always gets out. I don't know what he does diffrently?? When I use it I never have that problem. I've have this brand and another brand. This one if my favorite. I wish I never bought the regular blankets like at the hospital. I rarely use them now.,5
Aden + Anais Issie Security Blanket Set Declan Elephants,"I bought these blankets because i realized my baby liked feeling cloth against her face before she fell asleep, so I bought these because the material is breathable.  I was afraid that she could choke herself if I got her other thicker blankets.  She loves them.  I bought 2 packets so she would have one in her crib, car seat and at day care.  At first I would let her fall asleep with it and then I would take it away, but now at 6 months, I let her sleep with them in her crib.  We have had no problems.",5
Summerside Activity Table with 2 Drawers - Oak,This train table is very heavy and made of solid wood. It is sure to be durable enough for even the most rambunctious toddlers. I like this table because it can be used as a coffee table as well as an activity table. I bought it when it was only $99 but I feel like it is worth much more than that. The only problem I had was putting together the 2 storage bins. It was short 1 of the allen head bolts. Also the bins don't seem quite as durable as the table itself but for the price the fact that bins were included is amazing! It's not perfect but it's a great choice if you want a versatile table that will last longer than a childs love for trains. My son is a huge train lover (at 3 years old) but I'm sure he will be into legos and other stuff in the near future. My son loved putting all of his trains in the bins so that also might help with learning to keep toys picked up. The price jumped to $199 since I bought it but I'm sure it will drop again soon. So for $99-$120 I would buy it again without question!!,4
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,Love this product.  I have a 14 month old and 3 year old who love them.  I did buy a funnel but found a spoon worked best for me. I will probably buy another set so I can have more ready to go.  They wash nicely and are made well.,5
See Me Smile Infant Mirror Tan Bear,"This was the perfect solution for our problem -- not having a separate headrest.  Most other mirrors require a headrest for installation.  This can be attached to the LATCH tether at the top of the seat.  Also, with the beanbag stabilizer, it doesn't vibrate at all.  Another bonus is that it's incredibly easy and quick to install.  There are a couple of great YouTube videos made by the inventor of the mirror that show how easy it is to install.  If you're on the fence at all, go check those out... they have one video for installing on a head rest and one for cars without a head rest.  I watched both before buying and was pretty sure this would meet our needs, and I'm pleased that it has.  The mirror is big and very clear and easy to see from the front seat.  I would definitely recommend it to other parents who want to keep an eye on their little ones.",5
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","I am in love with Aden + Anais products! These bamboo swaddling wraps are great! They are super soft, and a big enough for multiple use! Yes, they are great for swaddling...but also great for the stroller, tummy time etc. I highly recommend these!",5
"BRICA Day &amp; Night Light Musical Auto Mirror for in Car Safety, Grey","The mirror, if you can get it positioned where you need it, is great.  The light is never bright enough to see your child.  The music isn't so soothing for my baby either.  I had to get creative to get this in a position to see my baby.  The strap on the back is horrible. All you really need is the mirror.",2
"Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefold, White, Size One (6-18 lbs)","Initially, I ordered two of these Thirsties Duo Hemp Prefolds from another website, liked them so much that I ordered two more from Amazon to have 4 total.  After the initial washing (never been used by the baby), I noticed the stitching was not right on one of them (Lot #4140 to be exact).  It appeared to be creating small holes in the cotton, like the stitching was tearing the cotton.  Coincidentally, but truthful, one of the original prefolds (from another website) had done the same thing, same Lot #4140!  I had already done the warranty information for that one, but ordered from Amazon because otherwise, I really liked this prefold (hence 3 stars).  Thirsties is taking care of the first warranty, I just finished contacting them about the second.The hoop design is nice for drying.  Also, line drying doesn't result in as much hard fabric as some of my other prefolds do, I still put in to tumble dry for a bit to soften all my cottons anyway.  If it weren't for the stitching problems (50% are problematic so far), I would've ranked it 5 stars.Maybe they'll figure out the problems, because I'd really love to promote this one!",3
Bearington Baby Pink Wiggles Snuggler,"I was disappointed that the bear was not able to open up flat. my grandchildren need to cover their faces in order to fall asleep, so it does not work.",3
Skip Hop Zoo Playspot,"These tiles look great, but the animals are peeling after only a few months of use. Lovely design, but functionally not good quality. Hopefully there is no toxicity in the paint. Replacing it just in case.",2
Medela Nipple Shield Regular 24mm,"These were a lifesaver for my child (who had a weak suck from birth).  We went 2 weeks without it but she was really struggling to latch & my ability to nurse was being compromised.  A lactation consultant told me that it's better to use one of these if absolutely necessary than to stop nursing from difficulties with latching.She saved us!!  My baby used this for the next 3 weeks or so & then I slowly weaned her off of it with the help of a lactation nurse & MOPS group.  We are still going strong & she's 5 months old.I definitely think people should try their VERY best to go au naturale when it comes to nursing but if you're doing everything you can & it still isn't working, this could be your answer.  Yes, carrying around a Nipple Shield is a pain but if you get help/advice from a nurse you can wean off of this in no time when your baby figures it out.Oh & some babies never develop a great latching ability.  My baby is still a pain & doesn't want to work for her meal....she's just come to realize that her mommy is MUCH more stubborn than her =)  Good luck!",5
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda Playgio Play Yard, Red","Couldn't be happier with my purchase. I was going to go with a more expensive one with the bassinet and toy bar but since my daughter is about 8 mos old, I decided on this. Couldn't be happier. You can't really see the pad on the bottom of the picture but it's completely black and seems like it would hold up for a good amount of time.  It's also way bigger than I expected it to be. Great color and very functional. Super easy to set up. I didn't even really need the directions. All in all a great playard.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"We started with the Diaper Genie as most new parents seem to do for some reason and we hated it!  The new design is jsut as poor as the original!  It's a total pain to empty and change the bags.  And the bag get a bit costly after a while!  And no matter how we spun the thinkg we still ended up with one big bag of nasty diapers...not ""sausage links"" for us!It was a total waste of money!  We returned ours after a couple of weeks and got the Diaper Champ.  We love that thing!  No bags to buy and no stupid spinning!  Save your time money, and sanity...go with a Diaper Champ!",1
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"Our daughter is breastfed, so we wanted bottles with softer nipples. A lot of other brands have nipples that feel very plastic. We have loved this bottles in that our daughter will drink from them--and we've tried about 4 or 5 other nipples--but we hate that they leak. It's like a constant slight drip onto our little girl while she's eating. Unfortunately, after experiencing this, my wife checked online to see if anyone else has had this issue and many other parents have. We can't get them to stop leaking, but we still use them because these are the only nipples our daughter will take.",3
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","There is nothing to keep the baby swaddled (like velcro on the SwaddleMe blankets). It was also huge for our newborn... I can't imagine swaddling a baby large enough to fit in this. And it was $30! It was a complete waste of money, and we have never used it. We ended up getting the SwaddleMe brand as hand-me-downs and LOVE those ones.",1
3ct Diamond Pacifier (278 Pave Set Diamonds),I am SO glad I had three kids! I had to sell my first born to provide this for my third. My second child went blind when the sun caught the diamond at a strange angle but we are Adjusting well. The baby never cries anymore! Sure his head is buried on his chest due to the weight if the object and when he falls asleep with it in his mouth (on his back-clearly!) it is so weighed down into his mouth it NEVER falls out! He can't even flip over in his sleep thanks to the paci! We have been using this since day one and tomorrow he turns five. Thankful we bought this!,4
"Clek Olli Booster Car Seat, Jet",Attached quickly and securely to the latch system in 2004 car. Matches interior well and my son says it is the most comfortable chair he owns.,5
"NUK Orthodontic Silicone BPA Free Nipple Bottle, 5 Ounce, Single Pack, Colors May Vary",Very good if you are  feeding both breastmilk and formula to a new born.  Also helped my son who has very bad colic.,4
"Kids Line Nightlight, Star Blue","I bought this as a gift for a cousin-- the price is cheaper than in Baby R Us, and it's a substantially sized nightlight that's well painted and looks good. I used it as the main gift in a baby basket full of stuff and it looked very good. I'm not sure I'd highly recommend on its own, as I don't think it would go very well with too much other than the entire Dena Happi Tree set, but that's what they are doing their babies nursery in so it was definitely a good buy. It seems kind of heavy, but also sturdy and well made. It was shipped well also-- no damages or problems.All in all, I would definitely recommend it, especially if it's on a gift recipient's registry as you're saving ~$5 and getting a good quality item.",4
"Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green","Initially, I thought this item was kind of silly.  Cute, but impractical. After I got it home, I LOVE IT!  It takes up very little space, but can be packed with a ton of baby bottles, pacifiers, etc. I use the Dr. Brown's bottles and love it for drying all of the many parts and pieces. Very easy to clean. Excellent item!",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"freddy is AWESOME. my son loves this little guy. one of his favorite toys to gnaw at. sometimes he just stares at the black and white patterns on the back of freddy's wings. nowadays he's into the red teething plastic. when we take freddy out, other little kids/babies come and try to snatch him away from our baby. freddy just attracts babies like crazy! luv luv luv this product",5
Koala Baby - Moonbeam 6 Piece Bedding Set,"Adorable!  The bedding is gorgeous and can be used for a boy or a girl. The bedding also has a lot of accessories for the nursery.  We have the lamp, wall hangings and pillow. The colors are great and the bedding is very soft.  I originally did not like the bedding when I viewed it online, but when I saw it in the store I knew that this was it!",5
"Joovy Room&sup2; Portable Playard, Red",this his perfect. My son is 9 months old but is as big as most 1 year olds. this play pen is the perfect size for him and his toys!!  He takes his naps in there and is very comfortable.  It collapses easy once you get the hang of it and is very portable from room to room.  Its kind of heavy so I dont think I'll be transporting it anywhere outside of my home but its great so far!,5
Z. Daisy Chandler Camo Binkie Bungee Pacifier Clip,Perfect! It's light weight and soft. So cute! The elastic has lasted longer than I expected. Still using after 2 years.,5
Tiddliwinks Sweet Safari Fitted Sheet in White/Pink,Purchased this for my new granddaughter's crib.  It was just what we expected.I would recommend this for a sweet little girl.,4
Wimmer-Ferguson Clip and Discover Shapes Take Along Toys,What can I say? This one has been a hit since she was maybe 4 or 5 weeks old. She's now 4 months and still gets a kick out of these great take-along toys. She has had whole conversations with the cat and the baby while staring at them intently making a whole range of facial expressions.,5
Squatty Potty 7&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"I was very doubtful, but the Squatty Potty make the &#34;going&#34; better - more complete. It allowes your body to do what it does naturally.",5
Bright Starts Grab and Stack Blocks,"My son seems to like these blocks. They are bright, big and soft, which is perfect for my 4 month old.",5
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue",This product is like a built in babysitter. My grandaughter who is 7 months loves it! She will stay in it for an hour at a time. The quality is great and the price on amazon can't be beat.,5
"Britax B-Safe Base Kit, Black",Bought this for my car so that my wife and i can alternate taking and picking up our child from day care.Works just like the one that comes with the b-safe car seat. No complaints!,5
"Itzy Ritzy Infant Car Seat Cover, Urban Jungle Blue","This item is NOT allowed by any manufacturer. They all void the warranty. Anything that goes between the baby and the straps, other than light clothing, is dangerous. It can cause compression and eject your baby from the seat. Also, if your car or a car that hit you were to catch fire this seat will not protect the baby. It meets no federal safety requirements and could be a matter of life and death for your child. Please use your brain and do not use these!",1
"Mommy's Helper Step Up Non-Slip Stepstool Froggie Collection, Green",Stays in place well and my 16 month old has no problem stepping up on it or using it as a seat.  Lightweight enough that she can move it on her own.,5
MEG Original Minky Dot Baby Blanket Gray/White,I love the modern design. (I have been looking for anything grey/black/white to match with my stroller & carseat). Love the quality fabric as well.,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"Although my baby likes being in the Jumperoo, she does not love it like she does herGraco Baby Einstein Discover & Play Activity Center. The Activity Center is still her favorite probably due to the variety of toys all around. She's not so excited by the toys on the jumper. A funny side effect of spending time in the Jumperoo is that when she's not in it, she still tries to jump including while she is sitting... So she bobs her head up and down as if jumping and it looks like she's jamming to a cool song :-)",4
"Eddie Bauer Harness, Girl Monkey","I'm a mom of 20 months old boy/girl twins.  Bought this Monkey (for my daughter) and the Bear (for my son) for our first international trip to China.  They were used quite a bit at the airport and other public places throughout our trip.  Since my twins were still a bit young and didn't walk with a sense of direction, they fought against the leash and fell often.  But my husband and I were at least able to contain them within reach.  Once they're a bit older, I believe they will be even more useful!  My twins love walking around wearing the monkey and the bear once I tug the leash in the pocket.  A must have for twin parents to travel!",5
Combi Cosmo DX Lightweight Stroller in Malibu,"This stroller is great for our small car. It's very light and easy to fold. At first, we're not sure how to fold it, so we went to YouTube for video instruction. It's super easy. The adjustable reclining design is great. Our baby can sleep in there, very comfortable! And we love the color!",4
"Luvable Friends Infant Pillow Case, Traditional Blue Print","Nice soft pillowcase for the price. I am ordering our third one so that should tell you something. The only complaint I have is that because this is made of a knit fabric, it does not remain rectangular. My son stretches it all out while sleeping and it ends up completely twisted (with seams ending up partially in middle of the pillow.. you get the idea). Oh, and washing/drying the cases doesn't restore their shape. They remain forever twisted. This does not affect functionality, it's just less than tidy looking.UPDATE - It's several months later and all three of these cases have not held up well to normal toddler use and washing.  None of them are rectangular; You can't even fold them.  Since they are all stretched out and askew, they shift around during the night.  My son then gets frustrated with them and takes them off.  This means the actual pillow is getting drooled on night after night and needs to be washed often.  Now the pillow stuffing is lumpy and I'm back online buying a memory foam travel pillow.  I was thinking maybe if these cases had velcro, a zipper or snaps to close off the open end, this might solve our problem of him removing the cases constantly.  I'd add buttons, but I'm afraid of the choking hazard.  Anyway, it really should be this difficult to cover a pillow, right?I initially really liked these because they were a great bargain and were inexpensive.  However, these are not worth the hassle after they get stretched out and twisted.  I'm reducing to two stars.",2
"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer","What can I say? It's cute, shipped fast, tells me the temperature of the water and entertains my son! It makes prepping his bath much easier and faster in the evenings",5
"green sprouts Warming Plate, Sage","I wish I had found this product sooner. My son was already well into self-feeding and finger foods when I purchased a few of these, but I got them primarily because we have no microwave. I have tried all sorts of other ways to re-heat his food, and this is probably the most convenient and simple way I have found so far. I heat water in my kettle, and--very carefully--pour it through the very tiny opening in this plate. Liquid food heats up quickly, though finger foods need more stirring and time.I do wish the opening were larger. But it's not the end of the world.I bet if I had this plate when my son was just starting out on solids, I would have used it all the time.",4
"Ju-Ju-Be Fuel Cell Insulated Bag, Black/Silver","Cute print, very good quality, excellent features, a lot bigger than I needed. Takes up too much room in the diaper bag. Probably better if used for a lunch box versus a bottle cooler.",4

BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,Our little girl LOVES this potty and is so comfortable on it sometimes she doesn't want to get off.  I highly recommend.,5
The First Years Swing Tray - Portable Booster Seat Blue &amp; Aqua,"I bought this for my 2 year old who wants to sit at the big boy table.  It lasted 2 weeks of him taking the back off and sliding the seat part half off.  I did not use the tray so the hole to hold the tray was left open.  Needless to say that is where he stashed crumbs.  I really like the design and the ease of the straps, but it falls apart to easiely.  I think I am going to buy the Fold & Go Booster from Safety First.",2
Little Partners Learning Tower - Natural,"I was reluctant to but the learning tower because of the price.  However, the reviews I read here and elsewhere convinced me to go ahead and get it.  I have not been disappointed.  It is well made, sturdy and makes time in the kitchen so more more fun for both me and my child.",5
Chicco Lil Piano Splash Walker,"Our baby was four months old when we purchased the walker. Even though only two toes touched the floor, he was still able to scoot around and enjoy the music and lights. The entertainment board (&#34;piano&#34;) offers a variety of colors, sounds, and activities. I highly recommend this product.",5
Kolcraft Pure Sleep Therapeutic 150 Crib Mattress,It is good for the price.  You get what you pay for with mattresses.  We plan on having it for a long time so I wish I had spent a little more for one that fits the crib better.  Slight rounding where it meets the corners.,3
"Skip Hop Zoo Storage Bins, Ladybug",This is perfect for organizing toys. It fit inside my kids' toy box. I also used one outside the toy box. Too cute!,5
Sassy 12 Count Disposable Changing Pads,I didn't realize that these are rather small. I bought them when I travelled internationally with my 6 month old and he was  rather big for them. So ended up only being under his bum as opposed to his whole body which I would have liked,4
Sophia Mini Siderail Toddler Bed Conversion Kit Finish: Espresso,"All the questions were about how I liked this toy and its educational value. It's not a toy, it's a bed rail for a crib. It's not educational, it's, once again, a bed rail.It fits the sorelle sophia crib perfectly (the one made in china with the metal under the mattress) and was easy to put together. Thanks!",5
"NUK Reusable Nursing Pads, 6 Pack","DONT waste your money1- they are WAY too small for any nursing mom2- they are too stiff and won't sit right in any bra3- they are itchy, rough and uncomfortable4- they don't absorb more than a teaspoon before you need a changeI would give these pads a zero if I could!",1
Nuby 7 oz. Cup With Valveless No-Spill Spout,"My 13-month old ends up covered with milk every time she uses this cup.  After the first few times using it, she figured out that you can press on the top and the milk will come out the sides.  The top also does not stay in place, so the valve is always off center.  This is the only sippy cup I have ever just thrown in the garbage...",1
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"Stay clear of this bathtub... I cleaned mine and in all of the crevises, MOLD had started top grow. The suction cups are so tight that if you fill up the tub and try to move it, you cannot lift it up. You have to take this tub apart every other day to keep it clean and safe for your child. My daughter also has a hard time laying on the mat. She keeps sliding down and I have to keep picking her back up. Buy a different bathtub for your child.........VERY DANGEROUS",1

Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,I had a six hour lay over at the airport with my two and a half year old son.  This strap was perfect for my trip.  He loved riding and seeing everything and he even took his nap while being strolled in his own car seat.  This was a simple yet wonderful invention.,5
"The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup, Disney Princess","Easy to hold on to, grandson loves the characters because he loves the movies. These are his favorite cups he's 2 1/2years old.",5
"Moby Wrap UV SPF 50+ 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Sand","My baby loves to be held in the Moby Wrap.  It was particularly useful in the early months, when she was not comfortable in a ""baby bjorn""-style carrier.  She slept in it really well, probably because she was held so tightly against me.  She is now old enough to alternate between this and a ""baby bjorn""-type carrier.  The carrier is great for when I want her awake and alert, but the Moby Wrap is good for longer wearings, when I want her to nap.Practical tips:1.  There's a lot of wrapping required, but you get the gist of it quickly.2.  It fits me fine (5'4"", 130 lbs), but my husband is 6'2"", 200 lbs, and the ends of it barely tie for him.3.  Put it on before you get in the car (without the baby of course), as you don't want to be wrapping yourself in a dirty parking lot.  It is very long and the ends drag on the ground as you are performing ""the wrap.""4.  The fabric is a kind of jersey knit, which is very warm.  This might not be comfortable in the middle of summer or a very warm climate.5.  It shrinks a little in the dryer, but seems to stretch right back out to its previous size once you put it on and stick a baby in it.6.  Moby gives instructions on how to make your own Moby Wrap from your own fabric if you don't want to purchase their product.  But you know what?  For the amount of fabric I'd have to buy, this price is really not bad.  Plus, this version has a pretty little modern design on it that makes it fun to wear.Overall, I can say I've gotten my money's worth out of this item.  There are other baby items I've purchased for a similar price and not used nearly as much.  I'm glad I bought this!",5
Baptismal Shell Brass,"Make sure that you are purchasing the all-brass baptismal shell, and not the white ceramic one with a gold cross glued into it.  There is a seller who seems to have latched the listing for their ceramic product onto this listing by mistake.  Regarding the brass baptismal shell, it is of excellent quality, and comparable to other shells available at double the price.  It has three ball-feet so that it can stand level, and is solid brass --not plated-- and has the fine weight of a brass product.",5
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe Adjustable Infant Wrap, 3-Pack, Mom &amp; Baby","I bought this 3 pack because it was cheaper than buying them individually. I have a 12 month old and a newborn. Both boys. My 12 month old loved being in these straight jackets. I bought these hoping the newborn would like them too. Yup, he does. It helps him sleep and gives him the feeling he's still in the womb. I recommend these to all newborn babies.",5
Pair of Panda Baby Booties Foot Rattles,Go with a different brand.  I ordered these and one of the socks was missing a rattle?!?! Now I can't use them!  You think this would have been caught in the packaging. Very disappointed.,1
Munchkin Cleaning Brush Set,I use this to clean my toddler bottles. I love all the different sizes; useful for cleaning bottles and my breast pumping accessories.,5
Prince Lionheart Stroller Gate Check Bag,"We have two strollers, one of which is the Britax B Agile and the other is a Stokke Xplory.  I hoped this universal bag would fit both, but it didn't fit the B Agile.  Since that's our go-to stroller for travel, I needed to return this and buy the Britax brand one specifically designed for our stroller.  We have the Lionheart carseat bag, though, which matches this bag, and we like the carseat bag just fine.",3
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn","Good thing for a newborn. My daughter just sleeps in it through the night and can't get her hands out, which means no wake-ups. Plus it is soft and warm. I wish Halo has the bigger size with swaddle feature as well.",5
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange","I absolutely love this stroller!!! I did a crazy amount of research before deciding on this model. I was also considering the versa, but the gt won because of its size. We have a decent sized apartment and a small car. This folds in and out of them like a breeze! If we have another child we'll reconsider the versa, but every review I saw said how it folds bigger and is heavier.If you're considering a city mini, spring for the gt model. My friend has the standard model and wishes she had the gt for the tires, and handlebar. They both handle like a dream, though.",5
"Skip Hop Set of 2 Zoo Bookends, Dog","Since I read other reviews I knew this would not be a good bookend, but i still wanted it so I finally decided to buy. This was bigger than I thought. It's about 7.5 inch. I love how cute this owl is! Looks great in my nursery room! Cute decor item, not so good bookend.",5
"Gund Baby Lena Lamb Musical Toy, Jesus Loves Me",The item did not work as discribed so I returned for a refund. I would not buy this product again.,1

"Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake, Year-Round",o I never write reviews but feel I must on this product.  My husband and I have purchase MANY products trying to capture our infants hand and foot prints including lots of different ink products on the market and other impression material.  This stuff is AWESOME!Some pointers I recommend: You MUST knead the material for 2-3 minutes as directed.  I used books on either end when rolling it out to make it perfectly even and a marble rolling pin (don't even bother with the one in the kit).  When you roll it out roll only in one direction to help keep it from sticking to the rolling pin. When you make the impression I put Johnson and Johnson baby lotion on the hand and foot first to keep it from sticking to the material (make sure you apply enough)!  The best part is even if you mess up you can re-roll the material as many times as you need (we did about 6-7x for the hand print!)  About 12 hours into the drying process peel it off the tin foil and flip it over for the other 12 hours to dry (and keep it from curving in).  If you use your material wisely you actually have enough to make a hand and foot print from the package.  I also managed to turn the frame right side up and put both the hand and foot print in the designated spot along with our infants picture.  It looks AMAZING and Pearhead is wonderful to work with!!If the product does not come out of the package difficultly (sticking to the sides) then it's probably no good.  (I bought 6 ornament impression kits as well and they were drier and made awful prints.  I called the company and they sent me out 6 replacements for FREE)!  They also did that for the ink kit we bought that didn't work out as well.  This company is awesome..can't rave about them enough!  o I never write reviews but feel I must on this product.

Child Airplane Travel Harness - Cares Safety Restraint System - The Only FAA Approved Child Flying Safety Device,"After looking at user reviews on several sites, I purchased this airplane restraint for my four year old daughter, who weighs 38 pounds. Unfortunately, we were not able to test the product in flight because once I unpacked it, I read in the package inserts that there is a height limit of 40 inches (which my daughter exceeds). I reviewed the manufacturer's website as well as Amazon's and never saw anything about an upper height limit. The return process was fast and painless and the product did arrive prior to estimated date of receipt.",3
"Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, Yellow","We own two of them.  We use these CONSTANTLY as we go out.  They are the biggest lifesavers when we go out to eat.  They are easy to pack up as they fold up really nicely in themselves, they are very, very durable, they don't stain (easily), and they clean up really nice.  They are just spectacular.  We've bought more for a few shower gifts for people, telling them that this is one of those things you won't realize that you need until you have kids and then use it.  Everyone we've given it to loves them, too.",5
"green sprouts 10 Pack Waterproof Absorbent Terry Bibs, Girls","This is a good value of bibs in so many colors for the price.  The problem is I'm already having trouble getting them all the way around my newborns neck.  I can still get them on by just the tips of the velcro now so I know they aren't going to last us much longer.  I wish I would not have bought these now because I'm going to have to turn right around and buy another set.  Additionally, they are not very soft and I don't even like wiping under her mouth with it because it seems like it would be too rough on her skin.  Personally, I wouldn't want them rubbed on my skin.  It is true that liquid does not go through to the clothes and they do not make that crinkly sound of some waterproof bibs so that is nice.  If only the neck straps were longer it would be a great product.Also, you might think you'll be able to match these to a lot of outfits, but my little girl does not have all of those wild colors in her wardrobe so they clash.  I just have to reserve the light pink and white bibs for when we take her out of the house so she matches.",3
"HALO Early Walker SleepSack Lightweight Knit Wearable Blanket, Blue, Large",Keeps my son nice and warm.  He moves all around his crib at night and I was afraid to use blankets.,5
"Munchkin Mighty Grip Trainer Cup 2-Pack, 8 oz, Colors Vary",These sippy cups are very hard to come by where I live. I bought them for my son when he was learning how to drink from a cup. I like the fact that they are smaller than most sippy cups (meaning they hold less). Which worked well for us as he didn't drink much to being with. The soft spout which the child controls and great for starting out. My one complain is that once the get a bit older and realize the soft spout disperses the liquid everywhere if you push it onto your high chair tray. Made for a bit of a mess. I would definitely recommend this cup for babies just starting out with a sippy. cup.,4
Munchkin Baby Laundry Bag,"Great idea, very well made. I keep it fastened to my daughter's changing table. I just wish it was a bit bigger. Fills up pretty quick. I use it as more of a laundry hamper than a laundry bag. This idea saves some space!",4
Green Sprouts I Play 2-Pack Pacifiers 0-6 months BPA Free - Pink/Green,"These were perfect because they went with the theme of my niece's nursery, but unfortunately she never took a pacifier. :(",5
"Kushies &quot;On the Go&quot; 2 Pack Wet Bag, Green  (Patterns and Colors May Vary)","These were okay bags- at first. The size is very good for travel, the colors are cute, and it doesn't smell.However- if you leave wet cloth diapers in them for more than a couple hours, it begins to seep wetness all over the bag.But these bags do not hold up. After 8 months of very gentle use (I don't use them more than once or twice a month, and never put them in the dryer) the drawstring hasn't closed without a struggle for ages, the colors have faded a little, and the inner plastic lining is coming off in the wash.If you need a good wet bag, either spend the extra $$ for a better quality bag- or do what I and my friends do now and just use a plastic grocery bag, it works better and its cheap as free!",1
Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobile,"This is a really nice little mobile and attaches/moves easily but is still sturdy. For our little one in particular the issue was she always wanted to get to the little animals... until it got to the point where she was tall enough to rip them off. Even 10 months after animal removal these little guys are still some of her favorites (especially the giraffe which we have to wash often as the feet seem to be the ultimate teethers for front, canines and molars). It has nice melodies and a very soft light if you choose that option. Battery life is middle of the road.",5
Especially for Baby Steam Sterilizer,The sterilizer is hard to use with Dr Brown bottles b/c of the height of the bottles. I have to do the bottles and nipples separately and it tends to leak a lot of water.,2

"Nuby 2 Pack Nurtur Care Infa Feeder Set, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary",I looked for these in every store and finally found them on here after I was told they dont even make them anymore. They got here sooner than anticipated.  They were in perfect condition. They cost more than I expected them to but they were so worth it.,5
Boppy Water Resistant Protective Cover,"First of all, the cover fits the Boppy well. It's snug and durable. But unfortunately it doesn't protect the Boppy from liquids any more than any other cover. I tried using it by itself and pee got through without any problems. Then I added an additional cover over it and spitup got through both covers. It's cheaper than some other covers, so on this aspect, it's worth it. But don't get it expecting it to protect the Boppy from any inevitable baby wetness related problems.",3
Maymom Tubing Set For Medela Freestyle Breastpump,"Like others, I was suspicious if the tubing will fit my free style breast pump because of some negative reviews on this product. I decided to give it a try since I have amazon prime (two-way free shipping).I received the package within two days and I have been using it since then.  No problem whatsoever.  I could do double and single pumping with the little part it included.  I also tried just keeping the other side plugged in to do single pumping - it worked as well.Happy with the purchase, and saved me $$.  Two thumbs up. No need to return.",5
Green Chambray Folding Hamper,"The review by Janine Flood took the words right out of my mouth!  I washed this in cold also.  I don't remember now, but I may have even air dried it.  If I did dry it, it was on low heat.  It shrank so much, I can only get the velcro to reach around the wood frame on one side a tiny bit with much effort.  It's enough to hold it on though.  I've managed to use it for 7 months so far and I do like it alot.  The mesh bag is great.  I keep the cloth top flipped open unless I have company.  It would be a pain to have a seperate cover to open each time or leave lying around.",3

"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","got this gate last night, opened up the box and had it installed in my 2y.o's doorway in 15 min(and that's because i'm a slow reader). very easy to use, should keep my kid in her room so that when she wakes up in the morning, she wont leave her room and tumble down the stairs.  seems to be fairly tight in the doorway, but this gate also comes with these caps, that you can screw into your door jamb for more security than just pressure.so far so good.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Extra Wide Walk Thru Gate, White","We needed a baby gate and this one fit the bill in terms of length and quality. You need to buy the extentions based on how wide of base you have, but most of the different products out there require a base because they dont build them very wide. Our son loves to stand up against the gate and pull at it. So far, he has not been able to pull it over or get through. You get your money's worth and definitely the best one for the price. Others recommended this one and I will agree with them.",4
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","I went back and forth about this one and the Britax frontier.  I have the Britax Marathon for my son already.  It's a great seat for the $$ I really, really mean that but we are taking a chance with the buckle as it is a good 2"" shorter then the Britax as I went to the store to measure.  I went as far as emailing Graco to see if they had any plans to change it and suggested the googled their own product to see their ONE MAJOR FLAW!  Anyway long and short my 95% sized 4.5 year old fits FINE in it NOW but could be an issue in the future.  I moved him from the Marathon to this and my 2 year old to the Frontier and all are happy.  On a good note I love the cup holders and nooks to put toys.  I can't wait to turn it into the next stages vs buying a new seat and if you all wait you will find this seat on sale for $130 or less!  Target, Amazon and a few others will have sales on this seat so just keep looking.  Hope this helps as all the reviews I read before this DID!  Good luck!",4
"Kiddopotamus Cradler Adjustable Head Support for Newborns to Toddlers, Ivory Teddy Bears",Not a good fit for car seats. Causes child's head to be rigidly held in one position and makes her very uncomfortable. If the inside had been softer it might work better.,2
Philips Avent 6 Pack BPA Free Classic Variable Flow Nipple,"It was as the description said... my baby love it and the quality is good, in the box is 3 nipple by package",5
(1) Buckle Guard Car Seat Belt Button Cover in BLACK,"Very simple to use and works great on side button seat belt locks,  Top button locks are a little more difficult because the cover has to be removed to access the button.  Not a big deal, but taking it on and off will probably wear out the plastic hinge.",4
"Carter's Forest Friends Musical Mobile, Tan/Choc","It matches to room decor, but it stopped working in less than 30 days!The music plays for too little time.I don't recommend it at all, really disappointing.",1
"Baby Aspen Big Dreamzzz Baby Ballerina Layette Set with Gift Box, Pink",Bought it for my granddaughter 8 weeks old but she won't be wearing it for several months.  Ok quality and look forward to seeing it on her.,4
"Sugarbooger Children's Closet Dividers, Pink Dot",So cute!  Fits on the closet clothing bars well.,5
Carter's Cuddle-Me Fleece Blanket - Pink Dot,My granddaughter's blankie at MawMaw's house.  Durable and comes out of the dryer looking like new.  Would definitely purchase again.,5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Happy Giraffe Bouncer,"We received this as a gift for our baby, and she has loved it ever since I put her in it at about 1.5 months.  It's been fun to watch her figure out that the bouncer moves when she moves, and more recently that she can make the toys rattle when she bats at or grabs onto them.  She is big for her age (4 months) and still fits comfortably in it.Pros:  This item is easy to put together and take apart for transporting and it is lightweight, making it very portable.  It's also pretty sturdy and has a ""harness"" strap so I feel comfortable leaving the baby in it.  We set it down wherever we are and it usually occupies the little one for 20-30 min, or maybe more if she chooses to take a nap in it.  The toy bar is removable so you can use it like a little seat if you want.  There is also a vibrating function, though I have not used this personally.  The biggest pro is that our baby seems to love it, and it is one of the more reasonably priced bouncers with all of the basic functions.Cons:  The base is made of metal rods that curve around, but the problem is that they are wider than the bouncer itself (in the photo it's where the green rubber covers the white metal rods) so we, and anyone else who visits, are constantly tripping over the bouncer if we're not careful.  The worst is when we get the metal part caught between our toes and then trip - I honestly thought I broke my toes a few times... ouch!  It seems that a solid base design or at least some panels to cover the sides would be much safer since I'm not about to put this on an elevated surface to avoid tripping over it.  Another small con is that the middle ring plays sounds when you pull on it, but one of the four sound cycles is a little useless, and sounds kind of like very low growling (other sounds include a ""meow"", and 2 MIDI-sounding tunes).  Not a big deal, but I could do without it personally.Overall I would recommend this bouncer over some of the pricier models unless you are pressed for space and can't put it somewhere where it won't be a safety hazard!",4
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver",We have 2 cars and this was perfect so that we didn't have to keep taking the base out and putting it in the other vehicle.,5
36 Pc Full Size Diaper Pins,Ordered these for decorations at a baby shower.  Was so cute. Folded napkins like diapers and used these pins. Then filled the diapers with nuts and mints.  The &#34;mom&#34; got to take them with her.,5
Maxboost Fusion Snap-on iPhone 5S/5 Case - Navy Blue (Fit Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5S/5),"I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation.Overall its a nice case for the money. Its very slim and sleek and fits the iphone like a glove. It doesn't add weight or size to the phone, like other cases do. So if you want some basic protection without adding bulk, this is the case for you. Combine this with a screen protector and you'll be protected against basic scratches from daily use. However, like most cases, this case probably won't protect your phone from a drop onto the sidewalk so just got to be careful!",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This is the best gate. I first got ""Summer Infant Sure and Secure Extra Tall"" because of some of the negative feedbacks.But when I needed another door gate, I took a chance with so many positive feedbacks.and... yes, I really like this gate. If you know how to install properly, it should be pretty firm gate.The other gate is little hard to open for my wife and mom.But this is way to go!!!",5
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella","I like this car seat; we have another Evenflo but got a second car seat for emergencies.I do have two complaints, if you will, about this particular model, though.  First, it's a tad bit difficult to snap in the bottom buckle that goes between their legs because it has to be clicked in perfectly straight.  Not the best when you're on the go, but isn't too big of a deal.The greater of the two complaints would be that the straps definitely dig into my two year old's neck.  So, we bought some little monkey protector things that velcro on around that part of the strap.  I would recommend these.",4
"Ulubulu Universal Pacifier Clip, Oliver Owl",,5
Carter's Child of Mine Mommy's Sweetheart Pink Bear Security Lovey Blanket,I bought this for my daughter when she was 7 weeks old because she was pulling her covers over her head. This was the perfect solution. She got her snuggles and I didn't worry about her suffocating.,5
Maxboost Fusion Snap-on iPhone 5S/5 Case - Navy Blue (Fit Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5S/5),"I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation, it's great quality, it's easy to install and to remove, i might buy one in a different color",5
Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper,"One day our little one started getting bruises all over the house and I went nuts buying safety bumpers.  This one was seemingly a bit pricey, and I didn't know how effective it would be but has ended up being one of my favorite purchases.  Can't tell you how many times this bumper guard has saved the head/face from a nasty bruise.  Worth it--especially if your kid ends up being super active! Was on craigslist and no one sells this stuff 2nd hand, probably b/c they give it to good friends/family instead!  BUY IT.  You won't regret it!",5
Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack,"Used it all away until we ""went away"" with bottles. Like the use, little space it took and the bring color. Would recommend it.",5
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx","We have been using the Britax for our baby for a couple of months now with no problems.  Like the look and feel and our baby seems to be comfortable in it.  The one issue I do have is the fact that if installed in some cars, you need something (they suggest on their YouTube videos a rolled towel or floatie) to help the seat come to a level position.  Since Britax is suppose to be one of the safest car seats around, I would have expected them to have some mistake proofing built into their design or included with the seat to ensure proper installation instead of requiring customers to identify an additional item to obtain the correct position.  I luckily didnt have an issue in my car, but now know of others who have.",4
"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","Cons: Its a very, very large seat; Must use two hands to adjust the bar.PROS: The 5 pt harness was really spaced well; The Latch system was EXTREMELY easy to use; The belt system was EXTREMELY easy to use; The material is easy to clean;",5
Munchkin Fire Ducky Spout Guard,"I don't have this model, but the one with the blue bubble shower cap, and it doesn't seem to matter when reading the other reviews of this model because the mildew problem is still the same!  What were these manufacturers thinking?!  The design leaves MANY crevices where mold develops (under the flip top, the spout area, in and around the inside..).  I have to clean it out every week if that, and even then, some of the crevices are too small for even a toothbrush to reach, so now I will have to resort to soaking it in a diluted bleach solution.The only positive to say about this spout guard is that, yes, it does protect your child from bumping his head, but when they're toddlers, you will cringe to see them try to drink water out of the flip top and suck on it if there is MILDEW growing on the duck!  All in all, this is a horrible product!",2
Snuggy Baby Large Wet Bag - Floral Fireworks,"This bag is a permanent resident in my diaper bag. It's the ideal place to keep messy bibs, wet clothes, cloth diapers, etc. away from everything else in there until I can get them home and into the wash. I think this bag's XL size would make it perfect for long trips, too, and/or moms with more than one child. The exterior fabric is so cute and unique; I like that other moms I know probably wouldn't have a similar bag. The interior is a waterproof lining that's not bulky. The biggest plus, though, is that it's well-constructed and seems really durable, with a smooth zipper and a handy little handle. I definitely recommend it!",5
"Carter's Forest Friends Hamper, Tan/Choc, 17 X 16 X 27&quot;",I love this hamper and it matches our Carter's Forest Friends Crib set perfectly!  Very sturdy and well made.  I would recommend this to anyone needing a dirty clothes hamper who purchased this particular crib set.  The colors matched true to those that appeared on my Mac Book Pro screen.,4
"Athena Nadia 3 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry",The crib is very well made and beautiful...I was surprised that it seemed lighter than other furniture with the same espresso finish but still loved it and would recommend!,5
Houdini Stop Car Seat Chest Clip,"I purchase the Houdini strap so my 20 month boy would stay safely buckled in his car seat. It works perfectly! If your child pushes the harness buckle down towards the waist instead of leaving it closer to the chest area, this is the perfect item to buy. My son is once again strapped in safely - with his arms behind the harness!",5
Gerber Graduates Kiddy Cutlery 3 Piece Fork Set,"I was worried about starting my child too early on metal cutlery, but starting at about 15 months we gave these a try and my little girl loved it!  She needed help with it of course, but the fat handles were great for her to hold onto, and the metal tines were much more effective at spearing food than any plastic fork.  Now at 18 months, we have to make sure all of her food is fork-friendly because she takes such pride in spearing her own food and feeding herself.  Bonus for me - her hands are always clean now!",5
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink","We have a very modern home and this didn't fit any of the three faucets we tried it on. Would have cost us more to return than it was worth, so we ended up giving it to a friend with an older home & she loves it.",2
"AppleCheeks Washable Swim Diaper (Size 2, Mojito)",This diaper works great. It is easy to use and does the job.  Even the blue one is kind of girly looking.,5
Infantino Wonder Whale Kicks and Giggles Gym,"I bought this for my son to go with his nautical-themed nursery. It is really adorable, but the part where you hang the toys is very unstable. If you hang more than one toy from it, it droops down so low it almost touches the mat. It's not really ideal for a small baby. We just hang one toy from it and use the other attachment hooks throughout the bottom, but the advertising is a bit misleading since they hang all four toys with no issue.",3
Cuisinart BFM-1000 Baby Food Maker and Bottle Warmer,"Use it everyday, my baby love the food.  Very easy to use, I totally recommend it. I love this product.",5

'The Insulated Sippy' by Eco Vessel Insulated Stainless Steel Sippy Cup - 10 Oz - Hudson Blue - 10 oz - Container,"I love this sippy cup, & my son loves his new cup, We had this sippy for a week now, Unfortunately this  cup  ""Drips"" out liquid, Which is why it is 3star, But other then that so far  works great & it is the best on the market that I can find..  & The Handles Don't always line up right.. This Sippy easily could be 100stars:}, if Eco Vessels will put a mark on their cups for the lid & does something for the Drip leaks...  super Close to perfect & I am ordering 2nd one today..",3
"Maclaren Quest Sport Stroller, Black/Champagne","After my lightweight (11 lbs) Cybex gave in to NYC Streets and beatings from gateside plane checks, we needed a new umbrella stroller.I narrowed my search down to the MacClaran Quest, UppaBaby G-Luxe and Bumbleride Flite.Very happy with the Quest.  Easy fold & unfold, loads of room for my 2 year old, one hand recline is awesome.  Although not the lightest (13.1 vs. the 9.0 Volo), I LOVE the full recline - worth the extra few pounds to me.  My husband also thinks it is east to use.I live in NYC and have little space and time to fold/unfold/store and get my daughter in/out with bags/briefcase/groceries in hand.  Even if you live in suburbia, I think this is a perfect combo of larger strollers and umbrella strollers.More info for the detail-oriented readers:--Sturdier than UppaBaby G-Luxe.--G-Luxe harder to fold and has two hand, string recline.  Bulky seat padding makes it cumbersome.--Easiest umbrella stroller to navigate one-handed.  Not as easy as my large Teutonia, but better than other brands in its class.--Some people think the Quest five-point harness is too hard to undo.  For my crafty toddler, I rest assured she cannot undo the buckle.  Sure, it's an extra 3-5 seconds to undo it, but worth the peace of mind for me.--I could not find a retailer in a 75 mile radius who carried the Bumbleride Flite and went on YouTube to find demo videos.  Although it is sleek and has a few features more than the Quest (larger canopy and easier buckle), it still did not seem as user friendly as the Quest.--Downside of Quest is the canopy.  Even open, it is not large and does not shift down/adjust like my Cybex.  Personally, I was willing to concede on this for the full recline.  I can use a muslin receiving blanket or add-on canopy for sunny days.--The Quest wheels cannot lock when in fold position, so storing against a wall is hard (not an issue if you have more space), but I do not mind this for the features it affords my daughter.Happy stroller hunting!",5
Carter's Baby Boy's 2-Pack Gowns - Elephants - Newborn,"So, this is my first baby and I purchased a number of brands of newborn and 3 month clothing to see what he would like once he was home.  So far, Carters has been a favorite for him and for me.  Their clothing is soft, washes well and is easy to get on and off.  So, when I was advised to try gowns for night sleep because of their ease come mid-night diaper changes, I thought Carters would be ideal.  Unfortunately, I was wrong.  The base of the gown where the elastic is located is SO tight!!!  Even sliding it up over a newborns legs was difficult and while I was changing his diaper the elastic was cutting off circulation in his waist.  I tried it one night and then both the gowns went into the donation bin.",2
"Ah Goo Baby The Diaper Pouch, Zoo Frenzy","This is so cute and functional, however the velcro that secures the flap is sewn on one way on horizontally on the bag and vertically on the flap, so it doesn't secure well and I've had it come open and things fall out :(. I think this may have just been a mistake when made, and if not for that huge inconvenience, I would have given it 5 stars.",3
"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black",I recently got a new car and didn't want to mess up my seats with my girl's car seats.  In the past I had just used a towel to try to keep my seats looking nice.  These are SO MUCH BETTER!!  They are easy to install and really help cover my seats.  I like the &#34;lip&#34; edge on them that keeps snacks from getting everywhere.  Such a great purchase I'll be buying 2 more for my husband's new truck!,5

Playtex Sip Ease Replacement Valve - 2 Pk,I searched everywhere for these valves because my daughter liked to lose them... Super cheap and exactly what I needed!,5
"Jaq Jaq Bird Perfect Pouch Storage Bag, Roadway, Small, 2 Pack","These bags are handy. They are very cute and the big one is nice and large. I use them to keep clean, dry clothes in my diaper bag. Then when an outfit gets wet and messy I switch them out. The only thing to note is that they are stiff bags - not soft and easily bendable / foldable. This isn't necessarily a drawback but I just wasn't expecting it. They would work particularly well for flat items....or game pieces, markers etc. I also sometimes use them to toss in an ice pack and a snack.",5
Toy Story Toddler Sheet Set -2 Piece,my kids love toy story and were very excited to receive this bed set quickly and well packaged will order more,5
"Dreambaby Bump Belt, Black","This only worked so-so for me. Since I'm petite and very skinny, the elastic tabs that hold the belt down, away from the stomachare too long and loose for me. They do move the belt a bit lower down, but not enough.",3
Summer Infant Sure And Secure Expansion Gate,"I am surprised on all these bad reviews that I am reading.I have owned this gate for 3 years now, bought it in December 2003 when we had our first kid. We have a long and wide staircase and my wife was way too freaked out to even deliver without a gate installed.I remember researching for over a month which gate to get - and which would fit. I decided on this one.3 years later, I would buy it again. True, the template included is not too accurate. But then I am quite handy and I never trust templates.Also, you DO have to measure and install this on the dot so that there's no play on the top or bottom of the hinges.I mounted mine ON the ballusters at the top of our staircase. Now, 3 years later and 2 kids, it has still survived. Yes, as with all 4 gates in our house, the kids jump and hang on it. BOTH kids actually :) and they are now about 34 lbs each!The gate has not failed us and has not fallen over any of our kids, not even once. A couple of days ago, my youngest daredevil decided he had enough being restricted by the gate. So he dedicated himself to opening it. This is a 20 month old, 34 lbs, very strong and very determined baby.He DID manage to push it the other way, then proceeded to sit in front of it and push it until one of the hinges finally gave in.3 years, almost 70 lbs of kids constantly jumping on it. I don't think there are many gates that would have taken that kind of punishment and still work.So, overall I am happy and I just ordered replacement hinges for the broken ones. The hinges that were included in the original package were the plastic ones that a lot of people here call defective.Maybe I was lucky or maybe because I did not follow the temlpate I did install it correctly. Either way, once you've had a kid and had to assemble all the convoluted baby furniture and such, it becomes evident that incorrect/incomplete instructions are fairly common.",4
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","My Moby is an absolute necessity for me!  I've tried a few different carriers and, for comfort and extended wear, nothing compares!  I had to attend a conference when my baby was 2 months old and, knowing she likes to be held and that we would be having to run around a lot, the stroller wasn't going to be ideal.  She spent hours in the Moby throughout that week and my back never once felt the strain of wearing her even with all the walking - indoors and out - that I had to do.  She sleeps soundly in it even still at 7 months old and the option to secure her head is spectacular.  Some mommies told me they couldn't really use it past 6 months old max, but even though she is a very chunky monkey, I still have no problem using it and she loves it.  She feels so secure and the weight is distributed amazingly.  She weighs just under 20 lbs and I can comfortably wear her for hours.  It can get rather hot, especially since she is a heavy sweater.  I have worn her in hot weather, but not ""dead of summer"" kind of hot weather.  I recommend it highly to all my friends.  If I could've used it only for that one week at that conference, it would've been worth the price, but it's been such an amazing product throughout the months.  We were even able to do a haunted ghost walk in colder weather with her and she slept snug and warm the entire time.  When my friends watch me put it on, they all freak as it does look like it'd be the most complicated thing ever, but we found the hold she likes and use that and it's easy peezy.  If I know I'm going to want to use it, I will put it on before we leave so that I don't have to worry about it dragging the ground or dirty floors as I wrap it around me.  Then, I just get her from her carseat and put her right in when we get there.  You Tube has lots of videos that show how to wrap that helped me out.  And it's not touted as being a nursing wrap, but I have used it many, many times and nursed her at the same time.  Seriously, this is easily one of my favorite baby products ever made.  I have three slipped discs in my lower back and the Moby doesn't aggravate that at all.  My son's baseball season starts soon and I'm team mom and have no concerns about fulfilling my duties with my big girl in her Moby.",5
"Kalencom Laminated Buckle Bag, Multi Paisley Watermelon","I ordered this bag for my identical twin boys we are expecting. I have always loved Kalencom bags. They are durable and I love the fact that you can wipe them off. I was so disappointed when I received this bag. It did not look like it appears in the photos. The description may mention this, but I did not notice it. I thought the bag was black and white. When we opened the box it is black, brown, and white. Unfortunately, we returned it b/c we did not care for the brown. I will say we had a pleasant expierence with our return, prompt credit. Thank you Amazon",3
"Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Double Sided Wipes, Blue Emb.",I use these wipes to wipe my daughter's bottom. We currently use cloth diapers and picked these wipes because I liked the fleece side option.The fleece is soft (even after several washes and I do not use fabric softener). It is gentle on her bottom and it gets all the poop off. I use the fleece side to clean up the poop and the cotton side as a once over at the end.We also purchased the Organic Cotton Wipes from Amazon and use those if we are changing a diaper with just urine.Others have complained that these wipes repel water. I do not remember having any issues with repelling water but I did wash the  wipes before using them and I do not use fabric softener. Fabric softener will cause my cloth diapers to repel water and I wash these wipes with my cloth diapers.,5
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow",Only 6 months pregnant getting ready for baby had this placed in my bassinet just cuz. My kitten decided to use the bassinet as a littler box and urinated on it. The pad protected my number sheets and matress. I was very pleased to say the least. I ended up washing it on hot despite urine being sterile and the product label states to was on cold so it looks a little funny now but still soft.,5
Camp Grandma Green Photo Tote Bag,"I found this bag after looking high and low for a gift for my grandmother for Christmas. I settled on this and it was great.

The Door Guardian Childproofing Lock Colors: White,"I bought this for security instead of childproofing. Yesterday a man tried to kick in my front door while I was home alone. He was not able to gain entry and when the police arrived they said they thought it was because of this lock. It was super easy to install, however, I did use longer screws than what came in the package. I have had this lock installed since 2011 and never had a problem with it. I was very thankful to have had it yesterday and highly recommend it to anyone.",5
Jeep Trek Easy Travel Playard,"I thought this was a really cool play/travel yard when I first put it together.  I picked it out because it looked smaller and we are in a small place but then I realized a standard packnplay sheet would not fit properly. I was unable to find one by the Jeep brand so I used the standard packnplay sheet but it would come up and get bunched.  I also had the zipper get caught on the fabric after about a week so now it continues to catch. I stopped closing it up so that it wouldn't break off completely.I do really like the wheels on the one side. It's very easy to move around. The built in storage was cool too. However, my newborn daughter didn't seem to like laying in it much.  After a few minutes she would start fussing and she doesn't do that in her crib or seats.  It's not padded well so I guess it's just uncomfortable for her.  I really wish that Amazon had offered the free return shipping when I purchased this so I could have picked something else.",2
Sesame's Elmo Bath Mat 'splish Splash',"My son loves this bathmat. He had begun to crawl around the tub when we got it, and now he is able to stay still (and stand to get out) without slipping. I never experienced the bad smell that others have talked about in their reviews--perhaps this is a problem they fixed in later productions? It sticks well, the only downside is that since it is a clear mat, it does stain, and takes a little bit of extra work to clean. Also, the red dye ran a little bit, which makes the underside look a little gross, but a bath mat is going to grow mold I suppose.",4
Fisher-Price Smart Stages 3-in-1 Rocker Swing,"I ordered the Rocker Swing as a gift for a new baby in the family, so I cannot review it first hand. However, the happy mom and baby, are raving about hours of swinging fun!  They are certainly enjoying the swing and are very happy with the gift.",5

Baby Einstein Discovering Water Rocker Seat,"I got this as a hand-me-down,so...  I wanted this seat so that my 2 yr old could share the new baby's toys (jealousy, you know).  My toddler LOVES it!  She loves anything with fish, of course:)  But, she really likes to sit in it, likes the music, thinks the vibrations are funny, is enamoured with the toys.But, I guess when I read rocker, I imagined it rocking the baby sort of like a swing.  That's not what this does, it simply can rock back and forth when the kick stand is down.  However, it really doesn't do that on the carpet, it's pretty stationary.  And it doesn't have bouncy wires like a bouncy seat.  It's not really flexible like a bouncy, it's very sturdy.  So, I'll update on the seat when the new baby comes.  But, for now, I'd say this is a cute seat, but I don't think I'd pay the full price just for a seat.  Maybe if I had more money:)",4
"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear",We really like these containers. They stay closed and we use them everyday for daycare. They are the perfect size for a baby just starting out on solids. We just ordered our second set. Soon we will need the bigger size.,5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow",I have twin boys with really bad reflux.I tried propping up cosleeper mattress & they slid down to bottom.My friend swore by this & I brushed it off until I needed a slanted sleeping surface. I hated to separate my boys but they love this.It helps with reflux & if they spit up at least its going down & they dont choke on it. I dont need to keep them up as long watching them after feedings.They are snug in it & comfy & sleep like a dream in it.It is light & very portable.I recommend to anyone!!,5
"OsoCozy 6 Pack Prefolds Unbleached Cloth Diapers, Size 1","I'm a first time cloth diaper-er and haven't tried any other prefold. After doing my amazon review research these were my favorite and I haven't been disappointed. I use the jellyroll method with diaper pins and use a thirsties size 1 cover. There are very rarely any blowouts, and when there are it never gets on the clothes. They're very absorbent - our little girl hasn't needed night changes since maybe 4-5 weeks old (she's a light night soiler though). I don't even use a liner with them at night (which is only aggravating because they're bought, washed, and unreturnable. Oh well - backup wipes!).Most importantly they don't irritate her bum. I use Bordeaux's natural butt paste (green bottle) since it won't clog the cloth. On the rare occasion I have to use disposables, by 2 days of using the cloth any diaper rash starts fading and by 5-7 days its completely gone.I didn't bother with a toilet sprayer, I just rinse mine in the basement slop sink when I have a small load (2 days worth, approx 24-30 diapers). I also use rock the green detergent for them in bare naked babies which I love.We've been using these prefolds at 9 lbs (when her cord fell off) first we folded it in the back, we started front folding at 12 lbs. I think they might shrink a little because some do not fit the same as others, but its so subtle it's not an actual complaint, that's just why we started front folding. Even with a front fold she has yet to poo up past the back of the diaper (the back fold pocket would catch some of that before it went to disaster status).She's 15 lbs now and we still have to fold it down in the front - but not nearly as much. By 18 lbs I'm guessing well stop folding down. Just to give you a size reference.We also had the better fit infant size (purple edging, up to 16lbs) they were great too, these are still our main ones because they have a broader weight range (when rolling and pinning).Good luck!",5

Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I had to travel and didn't want to bring my large electrical breast pump. So I ordered this manual pump and I like it.Pros:- Easy to use - I like the letdown trigger- Easy to assemble- Easy to clean- Small for travel or a quick pump without pulling out the electric pumpCons:- Sometimes if I screw the bottle on too tight, the suction decreases. I unscrew by one thread and it seems to work better.",4
"Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count",This bottle system is wonderful.  The liners are so easy to use and they're even better for keeping everything clean and sterile.  They're wonderful!  My baby goes between bottles and being nursed and she has no problem at all.,5
Chicco Activity Baby Walker,"I received this item as a christmas gift for my son when her was six months old,but didn't open it until  My son absolutely loves this product. It's very interactive and the music that plays while he walking makes him want to walk with it more often.I have one big issue with this item which is why it lost three stars. The issue I have is that the hole where a child can put the balls in is big enough to where my twelve month old could reach his hand and arm into it. I was in the next room working on dinner when I heard this blood curdling scream from my son. I went in to find out why and found he had his arm up to his elbow stuck in the ball hole. It took me a bit to angle his arm out. His arm was red for about an hour or so and it also left a small bruise.",2
Econobum One Size Cloth Diapers Trial Pack (Mirror),Very economical. .. but not for us.  We switched to rumparooz and gave these away.,3
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",We have several gates that are used in verious areas of our house (day care) the quality of the gate is well known to us and this one was no exception.,5
Dwink Box - the Only True Universal Juice Box Holder,A great tool for a toddler with a juice box.  It keeps little man from squeezing the juice out of the box and he seems to like hanging on to the handles.,5
"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane","This car seat has surpassed my expectations. I love that I can adjust the straps from the front. We had the Graco Snugride and it was a pain in the butt to adjust straps. My only word of caution is it's huge. If you have a 2 door car, you may want to consider another car seat. We have twins and have 2 of these seats and they take up our whole back seat. Other than that these are wonderful car seats to own and they are well worth the money. Our girls are almost a year old and we expect them to be able to use these seats until they are at least 3 years old.",5
"Bunnies by the Bay Bye Bye Buddy Blanket, Blossom",This bunny lovey is soo cute.  It's so soft and my daughter loves it!  I would love to have a few more!,5
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","These brushes are perfect for cleaning the reusable starbucks straws! But that's all I can say, I haven't used them for anything else and they are just for cleaning straight straws. They come in a package of four and I've only used one so far. Looks like the price is worth it for how long these brushes will last me :)",5
Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"This stroller is made of very cheap material. Merely after a few months of light use, the stroller is already hard to push, and wheels are easily stuck whenever I try to make a turn. Even for a less than half-an-inch road bump, I have to physically get in front of the stroller and lift the front wheels in order to get pass. The shopping basket touches the ground whenever the road is a little uneven, and the outside fabrics is already worn out.Not to mention, the sun shades are no use at all because they are too small. Without buying an extention shade, they are practically just some decoration to make this product more look like a stroller. It is definitely not worth the price. BTW, their customer service is terrible as well.",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,It is just what they wanted for their new bundle of JOY. They wanted the side to side swinging. Not the forward and back.,4
"Nuby 2-Pack Nibbler, Colors May Vary","My 4 month old son has been teething like crazy, but does not like the standard teething rings. Finding something that he can chew on that is safe, and appealing has been a challenge - however, this product has solved my problem! I can put frozen fruit such as bananas or peaches in it, without having to worry about him choking or getting it all over his hands. This allows the soothing coolness and the taste of the fruit at the same time. Compared to other brands or in store deals, the price was great. I've already recommended this product to several of my other mommy friends. (:",4
Spiderman Teether Friends,My 7 month old grandson absolutely loves this teether. He chews on the rubber hands and also on the head and feet. His older brothers love that it is Spiderman. I had to order a second so there is always a clean one. Also my daughter loves that this teether can go into the washing machine.,5
Malden Nursery Parade Baby Metal Picture Frame,"great product! Very good quality, solid design! Came in great condition! Highly reccomended to those looking for a nice baby frame.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie is our family's favorite teether! She is easy for tiny hands to grip on to, and her hooves get back to the molars, so she's perfect for older babies too!  Our Sophie has survived two babies and yes, she has faded, but she just looks well-loved.  No rubber odor.  Well worth the $$.",5
Nano Highchair,Love this chair for our apartment.  We live in the city and have little space and this high chair is perfect.  It folds flat and easy to wipe down.  We've used it with both of our boys now (1.5 and 3.5 yrs) and has held up great.  They sit back a little reclined in the seat but not bad.  The tray is easy to clean.  You can remove all the parts for additional cleaning but not the easiest of tasks.,4
Yookidoo Flow 'N Fill Spout Bath Toy (9m+),My daughter loved this toy when she got it. It worked great the first time she used it but that was also the last time. The next day she tried to turn it on but it wouldnt so I thought she might of left it on so I changed the batteries but still nothing.,1
"Baby Trend Expedition Jogger, Vanguard",Very happy with it so far. I walk every where with it. My baby sits comfortly in it and can sleep just fine. I jogged a few times. Just have to make sure front wheel is lovked other wise it shakes. Rides smoothly and i have taken it on rough terran. It did okay. Glad it has bicycle tire wheels.,4
"Kathy Ireland Home 4 Piece Infant Crib Set, Chocolate Mint","I love this for my baby's room but wish I had had the option to purchase the pieces separately.  I hated to spend the money on the bumper pads since I absolutely will not put them in her crib but we got creative and used the bumpers to make a window valance, that way we didn't have to purchase the separate valance!",4
The First Years Learning Curve Floating Stars Teether,"Do not buy this.  After using it for a few months, it burst in my daughters mouth.  It's obviuosly scary  not knowing what the goo is and if it's harmful or not since she definitely swallowed some.  See other reviews and you'll notice I'm not the first person this happened to.  I'd advise you to buy a different teether.",1
Fisher-Price Apptivity Gym for iPhone &amp; iPod Touch Devices,"It doesnt support my iPhone 5! BOO!! I bought this because I was going to use it with my phone, but iphone 5 does not fit",2
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Double Stroller, Red","First of all hats off to amazon for fast free shipping. I had the stroller a day and a half after ordering online and selecting the free shipping option.As for the stroller, I love, love this stroller.  I have a three year old and a five month old. My three old is tall and fits very comfortably in the seat. The baby fits great too with the seat reclined back a bit. The assembly is so easy. I had my three old helping me put the wheels and canopy on (that's all you have to do).  I am amazed by how light this stroller is and how easy it is to push. I have been taking it on limestone/ small gravel trails and it pushes with a breeze. I love the adjustable handle. I am short and hubby is tall. We are able to switch back and forth with ease.  The basket underneath the seats is very large. It would be hard to get a full size diaper bag in but if you have a smaller bag it would not be very difficult.  You can get in the storage basket from the side or the back.  The wheels on this stroller are great. They are like a jogging tire but a little smaller and forever air tires.  The canopies are great. Very large. Overall, I am so happy I got this stroller. I looked for about a year and was not so sure about spending $600 on a stroller but I am so glad I did it. It is hands down 100 times better than any other double stroller out there.  My husband is even happy about the stroller. He loves it too.",5
Texas Longhorns Sippy Cup Set,"We live in Colorado, and so I do my best to show my Texas pride whenever possible.  Yep, that means making sure my kids are often decked out in burnt orange too.  These sippy cups help me do just that.  They're really very durable and very, very easy to clean (don't forget the little plastic piece in the lid).  I'm very pleased with how well the printing has held up to frequent drops, bangs, and dishwasher cycles.  They're also a great size for little hands (my daughter is now 16 months and we've had these for maybe 5 or 6 months now).  I'm actually about to order another set to replace other sippy cups that have proven way too hard to clean or leak.",5
Evenflo Dual Electric Breast Pump,I had to purchase a new pump on the fly because my Avent pump died at work. SO I got this one because it was cheaper than the Avent single pump. This pump was recommended by friends and I have to say that so far it has not disappointed me. The suction is fantastic and it's very quick....10-15 versus the 30-40 minutes with the Avent pump. Sometimes it's ok to spend less money and get a good product than to spend more money on a product that is all brand name. I would recommend this to others :),5
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant",Wonderful product... My little girl will be soo comfy and cozy on the go!..Love the fact that its waterproof! Fits prefect in my infant carrier!,5
"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary",Great for twins due to having 4 slots instead of the normal 3!  I have 2 and I use then both when traveling or just out and about.,5
Euro-Baby Fastfold Fts Black,"Looks good in theory, but I think too big for my 14-month-old.  However, stroller enthusiasts rave about this, and I have been advised to hang on to it until my son gets older.  It does look like a very comfortable seat, and it is certainly great to push.  Not much of a basket though, and the canopy and recline are non-existent.  So probably good for quick in-and-out-of-the-car deals.UPDATE: My son is now 18 months old and has grown into it.  It is lightweight, compact, and great to keep in the car for quick trips.  The steering is excellent - I can push it with one hand while walking beside it.  Even though I'm shopping for a double now, I'll definitely keep this on hand.",4
"RaZbaby RaZ-Pak Formula and Snack Container, Transparent Blue","I really like to use these containers for formula... I no longer spill half of the powder every time I try to make my son a bottle. I can also see how these containers will grow with him. My only disappointment was the colors shown are not the colors I recieved. Instead of clear containers I recieved translucent blue containers with orange writing. Not a deal breaker, I just wish they were clear.",5
"Gerber Washcloths, Gorilla, Boy, 6-Count","These washclothes are way too thin. I washed them immediately with a load of my daughter's clothes and everything ended up with pink stains on it. To say I was furious is an understatement, the load of laundry was all new clothing for her and everything was ruined. Don't buy this.",1
Bright Starts Petals and Friends Activity Gym,I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. She has played with this so many times that I surprised it is still working.,5
Eddie Bauer Broadmoor Diaper Bag,I bought this bag for my son who is now 15 months. It's perfect for downsizing a diaper bag. We no longer need to pack bottles etc so this has been working great for us. Worth the purchase!,5
Sunshine Systems LEDGP14 GlowPanel 14 Watt LED Grow Light,"I bought two Glowpanels from Sunshine systems and one stopped working after two months of use.  I sent it back to the company and they refused to give me a refund or send me a replacement panel.  They said the unit was discontinued at the beginning of the year, but even after I sent a receipt they did not replace the panel.  I'm disappointed I spent so much money for something that laster for two months and won't buy anything from Sunshine Systems again.",1
"Philips AVENT 2 Pack BPA Free Decorated Toddler Cup, 12+ Months, 9 Ounce, Styles and Designs May Vary","March 25, 2011:  I ordered these cups for my 1 year old daughter because they can hold 9 ounce of liquid and they have handles, or that is what I thought.  I also liked the adorable designs they had on them.  When I received the cups I was very surprised, because they were plain and didn't have handles.  They were also only 5 ounce cups.  It is like someone put the 6+ month cups into 12+ month packaging.  The packaging even said 9 ounce on there.  I contacted Amazon and they immediately shipped out another set.  I am hoping this time they send me the right cups.Update - March 26, 2011:  Less than 24 hours ago I was chatting with a customer representative from Amazon.com about the above-mentioned issue and I can happily report that they mailed me the right cups overnight!  It is a great product and very cute.  My daughter can hold unto the handles and lift the cup.  Also, the valve can be taken out for kids who are more advanced.  The cup can be taken apart so it is easily washable.  The lid is great!  I am very happy with Amazon.com because of their fabulous customer service and Avent because this is truly a great product!!!",5
Evenflo Single Breast Pump,"My milk came in full force when my son was three days old. This was my first child so I had no idea what I was doing when choosing a pump.  My husband ran to the store and bought this pump since I hadn't decided on one yet.So far I have had this pump three months and it works well. Since we are a Military Family and are in the processes of moving (soon to be three times in 8 months) the fact that this pump runs off batteries as well as a plug is a great feture. I did have to use this pump a couple times a day for a week or two and it held up quite well.It is a little loud, but my son sleeps through anything. My sister in law gave me a Medela and that was when I really noticed the sound. The Medela was a little faster when it came to pumping, but it wasn't that big of a deal. If you only have to pump a little this is a good pump. I would highly recomend it. However if you work full time I would recommend going with a Medela or something of that nature. Being able to have a double pump would make things easier.",4
"American Baby Company Twin Pack 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Crib Sheet, Natural","I love these sheets. They're wonderfully soft, cuddly, and, due to their slight stretch, very easy to put on a crib mattress. These are 5 star sheets with one glaring problem. They smell horrible. They're packaged in some very, very stinky vinyl. I literally washed them three times and one of them still smelled very strongly, while the smell on the other had faded for the most part. So gross. What bothers me most of all is that these are organic and they still package them in toxic material. Well, hello! Consumers informed enough to buy organic in the first place know/care about the dangers of vinyl. Give me a break. I know the can package using a different material, because I ordered some organic cotton pillowcases that came in a completely unscented bag with recycling code 5 on it. Buy at your own discretion, but be prepared to wash the bejesus out these things.",3
Serta Nightstar Extra Firm Crib Mattress,"This mattress was a great purchase, the price was right and it's very convenient to not have to go to the store for this big lug. Fit into the crib (Graco Lauren crib by LaJobi) perfectly and the baby sleeps very well. No complaints, we are happy!",5
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black",i got exactly what i was hoping for. it is light weight and easy to assemble and get around with,4
"Trend Lab Ultimate Diaper Bag, Brown/Blue","This diaper bag is amazing! We actually have two! As the mother of a 16 month old, this bag has been great as it has plenty of pockets of different styles, matching changing pad, insulated bottle pockets, a hook for keys, a padded strap, it zips shut, and has lots of room.  My husband likes that it is black (or silver- we have two) but I like the colored accent trim and inside linining.  I would definitely suggest this bag.",5
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,This does not work at all. It barely keeps up on the wall. You have to hang it on the railing or get extra hooks for it.I like it because it does keep everything in place and dries up the toys fairly quickly. But the fact that the suction cup does not work is most annoying.,3
Merry Muscles Ergonomic Jumper Exerciser Baby Bouncer - Red,"I read a lot about this before I ordered it, and I was a little skeptical. When it finally arrived, from Canada, I was so excited ... then I opened the box. It looks like nothing! Looks cheap, and kinda ugly ... BUT, OMGoodness ... it is the best thing I have bought for the baby thus far. He loves it. He loves, loves, loves it! I love it! Everyone loves to watch him in it. It is so funny. It wears him out, strengthens his muscles, and gives him exercise he typically would not get as he is not able to walk. I believe he was in this at two months, maybe three ... read the description for the product to be sure, either way it is designed to be used earlier than other jumpers. I had him using it and then checked in with my Dr on the development of his legs and feet and he said everything looks great!My son is big, started out really small 6.14 ... but he grew fast, so I had to take out a set of stitches on the opposite side of the snaps. Read the directions on that because it is important. I figured out I needed to do that after calling the company to inquire as to why he would be jumping using only his left leg. I removed the inner set of stitches (there are two)  which made the bodice part wider, even on both sides, and he was back to two feet!Great, life saver, fantastic, wonderful, I love it!Make sure you safely secure the hook in a stud, make sure it is secure!!",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Love this booster seat. We have tried several different seats and this by far has been the best. Straps perfectly to every seat we have used it on, has removable back, 2 trays, height adjutment, adjustable straps, 3pt harness, folds comatc for travel or storage and also seems to be the most comfy to sit in for our 2 boys. We will also be using this same seat for our 3rd boy when the time comes. Worth every penny!",5
"BooginHead SippiGrip, Pink/Green/White","This is awesome for toys, passies, sippies...  I was using Dropper Stoppers and really liked those but our dog ate one of them so I needed another.  I really liked this pattern & material so I tried it.  It is great - I like the velcro/adjustable straps.  I actually wish I had about 10 of these to use in the house, in the car, in the stroller... but can't justify purchasing that many :)  Highly recommend.",5
Baby Girl Pooh Disney - Baby's First Five Years Keepsake Record Book with Storage Box,The book is cute.  Not as many pages and I had expected.  Some places don't require as much writing as it gives you but might be good to fill in with pictures. I haven't tried it.  Other pages (like the shower) need a little more space. Overall the book is cute and is as described on the listing. There is a lot of storage in the box that it comes with.  I can't want to complete it and give it to my god-daughter's mom.,4
"Maclaren Volo Stroller, Black","Bought this for my 5yo 45lb son for a trip to Disney World. Sturdy, light-weight and worked great. The only shortcoming is that the canopy supports are flimsy and may not last long, otherwise 5 stars.",4
Infantino Explore and Store Elephant Gym,"The bar that arches over the top doesn't stay in place.  The straps that hold it don't hold very well.  On the plus side, my daughter thinks it's hilarious when she pops it out and it flies up and lands across her belly.  LOL!  More entertainment for her. (Don't worry guys it's made of foam ;).  Recieved it in a short amount of time.  Not the 3-4 weeks that I thought.  Only took about a week.",4
"My Brest Friend 3 in 1 Body Pillow, White","A total waste of my time and money! There is absolutely no back support so if your pregnant back is as achy as mine, invest in another product and avoid this one (I kicked it off the bed). Better yet, make your own pillow- a combination of regular pillows and your partner- it will work more effectively.",1
Yookidoo Discovery Playhouse,"My 14 month old twins recieved this for Christmas and it is amazing!  They love to play in it together (they both ift inside well) or peek through it and giggle at each other.  The balls rattle which they love and there are so many differnet ways to play- ball rollercoasters and tunnels, spinning toys, mirror- they are ative and love to chase each other inside and out. I also feel that thsi toy is safe for 12 months or even younger.  There are no sharp or small pieces and it is very sturdy.  They can use it to pull to stand and cruise it- it will slide a little but does not fall or collapse, even with two babies pulling on it. This is an a amazing toy!",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"this is a great little stroller. it is heavier than you expect, but well built. the seat does recline a bit more than my son would like and doesn't seem to adjust to sit up straighter. it's bigger than you expect an umbrella stroller to be, but much better than cramming our jogging stroller in the car. Bought for road trips and times when we go to amusement parks, zoos, aquariums, etc. where the jogging stroller is just too big.",4
WubbaNub Brown Puppy,My 3 month old daughter loves her Wubbanub's and the dog is great.  I would have given in 5 stars but the legs are not beans so there is a stiffness to the dog.  We also have the black cat and we can position that one a little better and my daughter can snuggle with it better.  Overall we love them and can't imagine not having them.,4
Pink Camouflage Messenger,"I bought this bag before finding out what the sex of our baby is.  I have two boys already, I decided that even if we have another boy, I wanted this bag for me.  My husband (he didn't see it before I bought it) liked it too and said he will carry it if we have a girl.  I was shocked at that!  It's such a cute bag!  Finally having a baby doesn't mean that you have to carry a Winnie-the-Pooh, cheesy diaper bag!",5
Chicco Activity Baby Walker,"Not a bad walker but as a previous person mentioned, it tips forward very easily and the brakes don't do anything to stop the child.  The activities in front are good, and my son likes playing with it that way but I don't really trust it as a walker.",2
"Friendly Toys, Little Playzone with Electronic Sound and Lights","This item is great! It is easy to assemble, very portable, and allows the child to entertain him/herself. I would recommend this product to everyone.",5
North States Industries Supergate Extra Wide Swing Gate,"When I read that this was a ""swing gate"", I took that to believe it had a door portion that would swing open.  That is not the case.  You have to mount this to both sides of the walls then detach one side to ""swing"" the entire gate open.  It is not what I was looking for.  On top of that, we got it because we have a very wide space in our kitchen that we needed to close off for our 11 week old Pomeranian puppy, but the slots in this gate are too wide and he can actually get through the gate!  So for us, this gate is totally useless.  Unfortunately, I discovered this on the 4th day I had it and I didn't realize that Amazon's free return policy expired 2 days after it is delivered, so we are stuck with this.We ended up purchasing another tension mounted gate with a REAL swing door which will be arriving tomorrow.  I hope the slots aren't as wide so it keeps our puppy within it's confines.",2
"Prince Lionheart 2 Count Faucet Extender, Gray/Pink",Works great & looks good too. I got the white & grey one. It blends in nicely with my bathroom. It makes washing hands with my two tear old twins soo easy. They love using it.,5
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White",This mattress cover is definitely too small.  I am returning it immediately.  I can't believe these people would make a product that is supposedly designed for the Graco Pack and Play...and then make it TOO SMALL!  Seems crazy to me.  It's going back tomorrow.,1
Maxboost Fusion Snap-on iPhone 5S/5 Case - Navy Blue (Fit Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5S/5),"I love the color, it's better than I used one. The only down would be it is a bit smoother than I would like. If it had some noticeable grip the case would be awesome, but I still give 5 stars.I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation",5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"My 1 month old has reflux, and while she did not like the bouncer originally, she loves it now.  We use it for her to sleep in.  My only complaint is that I wish the fabric was softer.",4
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Cambria Bassinet, Toffee",We decided to purchase this Arms Reach Co-Sleeper. We're able to roll it around our condo for easy convenience and access for our newborn daughter. Her crib and changing table /dresser are on back order for a few more weeks so this is perfect for us to use for the next few months. Matches all of our expresso furniture and dark wooden floors. One of my TOP baby item purchases. I would highly recommend this item / seller.,5
Summer Infant Mother's Touch Comfort Bath Support,Item was purchased for my granddaughter and she loves it. Lots of cushion seems very comfortable hang drys very quickly.,5
NoJo Jungle Tales 6 Piece Crib Set,"Got this crib set for our little guy who will be here soon. Nice, quality materials, vivid colors, good value. The one issue we had was tying the crib bumper. We have a standard size crib, a Bedford Baby Monterey, and besides being difficult to tie, the bumper is way too long. It is not snug at all like recommended and therefore not very safe for the baby. Now I wish I just got the separate pieces from this set, not including the bumper (although it is a very cute one).",4
Baby Aspen Pig-n-A Blanket 2-Piece Gift Set,"How many times have you attended a baby shower and saw that great gift everyone gushed over, wishing you had thought of it first?  Well, Baby Aspen Pig-n-A Blanket is that great gift!  The concept, of a &#34;pig in a blanket&#34;, is way cute and Baby Aspen has produced a sweet, sweet vision in this adorable little stuffed treasure.  The Pig and its blanket appear to be constructed of quality materials. Each has a soft, comforting feel that will satisfy Mom as well as Baby.  The embroidered nursery verse, found on the plush blanket's satin border, is a nice touch and adds to the Keepsake factor.  And, the plush Pig is designed to become a Special Friend for your Special Little One for many years.  Two wonderful gifts packaged as one, Baby Aspen Pig-n-A Blanket is a unique and precious gift that will keep on giving long after the package is opened.",5
Baby Kimono Gown Sleepers,"I have been slowly adding items to my layette, and this sleeper is one of the softest and cheapest items in the collection so far. It is simple yet well-made, and though it's a classic piece, it's hard to find things this basic. It ranks in quality and feel with Petit Bateau, Coccoli and other high-end European baby wear. I highly recommend this item!",5
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","This gate is perfect for what I was looking for- a sturdy pressure gate with larger width and heighth to keep our 60-lb dog in our front yard. One thing to note, when opening the gate, you need to pull up on the door enough to release the top & bottom ""latches"".  Once you explain it to others, we've found that its not an issue. It should definitely work to keep smaller children in, as releasing the door takes more coordination than younger ages might have. Make sure everyone steps over the 1"" rise when walking through the door-- or you might be readjusting the gate to get it back into place.  Overall, I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I like the sturdiness and the look of this metal gate.  My 7 and 9 year old children have no problems using it-- and our dog is happy to be able to join us in the front yard.",5
"timi &amp; leslie Rachel 7-Piece Diaper Bag Set, Black","This bag is fantastic. Wonderful. It is very stylish and extremely functional.  It is super spacious and has a place for everything.  I was carrying a Coach tote bag because I have several and didn't think a disper bag was necessary.  i thought I could use the Coach tote since it is large and roomy but things were everywhere.  The timi and leslie bag helps me keep it all organized imstead of everything jumbled up all over the bottome of the bag.  The win color is beautiful.  I so wanted to avoid a baby looking diaper bag and I hit the jackpot with this bag because it is so fabulously stylish.  I am not sacrificing style while carrying this bag as a new mom.  My favorite feature is the small purse inside that allows me to organize my things like makeup, money, phone, etc. separately.  I love this bag!",5
"Nuby Milk Powder Dispenser, Colors May Vary","This thing DOES NOT LEAK.  It can hold up to 5 scoops of Enfamil in each of the 3 chambers (= 10 oz in the bottle  x three), and is easy to dispense, even with one hand, on a turbulent airplane. For refills, the whole top comes off super easy as well. (For those who have trouble removing the top, try lining the spout up with a chamber line&#8230; i.e.. yank the top up from where it's sturdiest.)",5
"My Brest Friend Slipcover, Blue Gold Marina","My son had an EXPLOSIVE poop all over the original slipcover to this nursing pillow and I had no intentions of trying to clean it... I ordered this one and it fits great (and is much prettier than the other one I had!). Even after washing/drying, it fits nicely and is easy to put back on. I recommend this if you want to switch things up :) Do wash it before you put it on though, as it comes out of the package rather stiff.",5
Vilac Developmental Memory Game,"Memory game.Cute.Well made.We wrote in French on it to aid in memorization.Overall, a good deal, seems like it will last.",4
Beco Baby Gemini Carrier In Paige,"I bought this item along with the Ergo Baby justBecause I was having such a hard time deciding between the two. I got the Ergo and thought it was comfortable and wellMade and easy to use. HOWEVER, I am a petite person and even when I had the straps adjusted all the way down I still had a very hard time buckling the back buckle by myself so I ended up returning it.The Beco on the other hand is a much more versatile carrier because it offers several more carries and it seems the straps have a lot more wiggle room in terms Of adjustments. I also liked how for a facing in front carry you have the option to make the leg base narrower. I can easily reach my hands over my head and buckle the back buckle by myself. Also every review I read complained that you need 2 hands to unbuckle which I haven't found to be the case at all. I buckle it around my waist and keep the sides buckled at all times then pick up and position my baby put the straps over my shoulders one by one while supporting her with one arm them buckle behind my head. To take it off I follow the same steps in reverse and hold my index finger down on the safety feature of the waist buckle and unclasp the buckle with my thumb and middle finger. My daughter is 3 months and 11 lbs and I've used it about a month now and have never once risked dropping her or had problems getting this on or off.I feel safe and secure walking and doing household chores while using this. And my baby seems to love it too. It has definitely made life easier :)",5
"OXO Tot Training Cup, Aqua, 7 Ounce","First of all, the review by Kenneth M. Saltzman (one of the top reviews) is right on. If your little one is getting too much liquid, try using two of the covers (called something else I can't quite remember) to block more fluid.I first tried these out when my son turned one, but he was just not ready yet. He still was treating it like it was a sippie cup and even if I only put in 2mL, it would still get all over him because it was too much too fast. I didn't consider using two of the covers at once, so I just purchased the OXO straw cups of the same size, and they worked perfectly.When little guy turned 15 months, I tried with these again, and he got the hang of it within a few meals. When he was about 18 months, he started to get annoyed by how the covers blocked the liquid, so I just took the covers off, and after a little bit of spills, he can now use a cup like a big boy.I wouldn't recommend these for any baby under the age of one, but I would also caution not to expect your little geniuses to get the hang of drinking from these right away. Learning to drink like an adult is difficult stuff for babies. Just put in small amounts of liquid until they get it down, and then when they can really drink like adults, just remove the covers--now you have an &#34;adult&#34; cup for your little one without having to go out and buy something else right away.",5
Recaro Vivo Lite Child Booster Car Seat - Carbon,"The booster seat is great except for one issue.  The booster seat's plastic ""shoulder-belt holder"" makes it difficult for the shoulder belt to retract and hold firm the seatbelt across my childs' chest.  I notice my boys sitting in their boosters and the strap across their chest is very loose.  I always tell my boys to pull the shoulder belt part tight.  However, during a trip, when they lean forward/sideways to pick something up from the side seat, the belt doesn't retract back and I have to ask them to snug it up again.I have tried everything to get the belt to be able to slide through the plastic easily enough for the belt to retract back into its system.  But, nothing has made this issue better.  My Costco booster seats did not do this.",4
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","My only complaint is that this is not as purple as it looks in the picture... Its more of a pestle pink color. I ordered it for my SON because it seemed purple to go with a tee shirt from my sister but... its definitely more pink. It gets a 4 out of 5 because I will still use it, love these diaper covers over all, Just not the color I expected.",4
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","The seat fits great in our 2010 Toyota Tundra. I had a Graco MySize 70 that was a pain to get my son in. The RXT is great for us because of the low sides, it's easy to slide him in and out of in the middle seat with out 'offering him to the gods'. The only complaint is the shoulder belt install. My truck doesn't have latch hooks for the middle seat, but it is the safest position and it doesn't cause the seats to move forward. I was sweating after I finally got it in. It's not passing the belt through the base, it's the belt lock that's hard to get right. I was doing it by myself. If I had help it might have been easier to get a secure fit. I did find that sitting on the seat while securing the belt worked best.",4
"Sunshine Kids Adjustable Stroller Umbrella Shade, Black",Only wish there was more of a Metal clip then plastic provides adequate shade for my 2 year old and 3 month old while traveling in their stroller.,4
Boppy Rock in Comfort Travel Swing - Pink,"This is the only swing we need for our Little Man (we bought it in blue).  The thing about baby swings is that babies LOVE them, but they only use them a few months, and the full-sized ones take up a huge amount of space.  This is the perfect compromise on all fronts.  My son was born large (nearly 10 lbs at birth), and he still fits in this swing just fine at 4 months and 16 lbs.  We use this product every day and wouldn't trade it.PRO: compact.  Traveled with us to vist Grandparents, fit in car backseat foot well with no problem.  Sits in our living room on the floor by the coffee table without taking up enormous amounts of space like other swings.  Can move it around the house easily to keep baby near me.  Can take it up to the office if we need to have baby there with us.  Very comfy - hammock-like swing keeps baby soothed and not too upright for comfort.  Nice neutral color scheme doesn't look juvenile in my living room.  *FITS INSIDE THE BOPPY HAPPY PLACE PLAYYARD* - My son has very bad allergies/colds, and a few nights we locked the swing (to make it stationary) and just put it inside the playyard so he could sleep more upright - worked like a charm!!CON:  battery life could last longer.  The toy bar is removable, which I like, and it swivels back and forward, but not far enough back or forward.  Sometimes we still bump the baby's head getting him out, though the bar is not hard enough to hurt, which is also good.  The music is just ok... not particularly soothing.  But it does play at 2 levels, which is good.I would highly recommend this product!!  We love it.UPDATE 6/21/10 - My son used this product until he was about 6-7 months old, at which point he was sitting up solidly, preferred floor or bouncer time, and only wanted his swing for naps.  So, if you get this and a decent bouncer, I question whether you really need anything else for activity time for at least the first 8-9 months.",5
"Baby Aspen My Little Night Owl Snuggle Sack and Cap, 0-6 Months","I bought this costume for my 3-mo. old granddaughter who still has her days and nights mixed up!!!  Couldn't be more appropriate!!!  I'm sure she will look precious in it (even though she's really too young for Halloween, I couldn't resist!)",5
"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Learn-to-Flush","My soon to be three year old loved his new potty.  I was having trouble completing the potty training process on the home toilet with a removable ring, he would only pee. When I bought the ring I had gotten rid of his plain potty. Well, needed to get him potty trained if I wanted to get him into a local preschool. That's when we shopped for his potty together online and choose this one. He LOVES IT!! He was in underwear exclusively only 10 days later. I was completely shocked, I think it was a combination of him being ready, and allowing him to be a part in the  purchasing of his potty ;). So glad to be done with diapers!! This potty is interactive with the user, has a great flush noise, and praise songs for when they use the item.",5
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink","We bought two of these, one for each bathroom.  Our two year old loves brushing his teeth and washing his hands independently!",5
Thudguard Baby Protective Safety Helmet Lilac,This safety helmet keeps your kids from bumping to hard objects when he or she falls but our 8 months old can't wear this for more than 10 minutes because gets too hot and sweat from wearing the helmet.Wish it has different material to keep the head cool to be able to wear longer.,3
"Baby Einstein Mobile, Sweet Sea Dreams","I got this product for my son when he was three months old. It has never really held his attention for very long. It is nice to have the ocean sounds to help lull him to sleep, however they only last about twenty five minuets.",3
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Marina the Mermaid",I bought this for my daughter when she was 4months old and this has become one of her favorite friends to play with and take on the road. She loves biting on the green seahorse & Marina's fin. The colors of the mermaid really grab her attention too! A really great purchase!,5
juDanzy solid white baby &amp; toddler boys and girls leg warmers,"Although not the brightest white, my daughter can definitely wear for years to come.

Levana Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery and Talk to Baby Intercom,"For the price point that this are at, I would say this video monitor is a great product. The color display for the daytime picture is crisp and clear. Motion isn't perfectly smooth, but more than good enough and a lot cheaper than the ones with high end video. The nighttime b&w display is a little grainier than I would have like and 10 ft is about the max range of the IR LEDs. At night though it is still good enough for seeing if our boy is moving around or sleeping. Seeing a chest rise from breathing like some may want may be hard to tell, especially without going cross eyed trying to look at the monitor. Range is great. Works anywhere in our house and works out to our mailbox at about 300 ft from the house as long as I am not standing between the transmitter and receiver. I would definitely recommend.",4

Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"This is our fave cup thus far. My little one is 10 months old so we're just starting on sippy/straw cups. This is the first and only cup so far that he has drunk out of.  I love the weighted straw and the handles. I also really like that the straw is flexible so that my little one can bend the straw to fit in his mouth. We have only offered water so far but it's been easy to clean. The cup has been thrown a few times onto hardwood floor and has held up well.  Once be starts using the cup more often, I plan on buying more of these.",4
"Kushies Flushable Biodegradable Diaper Liners, 100 Sheets","I use these with gDiapers gCloth refills. They usually protect the top surface of the gCloth refill, but not always the sides. But much better than having a completely poopy cloth diaper! I love that they're flushable so I don't have any stinky waste in the trash can, and I haven't had any trouble with the toilet. They're good for protecting the cloth diapers from diaper rash cream too. One unsoiled piece went into the laundry by mistake once, and came out good as new again, and I was able to reuse it - makes me wonder just how long they take to biodegrade, but you could save some money reusing them.",5
"OXO Tot Tub Kneeling Mat, Blue","This is great and helps tremendously when bending over the tub to bath the baby.  It pads my knees well so that I can focus on what I am doing and folds away small for between bath times.  It also has great grip so that it doesn't slid nor do I slid on top of it.  I would definitely recommend this product and thought it was a great value.  I use this frequently.  I only wish that it came in other colors so that it better coordinated with our color theme, but that is not a priority I guess.",5
"Munchkin Snappy Bottle Tote, Colors May Vary","My Dr. Brown bottles would not fit in the bag so I am returning it.  Also, be sure you note the word ""Assorted"" in the product title.  I thought I was ordering the one pictured with the owls and got a pink one instead.",3

Bizzy Babee Nursing Cover (Coral),I really wanted to like this but my 3 month old hated it! She cried and wiggled until I pulled her out from underneath this cover. I would go for the hooter hider.,1
"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer","We went thru several versions of bath thermometers before coming across this one...so far it's doing great. Seems sturdy enough to endure the manhandling of our two year old without dying on us, and readings are accurate. I like the blue, green and red lights that radiate even thru bubbles!",5
"OXO Tot Fork and Spoon Set, Green",I got a set of these to try at our local baby store and was thrilled at how our little one took to them. They are very nicely shaped for little hands and mouths and has improved our oldest's ability to eat without adult help.  I also loved how they are turqouise/aqua so they work well for both boys AND girls which is really hard to find out there!  We will have to buy some more when our littlest starts eating on their own because our oldest loves them so much!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"I bought this but my little one is definitely not old enough yet to grasp the concept...but she is getting there and lives to play with it, and so do I! Not annoying but very good tones. Love it, bought one for my nephew and cousin too!",5
"Bumkins Nixi Travel Bag with Clear Front, Mica, 3 Count","bought for camping & have worked so far- used medium for frozen food item so there was still condensation that got things a bit damp but expected that. use the large one for a toiletry bag. some things will cling to the clear side, but not an issue. will buy more if needed.",4
BABYBJORN Babysitter Balance Air - Black Mesh,"Our five month old still sits in this thing all the time.  It provides the perfect amount of support for him and he stays happy in it for awhile.  We love that it is easy to pick up and move from room to room as we need to, and that it folds in to nothing for travel.  Awesome product.",5
"Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep",I read several reviews and decided that even if the Cloud B Lamb wasn't used to soothe and calm the new baby it surely would be a wonderful companion to stroller or any other baby item.  When the item arrived it was so wonderfully soft and sweet that it inspired me to look for similar Lamb items.,5

Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress,"I saw in the baby stores they don't really recommend the soy products, why I don t know. Bit this is pretty good. Hasn't lumped, sagged, shrunk or anything. Well worth the more than half price",5
"Sassy 2 Count Grow Up Cup, Purple/Orange, 9 Ounce","FYI, I've been using the same set of 6 that I purchased 18 months ago when I wrote my original review.  Ours do not leak, but you need to separate the ribbed ring from the hard plastic top to wash them, or they can stretch and--yes, possibly leak (not to mention harboring germs).  Separate them to wash and you won't have issues.So here is my general update:My son has been using these cups--the same set--for 18 months now, with no leaking issues.  He is now 4 years old, and I still use these for car trips, water in bed, and out-and-about; essentially, anywhere that you are not sitting at a table where spilling would be a major issue. Heck, I think it's a great idea even for adults (haven't brought myself to be seen using it yet though LOL)My son got too big for the sippies with the spouts, and I got sick of disassembling/reassembling straw cups, plus worrying about the straw part getting clean (no way can those get truly clean, I would guess), so I found these--read below for further tips.P.S.they now come in an insulated version, and I could not be more excited, as the weather is starting to warm up.  They will be great for keeping things cooler in the warmer weather!Original review from 18 months ago:Here's my story, but to get to the point of how to get your child used to the cup, HOLD THE CUP UPSIDE DOWN FOR A FEW SECONDS BEFORE GIVING TO YOUR CHILD THE FIRST FEW TIMES, TO GET THE LIQUID STARTED, TO HELP THEM ""GET"" HOW IT WORKS.  It only took my son one try once I did this.I got a set of two of these cups before my son was used to sippies; he tried them and could not get them to work, so I returned them.Now my son is 30 months old and has been using an open cup for about 8 months, but we still use sippys whenever spilling may be an issue.  I have the Take and Toss sippies, the lids are past nasty at this point, and I found we can no longer get replacement lids, so I had to find something else (we do use straw cups for water, but I don't want to put milk in those).So...I thought I'd try these again.The first time he tried it, he couldn't get anything out and I had to convince him to try it again.  I turned the cup upside down for a few seconds to let the liquid ""get into"" the rubber part a bit (to prime it, so to speak), and the next drink he took, he was hooked (and I haven't had to ""prime"" it since that first time)! He even tells us ""I like this cup"".  I figure even though he's almost 3, it will be worth it to have several on hand as these will be great cups for the car, etc. for quite some time.  An added bonus is these are MUCH easier to clean than sippies-so glad to be done with that, too!!!",5
Chicco Great Shakes Monkey Toy,"My son absolutely loved this guy, we actually had to buy another one because our dog ate the rattle off the first, and it just wasn't the same after that. :( lol.  Once he was older and realized he could pull the chain himself, it was like a whole new toy to him. Mr monkey is a great buy for a newborn, durable, easy to clean. LOVE LOVE!!",5

Skip Hop Treetop Friends Activity Gym,"Love that this is unisex, and all the vibrant coloring...my daughter has enjoyed this toy from 4 months until now, she just turned a year old! There are lots of interactive toys, including a squeaker and a mirror on the mat, as well as some crinkle material and different textures.  It is easy to wash and also easy to fold up to put away! Would definitely recommend it.",5
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot",I am very happy with this pacifier holder. The clip that holds the pacifier to the child is very secure and does not slip off of what it is clipped to. I have had issues with pacifier holders that only have a close-pin type clip that holds it to the child where it slips off. I would recommend this holder to anyone that does not want to have to keep cleaning pacifiers throughout the day because they keep falling on the floor.,5
"Badger Basket Modern Changing Table with 3 Baskets and Hamper, Espresso","My wife and I picked this out after shopping around numerous Big Box stores for the right changing table.  We took a chance with this one and it is better than most in the stores.  Many changing tables were very wobbly and seemed extremely cheaply made.  We read the other reviews and decided on this table.  We are extremely satisfied after one month of use.  If you like this color, you will be satisfied with this changing table.  The larger bin underneath is great for dirty clothes and the three drawers are perfect for storing diapers and hygiene items.  I cannot give 5 stars unless an item is perfect.  There are minor nuances and the build quality could be slightly better.",4

Gerber Brand 3 Pack Boy's Terry Dribbler Bib,"Can't give it 5 stars only because my baby isn't born yet and I don't know how the bibs will hold up.  But I've washed them, and they kept their shape nicely.  And they're super cute!",4
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"We ordered one at the end of the year. It suddenly stopped working after almost exactly a month. Fortunately, it was just within the window to get a replacement. Four months later, the new one died. No picture and then won't pair. Don't waste your money, buy a more expensive one that's going to last more than a few months!",1
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","This was exactly what we needed after we moved into a house with narrow wooden stairs. It was a little tricky to put in but that was probably because I was trying to do it with my kids around. A couple of reviewers said the adhesive pads it comes with to stick to the wall were not needed however I couldn't get mine to stay straight for tightening without them. However, that could just be me. It's very sturdy, my daughter pulls up on it and it hasn't budged and my older kids figured out how to open and close it with no problem. I love that it swings shut automatically in case the kids forget to close it. I'm completely happy with this gate and would recommend it to anyone.",5
"Munchkin Click Lock Re-usable Sippy Cups, 10 Ounce, 8-Count",Love these cups for both my grandchildren.  They can't get the lid off and even when dropped they don't leak.,4
"Prince Lionheart Back to Sleep Sack, Medium, Blue","After the first night, we thought this sleep sack was ok. It fit fine, and the mesh opening at the bottom did seem to keep the boy's feet from getting too stinky. But there were issues: The satin lining makes it kinda hard to hold the baby--he slid around inside it too much. And the zipper is terrible! It feels chintzy from the first time you use it--the pull tab gets stuck. And then on the second morning, we brought our son into bed with us. After a little while we noticed little blue flecks on our sheets. The paint was peeling off the zipper's pull tab! I'm not a maniac about baby safety, and I understand that my boy will be exposed to things and put all kinds of dirt into his mouth, but I certainly don't want it to be detritus that comes off his supposedly baby-safe clothing.If it weren't for the zipper, I'd give this two or three stars. But because of that, it gets one. How hard would it have been for the manufacturer to use a better zipper?",1
"The Safe Sippy 2 2-in-1 Sippy to Straw Bottle, Pink","After trying just about every sippy cup on the market, (Nuby, Nuk, Munchkin, Beaba, etc.), I gave my 10-month-old boys the straw version of the Safe Sippy. They LOVE it. It is just like they're drinking out of a normal straw, which they love doing but is almost always a disaster. It is easy to clean, durable, and doesn't leak (the Munchkin ones are impossible to reassemble after cleaning). I'm amazed there are any negative reviews of these because they are perfect if you're kid likes straws.",5
Delta Fun Time 36 X 36&quot; Play Yard,"I bought this for my twin nephews who are now 14 months while initially they didn't take, (as they sleep in their parents bed with their down comforter and what not) so this ended up being for the grandparents house, it works great now, they're passed out in it as I type this, however I am certain in a few months time I don't know that they'll still be able to sleep in it, I kind of wish I had gotten it sooner. Oh well c'est la vie",5

Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"This potty is great for my two year-old.  It's a potty seat when the legs are folded out and a travel potty when the legs are down (and a baggie is inserted).  As a potty seat, I like that it creates a barrier between my daughter and that toilet seat gap most public toilets have.  It's also stable enough (on most toilets) for me to stand back and let her go on her own (per her request) without slipping or sliding about.  We've also had to use it three times as an emergency travel potty and it's been great.  My only complaint is that my daughter likes going on it so much that one of those frantic stops was a total fake; she just wanted sit on it.It fits in my diaper bag and doesn't add that much bulk or weight.  Although it's always with me, I find that I only use it as a potty seat now when the toilet is particularly icky.One last thing -- it comes in a travel bag that is just a thick, white plastic bag with a drawstring top.",5
Accu-Light One-Second Ear Themometer,"I bought this after trying a ton of others and I was very, very pleased with it till I tried to buy the plastic probe covers. You can't find them anywhere. I also called Safety 1st and they couldn't help me either cause the product was to new and they weren't sure if it was going to stay on the shelf (whatever that means)I do like it and would like to keep it. The light is so nice at night and it reads in less then a second.SO I gave it a rating of a 4 only because of the trouble with the probe covers. I hope they resolve the problem soon...",4

"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I'm 7 months pregnant and reaching that stage where it's hard to find that comfortable position. While I'm not as thrilled about this pillow as I thought I was going to be, it is easier to get comfortable and sleep with it. It has it's pros and cons. First, I found this pillow is super flexible. I can fold the side up and slide out of bed in the middle of the night for my bathroom runs. I was thinking I would have to climb over it but that's not the case, so hubby can still sleep.  I think I'll still use this pillow after the baby is born because it's so flexible you can bend it however you like. Keep in mind it won't just stay in that bend position of course, it isn't a pipe cleaner, but it's flexibility makes it versatile.However, while the flexibility is great, I was hoping for more firmer support in the belly area and the area just above where your bump would lay. If you look at the photos of this product, from the area in the middle for bump support to the area of the &#34;u&#34; bend is leaves much to be desired. It seems there is less filling there, and mine naturally folds there. That's how I flip it up to get out of bed.  It's also bad because that's where I want to ideally lay my head since the &#34;u&#34; bend is so uncomfortable for the neck and shoulders. It's the seam there I think, there is another review that explains it.I used to be more of a stomach side sleeper, but as my pregnancy progressed I found myself more and more wanting to sleep on my back. The main reason I got a pillow like this rather than a candy cane shaped one is cause I thought it would help keep me on my side and still support my back and bump.  Not really the case for me, like I said, it's super flexible.  I like this pillow rather than continuously propping myself up all night with 3 or 4 pillows, but it wasn't my dream pillow.  I say take your chances and return it if it's not the one for you.",3
"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light 2, Black","the setup on this crib is soooo easy. good quality product, small footprint and very portable. not sure how long my baby will fit in this, though. she's 7mo right now, so it will be interesting to see how it serves us once she can stand/climb etc! overall a great purchase, and it will definitely be used for future babies or when we have visitors with little ones!",5

Fuzzi Bunz Cloth Pocket Diaper AQUA - Petite Toddler,We purchased these diapers when our little one was in between sizes. She had outgrown the medium cloth diapers but was not yet ready for the large cloth diapers. The petites were a great option and allowed us to continue cloth diapering for an extended amount of time.,5
Kidswitch Light Switch Extender- 3 Pack,"As others have noted, the hole for the light switch was slightly too small which didn't allow the switch to go completely to the &#34;on&#34; position. We haven't filed it down yet, but it should be an easy fix.  Also, it doesn't glow in the dark, at least not in our room, I suspect it has to really soak up light for several hours in order for that to happen. For the price, give it a try, but I don't know I would purchase again.",3

Short Pique-Fleece Bassinet Liner/Skirt and Hood - Size: 16x32,"This is a beautiful bassinet cover at a fraction of the cost of most of them.  Also it has more style than many of them that just have acres of froo-frooey lace.  The only problem we had was determining the correct size to buy.  You almost have to do it by trial-and-error and since it's not an Amazon product we had to pay $11 shopping to rerurn the first one (almost 1/4 of the total price).  That said, we think it is sophisticated and charming and still economical.",4
Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,"I bought this pillow based on the high reviews.  It's not a bad pillow, but it definitely isn't as great as I was expecting!  The first couple weeks with it, it was amazing!  But then, all the fluff started to flatten and no matter how hard I try to fluff it back up, nothing seems to work.  Also, the top where you would put your head, the stuffing seems to be separating, so there's little to no support for your neck and head.  I started waking up with horrible headaches from bad support, so I have started using a thin pillow lain on top of the pregnancy pillow for extra support.  And I have tried to push the stuffing back together in that area, it doesn't work.  Overall, it's not a bad pillow, but not necessarily for the price.  It works good enough that I will continue to use it through the rest of my pregnancy.",3
Ring Snuggies ~ Ring Sizer / Assorted Sizes Adjuster Set of Six Per Pack,"I was glad to find these in assorted sizes and they've been useful on a couple different rings I have. However, on my everyday ring that I haven't gotten around to resizing, wearing a snuggie on it everyday causes the plastic to stretch a little and the opening widens - and then the snuggies to pop off and get lost. It's about 6 mos later and I've run out of snuggies! Still a good option for occasional wear, though, if you don't want to pay for resizing. At least it doesn't scratch the metal like the other kinds of guards do.",3
Phil and Teds Explorer Stroller with Doubles Kit- Apple/Black,I found this stroller to be very heavy and hard to fold. I had to ask my husband to unfold because it would not open for me because it was locked shut. I Do not like for the cost of this stroller that it does not come with a snack tray or a cup holder. I am Trying to return this item. It looks great but is not my go to stroller!,3
Chewy Stixx Oral Tubes Tough Bar---For children with aggressive biting habits.,"I got this for my 4 yr old son with autism. He tends to chew on everything... all day long: his sleeves, shirt collars, finger/nails to the blood, etc. I gave him one of my 2 year old's chew toys from when he was a baby, and my son went to town on it.We got this one and it works pretty well. It's very tough, yet cushy enough for chewing. It's just a little too thick for his little mouth. He may want to use it more as he gets older. We ended up getting the &#34;chewy tubes super chew knobby&#34; and it works better for him. Plus, we are able to tie a shoe string through the handle and he can wear it all day. So far, it's been 2 months and its still in good shape.",4
Naomi Home Deluxe Sleigh Glider and Ottoman Set Black/Mocha,"I really liked the look of this glider and the chair itself is comfortable. The complaints I have are:1. It took longer than expected to arrive. I kept getting emails further delaying when I could expect to receive the item. Granted, they did give me the option of cancelling my order, but I had spent so much time investigating the possible options before finally deciding on this one and I didn't want to start over.2. In retrospect, I wish I'd ordered a glider that came with a darker fabric. It's not terrible, but this one certainly does show dirt and you can't really clean it.3. My biggest complaint is the ottoman. It's several inches lower than the chair, which you can see in the picture, but which I didn't realize would be an issue. It was the first thing my friend commented on when she sat in it and, when I sat in hers (which has an ottoman that is about even with the chair), I realized how much more comfortable hers was. If I put a pillow on top of the ottoman, it's more comfortable.",3
"Nursery Fresh Refill for Diaper Genie 4 Pack, 1,088 Count",These refills are cheaper and there is not smell! We had a smell with the actual Diaper Genie brand but Nursery Fresh is definitely fresher. We'll buy these from now on.,5
DaVinci Full/Twin Size Conversion Rail Kit - Natural,"I had bought one of the convertible cribs for my son.  Finally, he was ready to convert to a full size bed.  The person who put my bed together ( it wasn't me.... ain't nobody got time for that!), put it together with relative ease.  The only thing that happened was that he put them on &#34;backwards,&#34; so when it was time to put the bed in, it did not fit.  Easily resolved!",5
Amberizon Baltic Teething Bracelet Honey Amber,"This FLEW off of my daughters wrist and ankles constantly.  It wound up getting lost at some point and I've since purchased a necklace instead.  If your child isn't wearing socks 24/7, this may be difficult to keep on them.",2
Manito Baby Shampoo Shower Hat / Cap / Visor / Shield (Kiwi / Green),"I am an adult with a 22 1/2&#34; head circumference (just for reference) and I bought this item because I get terrible ear infections and can not get water in my ears for the time my ears are infected/healing, and therefore cannot wash my hair when I am having problems with my ears. This item has been a god-send for me! It works great; it helps direct the flow of water over the visor and my ears completely! I can totally recommend this product and would be very willing to use it with children for eye protection. In fact, small children might feel better about using it if they saw an adult trying it out too.",5
The First Years Breastflow Starter Set,"We used this bottle system for our daughter from birth and loved it!  She had no problems going from breast to bottle and back, even after long periods on the breast.  We did have some small leakage problems if it wasn't screwed on really tight, but having an easy time getting her to drink from a bottle made it all worth the while.  We will be using these again for our next baby!Update 4/14/2012:Well, our next baby did not use these bottles.  We tried, but she just wouldn't use them at all.  Of course, she wouldn't take any bottle, so I don't know how much was a reflection on this brand and how much was just her picky nature.",4
Earlyears Fill n Fun Water Mat Toy,"I received this product to encourage my baby to enjoy tummy time and not only did it have one hole in it, but it had to leaks in it!  There are only two water mats made out there currently and I was severly disappointed that this is what we received!",1
Bellotte Designer Shopper Tote Diaper Bag in Ruby,"Thought I got a good deal for a designer diaper bag, my daughter is just 4 months and we a planning to replace it already.

Bought a pricey screen protector at best buy and then bought this just to find that a day or two later my screen protector was full or red spots. Good product for what its worth.,1
"Dappi Diaper Doublers, White","I bought these doublers for my 10-month old baby girl who had been soaking through all her cloth diapers. With these doublers, she can now go up to 2 or 2 1/2 hours in her diaper, instead of just 1 hour. These aren't absorbent enough for overnight, but work great during the day. And you can't beat the price!",5
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White","I didn't care for the instructions when I got the gate.  They seamed very complicated because there were only small pictures that explained how to put it together.  So... I just looked at how that gate should look on the packaging picture and was able to easily put it together. I also had to buy the extension piece and that was easy to install, too.  All I needed was a flat screwdriver.  I really like this gate because I was able to install it on the bottom of the stairs in our finished basement and I didn't need to make any holes in the wall.  Plus, it's very easy to open with one hand and looks nice. It's definitely tall enough to block my 16 month old daughter from going on the stairs yet it's short enough for me to even walk over it without having to open it.",5
Adventures in Bali Bib in Elephant Appliqu&eacute;,"I love Under The Nile products! I have purchased a very large number of their products since finding out almost nine months ago that we're expecting. The more I buy from them, the more I want to buy! This bib is so super cute and I'd had my eye on it for months! When I found it on sale, I just had to buy it and I am so glad that I did. It's so, so, so cute. Very soft, of course, because it's organic cotton. And, as with all of the Under The Nile products I've purchased, it appears to be very well made. I love the stretchy pull-over style neck on it. Highly recommended!",5
Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat in Regal,"I bought this car seat for my grandson.  I believe my daughter and son-in-law are very happy with the seat.  It is not one of those which is easy to move from vehicle to vehicle so they bought a less expensive one for me to use when I have the baby.  But all in all, it is a VERY safe and well made seat.  I would definately buy Britax Boulevard again.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"AND IT IS!  Sofie is soft, gnawable, and her belly sqeaks.  My 4.5 month old son likes to gnaw her hooves, try to tear her legs apart, and gun her ears.  Sofie and a wubbanub (and Peppa Pig TV) make our lives so much easier.",5
BabyMoon Pod - For Head Support &amp; Neck Support (Blue),My 4 month old was developing a flat spot on his noggin from sleeping on his back. I tried moving him but he favored sleeping on his right side. I got this pillow a couple weeks ago and I think it is helping. The spot hasn't gotten worse at least. I am still going to a specialist about the flat spot but this pillow is at least giving me peace of mind the problem isn't getting worse.Its a nice soft pillow too.,5
Funkoos Airplanes Organic Baby Sleep Gown:6 - 9 mon,"The Funkoos sleep gown cotton material is very soft and stays soft after washing.  The embroidery is a nice touch.

This easily fits an average size baby up to 12 months, maybe longer.",5

"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Rocket, Small",We use halo for our 7 month old so for our friend's baby shower I knew we had to get one.  Mom really only wanted organic cotton but because of how pretty it is think she will be fine with 100 percent. I love it.,5
Safety 1st Swing Shut Toilet Lock,"I have wasted more money on baby safety products than I even care to talk about.  This is the ONLY one I have found yet that truly works.

"Graco Classic Ride 50 Convertible Car Seat, Boyton","Our 18-month daughter needed a rear-facing carseat with more room than the Snugride 35 we had before.  This fits the bill perfectly.  She loved it the moment it came out of the box and seems to really enjoy car trips in it.It was reasonably easy to install with the LATCH system, although I had to prop up one end with some towels to get it to sit level enough.  The buckles and straps are very easy to handle and adjust, and the whole thing comes apart easily in case cleaning is necessary (I know this by personal experience in a story best left untold.)  The straps are plenty roomy to get a child in and out easily and quickly, even in a coat, and the straps are also really easy to loosen and tighten.We haven't been in an accident, so I can't say how well it would protect a child in that case. But from all appearances, it looks like it will do as well as anything else and better than most others.",5

Ameda White Valve - 2 Each,The valves don't come in the package as shown in the picture. These white valves are already defective when they arrived.It's a waste of money. I ordered 3 pairs!!

My oldest son is now able to reach the back of the driver seat and would often smear whatever he had on his shoes.  This definitely will prevent any permanent damage to the fabric of the seats.  I would recommend it 100%.  Besides all, it was surprisingly easy to install the Kick Mats.",5
The First Years 16 Piece Take &amp; Toss Infant Spoons,"Not sure why you would throw these away... Maybe if you're super rich and don't believe in washing, but these are great. And we throw them in the dishwasher every time. My son who is not even 18 months can use these and actually loves them, even if he can't scoop his food he likes to have it in one hand and eat with the other. Funny, cute stuff. I also throw these in my diaper bag when I know we'll be eating out so that he can have it at the restaurant as well. I would order these again if I ever lost all the spoons, but I don't see a shortage happening anytime soon.",5
Riley's Roses Window Treatment Panels by Sweet Jojo Designs - Set of 2,"Whether or not you are buying these window treatment panels to accompany the Riley's Roses toddler bedding set, these panels will add a soft, feminine touch to any girl's bedroom that she will completely adore. Delicate pink roses perfectly complimenting a trim of fresh-foliage green seem to instantly transform your daughter's room into an enchanting cottage garden.  I recently purchased these panels for my 2 1/2 year old, and she absolutely loves them.  I would definitely recommend these panels for any girl's room.",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"I have been eyeing this stroller for several months and finally bit the bullet and bought it this month.  My son, who is 17 months old, seems to really love this stroller (and he doesn't like most strollers)!  I purchased the red stripe color, and it is very sporty and cool looking.  The stroller handles and turns really smoothly.  I haven't had to deal with spills yet, but the fabric of the seat appears to be really easy to clean.  There is a decent size storage basket underneath the seat for jackets and a small diaper bag.  I don't know that I really care for the design of the cup holder (it's like a fanny pack design), but I do love that there is a zippered pocket for keys, phone, etc.  I bought a Brico snack pod to attach to the side of the stroller since there is no snack tray.  I will also add that I am 5'10, and the handle height is very comfortable for me.  The only thing I am considering modifying is the handles (perhaps adding bike tape to make them a little more comfortable).  Otherwise, I can't really complain about this great little stroller!",5
"Bamboobies Brahhh: Maternity, Sleep and Nursing&nbsp;Bra with Flower Accent (Large, Blackberry)",I purchased this item for my daughter who is pregnant.  She requested it and loves it.  I am very pleased!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"After all the 5 star reviews of the Vulli, I ordered this. I am an enthusiastic, older first time mom (after 4 years of infertility) meaning- I spare no expense on my daughter, but this was truly a waste of money. There are hundreds of other teethers that are far better construction, function, delight, etc. What a disappointment. The one salvation was that its cute- but for 20 bucks?!! A lot of overpriced nostalgia.",1

Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I bought this, and tried it out straight out of the box, and it worked perfectly. Then I sterilized all of the parts and tried again, and there was no suction. I took it apart and put it back together, but still nothing. After sterilizing all the parts, the pump simply would NOT work.",1
Philips AVENT Straw Cups 9oz 12m+ - Pink,"I ordered the 9 oz cups and got the 7 oz cups. I noticed it after i got it out of the box and so i couldn't return it. And I don't think the measurements on the cup are accurate( for a 4 oz measurement in my Pyrex measuring cup, the straw cup shows a 5 oz).I would say the pros of this cup areits easy to clean(compared to tommy tippee straw cups)it's leak proofits easy for my baby to drink by herself.The cons areit's kind of tricky to get the lid to open because just the part that covers the straw keeps rotating when you try to open it( even while you are pressing it on both sides as per the markings).The inner lid doesn't budge. I need to get the straw cover out to open the lid.Overall, it's an okay cup. I would have felt better if I had gotten the 9 oz cups that I had actually ordered.",3
Milkscreen: Home Test to Detect Alcohol in Breast Milk 8 Test Strips,"wasnt sure about these but thought I could try. I only wanted a drink EVERY NOW and then with my husband. so I bought these and still have most loll. but they work, only bad thing is if you use it and let it stand for the 2 minutes with ANY alcohol around it at all it will pick it up in the air, so it can give you a false result. but GRET product",5
Twooth Timer Twooth Timer,"I had high hopes that this timer would be a fun way to encourage my kids to brush longer!

Don't waste your time or money :(",1

"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","I ordered a med and a large, not sure what size I would need. I ended up keeping both because they are great wet bags- contain the smell and moisture no problem. The medium is the perfect size to send with her in her diaper bag for a full day of diapers. The large has a great snap handle that I have attached to her changing table that can easily hold a few days if you want. All in all, great wet bag!",5
"Delta Canton Full Size Wood Bed Rails, Black","Bought this to go with our crib which will turn it into a full-size bed.  They don't make the rails that match exactly to our crib and these were the closest.  Besides the fact that there will be a comforter covering the rails, they actually match really well and you can't notice they aren't an exact match.  We have the crib in chocolate and the rails we bought are espresso cherry.",4
Safety 1st Secure Lock Bed Rail,"We just put our 2.5 yr old in a twin bed. There are not alot of selection available in stores and I am familar with Safety 1st. This took maybe 10 minutes to assemble, no difficulties at all. When we put it on the bed, I will admit that it did take us awhile to figure out that you can extend the net to get the best fit on the mattress. Now figuring that out, it works great. The first night I slept with my daughter, leaned on the rail and everything and it stayed in tact!",5
"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black","This is a great idea and I can see how it would be convient to protect your seats but it doesnt work well if your seats in your car do not have a gap to slide the back of this into between the top and bottom part of the cars seat.  Otherwise good, my car seat base doesnt seem as solid with this under it.",4
"OXO Tot Roll Up Bib, Aqua","This bib does the trick for spills and the velcro around the neck is very secure around my 7 month old's neck.  Like other reviewers I agree this bib needs to be wider for the shoulders, but one is bound to get baby food somewhere, which is the ONLY negative about this bib. To catch those frontal spills, this bib can't be beat!!  This bib is way better than the baby bjoran, which I have for my 5 1/2 year old who still spills crumbs and rice.  The wipe off to this Oxo bib is easy and folding up for taking with is a breeze, worth the money spent, I bought a green one too and the colors are accurate to the photo listed.  Happy buying and enjoy! :-D",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Toddler Bed, Pink","You can not fault this bed, it opens and folds very quickly and easily, its a great size and very comfy. Our 3 year old loves sleeping on it, a definite must for those road trips when you don;t know what facilities will be available to you at your destination.",5
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"I did my research on a walker and decided on this one thankfully. The wheels move great. Very loose. If you get one and the wheels are tight, call Graco and have them replace it. It rolls well on carpet tile and pavement.I love the fact that it has the removeable noise making device with an ON/OFF switch. It takes 3 ""AA"" batteries. It can get dirty on the tray under the noise device too.My 4 mo. old son loves it. I love it. When I go to the gym, I throw it in the back of the truck. Then just take it out of the truck, put the boy in, and roll him right into the gym. He lets me run on the treadmill for an hour when he's in it. Very handy.",5
"Graco Sweet Snuggle Infant Soothing Swing, Jacqueline","We registered for this swing after hearing good reviews from other people and I figured the newer model would have more bells and whistles.  I'm giving it 5 stars due to easy assembly, as the baby hasn't gotten here yet (I'm due in 3 weeks -- and it's still easy to put together) but I anticipate it will do the job it needs to do, which is to hold the baby comfortably for a little while.",5
Graco Swingomatic 6 Speed Swing - Windsor,"I am a first time mother. One thing that I have learned is never to pick something beacause you like the pattern. I love the Windsor pattern, so I figured I would register for all of the items in Windsor print. I recevied them all. The item I like the least is the swing. It wasn't exactly easy to put together. The mobile was the hardest part. Once you think you get it on, it just keeps falling off. I got so aggravated, I just gave up and kept the mobile off. When my six month old son falls asleep his head always ends up falling to the side or in his lap, no matter how far it is reclined and even with the head insert in. It sure isn't a quiet swing, it makes a clicking noise everytime it goes back and forth. It goes through batteries like crazy. My son has learned to unhook the tray and when he does he just about falls out. I'm not happy with it at all. The only reason I gave it two stars is because the pattern is very nice. I went and bought the linkadoos take along swing, which I love and am completely satisfied with. Never register for an item or buy an item just because you like the pattern and want a matching set, you may end up with something you hate :)",2
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,"My daughter received this booster seat for her 3rd  birthday and I think it's wonderful.  Every other booster seat I've seen has to be strapped to the chair, which allows crumbs and other food pieces to accumulate under it, and has to be unbuckled every time you need to clean under it.  The Cooshie is made of a non-skid material and stays put on the chair.  Since it doesn't have straps, it becomes very easy to free up the chair for visitors, when necessary, without worrying that there's a pile of crumbs (or worse) underneath.  It's also easy to take this booster to restaurants or other places (it comes with a clear plastic travel bag).  Other boosters tend to be made of hard plastic and can scratch the chair it's attached to.  We have oak chairs, so this was a problem for us.  The Cooshie's soft foam material does not scratch or leave other marks.  At 3 years old, my daughter was at the point where she was too big for the high chair.  She enjoys sitting at the table, but she's just not big enough to reach without kneeling (and she's not yet graceful enough to sit on a chair without taking a tumble every now and then).  The Cooshie raises her high enough without constraining her yet keeps her in a stable sitting position so she doesn't fall or slip off the chair.  It seems to be very durable too.  My 14-month old has 8 front teeth &amp; is currently teething.  He tried to take a  bite out of the Cooshie and didn't even leave a mark!  The only drawback I can see is that my daughter needs to be helped into and out of her seat.  When she was just kneeling on a chair, she was able to climb onto the chair by herself.  A little bit of a damper on her autonomy, but I think the safety and comfort of this booster make it well worth it.  I would continue to use a high chair or a booster with straps for a child who is too young or wreckless to wait for assistance in getting in/out.",5
"Joovy Tricycoo Tricycle, Greenie",My daughter loves it! I would have preferred the bike to have a seatbelt though.,4
Harlow 5 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set with Bumper by Cocalo Couture,"This bed set was a great buy. It is perfect for the person looking for something that is not pink, purple or pastel. The colors look even better in person than they do online. I just wish I could find the matching hamper to go along with the set.",5
"Status Veneto Glider and Nursing Ottoman, White/Beige","This glider seems to be an okay, value driven, piece of furniture.  It does not have the bells and whistles of the other gliders (reclining or locking), but it does have a nursing footstool. It was very easy to put together, I am 8 months pregnant and did it myself in under 20 minutes. Day 2 out of the box it does squeak at a certain point, but I have to try to make it do that, so as long as it doesn't get worse, it will be fine (famous last words, I know). Our nursery is small and this glider fits great.  It is a bit narrower than others but I fit comfortably and can rest my head on the back (pre-prego size 12, 5'6&#34;).",3
"Munchkin Auto-Close Metal Gate, White","In order for this gate to fit stairwells that are greater than a certain width (somewhere around 33""), you have to remove some corner-pieces from inside each corner of the frame, so that additional pieces that are included can be installed to extend it. The removed corner-pieces are then re-inserted. You are expected to pry them out with a screwdriver, and edges in said pieces are provided to offer leverage. The top-corner ones are a cinch. The problem is that the bottom corner ones on mine were wedged in super-tight, and the force/leverage necessary to remove them made the plastic crumble like cold butter when I tried to follow the instructions and pry them out. The edge they provide for leverage literally crumbled to mush on me. When I tried other angles, same thing: again, it was like they used cold butter (trust me, the analogy is dead on) for these plastic pieces. They just disintegrate.I stopped right their. If this is indicative of the sort of design forethought and build quality that went into this gate, it's too dangerous for my child. It makes me a bit ill to think that this sort of junk is permitted on the market for a CHILD SAFETY PRODUCT.Read the other 1-star and 2-star reviews...these plastic pieces seem a common problem, especially if you have to use the extenders like I did. But I'd still warn against this gate even to those who can skip this step, because it's these same pieces that help anchor the gate. Imagine if they gave out when your child was around it.",1
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I really needed something to warm my baby's bottle without using the stove or microwave. This was to my surprise faster and easier than any of the two, makes my job a lot easier. I would recommend to busy mothers everywhere.",5
Chuggington Toddler Bedding Set - 4pc Ride Rails Comforter Bed Set,"My 3.5-year-old loves this bed set! Compared to the Thomas the Engine bedding set I got from Wal-Mart (which I love just as much), this one is softer and feels better against the skin, more like cotton and less like polyester. I didn't give it 5 stars because the sheet is already getting those little balls of thread on it that cheap sheets tend to get, and the blanket is too big for a toddler bed, IMO. It makes it hard to make the bed and have it look nice. However, the size is perfect for wrapping up a little kid who wants to feel safe and warm. So, it's not a bad size at all. Just be prepared to fold an end in if you're a perfectionist like me and want to make a nice tailored looking bed. (I have the Orbelle 3-6T toddler bed.)",4
Ikea Baby Bib Set with Sleaves-kladd Prickar,"I have a 2.5 yo and a 15 months old. I was so sick of stains on my kids shirts from eating fruit, that I finally looked into sleeved bibs. There are several options out there, but these are by far the cheapest, in fact, they are half the price. True, they are not really waterproof, but my kids clothes are not getting stained anymore (my main concern is staining, not necessarily getting a little wet). And I can't say that the clothes get all that wet, just slightly around the neckline. Other people mentioned that the material around the sleeves and neckline is stretchy fabric and not at all waterproof, and that is true. The way I have dealt with that is to fold the sleeve once over itself to reveal the actual bib fabric and then there is more protection against wetness. Also, you can wash them by hand and they will be dry by the next mealtime! There is no perfect bib out there, but I have to say these work well and I'm happy with the price. I'm getting another set.",5
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish",I really like this bath pad. My little guy nestles nicely into it and I don't have to worry about him sliding around on it. It's also nice because I can spray it with warm water before I put him on it and it will retain the warmth so it's not a cold shocker on him. Has a nice plastic hanger on the top that is great for hanging it on the shower curtain rod to dry. You really do have to be diligent about drying it and letting all of the surfaces to be exposed to air otherwise it will mold but it can be thrown in the washing machine too.,5

Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Deluxe Musical Mobile Gym,"Received as a gift with no gift receipt, so I'm stuck with it.  It has 3 settings: music, music + lights, and music + mobile spins.  Unfortunately, from the very first time I used it the music had a static sound that went along with it.  It distorts the music and unfortuantely you can't use the mobile or lights without music so you have to listen to the static to let the child see the lights or mobile work.  It's infuriating that someone paid a lot of money for this to give us a really nice gift and it's a piece of junk.  Also, the hanging monkey pieces are way too heavy and come apart too easily and fall on my son's head.  The hippo piece is also too hard and like the monkeys gives him a shock when he hits himself with it.  Buy something else.",1
"Baby Starters Plush Snuggle Buddy, Blue Monkey",I bought this for my 3 year old and she loves it. She calls it her &#34;soft baby&#34;. It would be great for a younger baby as well.,5
"Summer Infant Secure Surround Play Safe Play Yard, Tan","I bought the Summer Infant Secure Surround Play Safe Play Yard for our daughter who is turning 10 months old next week. It's a great product, high quality but she hates it. I think it's because she's been moving around so freely for a few months now and for us to now try to ""contain"" her isn't working. We'll just continue to baby proof the house and keep and eye on her.",5
"3 Sprouts Storage Bin, Monkey",Great bin! Solid and good size. Fits a lot of toys and looks beautiful.Highly recommend it to anyone looking to organize.,5
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","Never have I had such a problem setting something up - I eventually gave up.  The gate is at an angle, so only if you do it just right will it be able to open and close.  Plus you have to use stickers (suppied) for it to stick to the wall. Give me an order baby gate anytime!",1
Dora the Explorer Toddler Nap Mat Pink,"this was so cute online but it it pretty flimsy, wish had more padding and the pillow was better",3
Gerber Nuk Newborn Orthodontic Pacifier Latex Size1 - 2 ea-Colors Vary,"if you pull the nipple all the way to the sides, out will come a collection of 'things' from hair to lint to dry milk...one day while cleaning one of the pacifiers I noticed a piece of hair stuck to the base of the nipple, when I pulled the nipple to the side, the hair still wouldn't come off, so I pulled it really hard and along with the hair came a string of lint...I did the same thing to the other 3 pacifiers and found them dirty as well...since then I kept an eye on these nipples and noticed that even within a few hours of use, it still collected lint and other things...... I regularly would boil the pacifiers and wash around the base of the nipple, but this isn't enough for these pacifiers...I am sending these nipples back to the company for my $$ back...don't buy these unless you are willing to constantly keep washing them within a few hours throughout the day...",1
One Dozen (12) Armed Forces Rubber Duck Party Favors,"Good product and relatively inexpensive.  The three sets of four were all in good shape although there were a couple where the painted eyes were off a bit (googly eyes!), but I'm happy with the purchase and the price I paid.",4
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","This is the second one we've purchased. Have tried others, but this is the most versatile and comfortable. It even works well with a two year old - very helpful when traveling with multiple children!",5
Safety 1st Secure Lock Bed Rail,"I bought two guard rails for my 17 month old son who was being transitioned into a twin bed. I have one rail on each side of the bed because his bed is centered in the middle of his room. I had no problem locking the 4 rails (2 per each guard rail) with the exception of 1 and my neighbor was able to help me. I am 6 months pregnant and my husband is gone with the army so I tend to buy things that are easy to assemble and work good without a hassle. This was definately one of those items. It was easy to assemble, they are easy to adjust and lower, and they are safe for my child since they meet the new standards to prevent entrapment. You can't beat that! Lowering the rails to change the bed sheets is easy to do and I have never had a problem lowering or relocking the rails. I follow the directions and nothing on these rails has ever broken. The amount of space on the mattress taken up by the rails is very minimal and I can easily lay on the bed with my son and have extra room even though I'm 6 months pregnant and it's only a twin bed. Last but not least, the guard rails keep my son in bed and never move even though they take a beating from him. Every time I check on him, he is always pushed up against one and the guard rails have never budged. I love knowing he is safe, won't get entrapped like with the possibility of the older model guard rails, and that the product is easy to use. I would recommend it to anyone.",5
"Gerber Birdseye 10 Count Flatfold Cloth Diapers, White","I purchased these for my daughter in law to use as burp clothes, and when they arrived I had to laugh!  These things look like cheese cloth. They are so thin you can see right through them! On a good note, they make great dusting rags.",2
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","These door monkeys are genius, kudos to the person who invented these.We used to have problems with our 2 yr old getting into our bedroom and bathroom tearing everything apart.Thanks to the door monkey she can look longer get into those rooms anymore!As a bonus it keeps unwanted pets out as well.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My daughter continues to love this toy at 4 months. When she was a newborn, she took notice of this toy because of the black and white patterns on the back of his wings. It was actually the only toy that seemed to attract her attention at such a young age. Well, at about 2-3 months, she was able to reach out and grab the wings and little arms. I found it fascinating to watch her curl her little fingers around all the different parts. I thought by now she'd be bored of it, but I was wrong. Now at 4 months she's grabbing the rings and teether and putting them in her mouth. She also loves when I squeak the squeaky toy.I highly recommend this toy because it seems to captivate babies at many ages. Just a note, it is quite large and doesn't hang well from my Graco Tour Infant seat (blocks her whole face). However, it attaches very well to her bouncy seat!",5
Baby Aspen Pig-n-A Blanket 2-Piece Gift Set,Item arrived on time and better quality than I expected. Will be gift to baby on the way and we are very pleased with purchase.,5
North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,"I've bought and am using two other North States Gates and both are excellent, probably a 4 out of 5: North States Supergate Extra Tall Easy Close Gate, and Supergate Deluxe D&eacute;cor Metal Gate. This gate however is junk.It's incredibly difficult to use. Pehaps if you get lucky, and your walls are just the right size, you can open and close it with one hand easilly, but I discovered if you want to get the gate to close securely without your little one pushing it over, you not only need both hands, you need to get down on the floor and wrestle with it for some time. What a huge disappointment! Once installed, and we realized it was useless, taking it down ended up leaving a damaged wall, as the double sided foam tape behind the plastic mounting cup ripped a chunk of paint off of the wall...nice. What a mistake to buy this junky gate. Perhaps if you need to get a gate up and never open it, this gate would work for you. If not, look elsewhere.",1
Medela Contact Nipple Shield - Standard Size (24mm),"Was hoping to use this to entice baby to latch on, but it didn't work as expected. It was just awkward and didn't work in the way I had expected it to. This was my experience.",3
"Wee Gallery Art Cards for Baby, Sea Collection","These cards are wonderful for young babies. My baby started looking at these at around 6 weeks old- long before he was interested in any toys. We hung them up over his changing table and he was totally mesmerized. They are perfect for bringing along when you leave the house to keep small babies entertained. They hardly take up any room in a diaper bag or purse. At 2 or 3 months, my baby would happily stare at them through a whole meal at a restaurant. Now, at 4 months, he likes to pick them up and chew on them. They are holding up amazingly well. They're made out of a thick sturdy cardboard, like board book pages. I highly recommend these.",5
"Tadpoles Four Bulb Chandelier, Pink","Everything we expected, looks great in our daughters room and produces plenty of of light.Came with everything we needed to install.",5
"Pacipals Huggable Pacifier (Briar the Bunny) --- **UPDATED PACKAGING, SAME GREAT PRODUCT**","Pacimals are lifesavers!!!! My daughter absolutely loves hers. We have 2 pacimals (the bunny and the hippo) and I don't know what I would do without them. The fact that she can hug her bunny and hold on to her pacifier makes it so easy! I don't have to worry that the paci will fall out of her mouth and constantly have to put it back in like other pacifiers. She can do it herself and has been able to do so since she was 1 month old. I constantly get stopped on the street by other mothers and asked where I purchased it. Now, this is a gift I give to every expectant mother.",5
"Kissaluvs Diaper Lotion Potion 4 oz. Squirt Bottle, Concentrate","I purchased this for making a wipe solution, as we cloth diaper and cloth wipe 100%.  Being exclusively breastfed, my baby poops a lot and his little bottom was staying slightly red.  The first time we used this product it immediately cleared up and has been fine since! This solution smells wonderful too.  I will definitely buy more, but I do think the price is a bit high.",4
DEX Products Safety Changing Pad,"This change pad has a pattern all over it which is made up of lots of little grooves. When your baby has a particularly messy nappy and it gets on the pad (it happens!!) then the poop collects in the little grooves and requires scrubbing with a brush to get out. A simple spray and wipe down doesn't suffice and who has time for unnecessary scrubbing when you have a new baby??Also, the plastic surface is very thin and knocking it with my fingernails which aren't even long causes it to tear easily.Yes I could probably buy a cover for it, but it should still be acceptable to use without one, otherwise why sell it like that?I really do not recommend this changing pad at all.",1
SAFETY KNOTTED &amp; CERTIFIED*Amber Heals Baltic Amber Teething Necklace-Raw Honey- with &quot;Amber Heals&quot; Jewelry Pouch,Boys hardly know the necklace is there and we're trusting it does what is claimed. Definitely no harm in trying natural remedies. Hasn't irritated son's eczema either.,5
Piyo Piyo Free Rotate Bottle Scrubber,Broke the first time we used it. Great idea if it had worked.  Seven more words required - don't have any.,1
Lamaze: Pupsqueak the Puppy,"Right around the age of three months, my daughter started to really become interested in the things around her, and Pupsqueak was no exception!  She absolutely loves this toy and we take it everywhere we go.  I can lay her on the floor with this and she will move it back and forth, grab at it, and pull the ring into her mouth.  She absolutely loves the sound the ears make.  A great toy to teach your child grasping!",5
Sunshine Kids Mighty Tite Seat Belt Tightener,"No matter how much I fooled with the little metal thing that came with the carseat, it never seemed tight enough and it was hard to do.  With the mighty tight, you just snap it on and crank it tight.  The seat is in so tight now that it doesn't budge.  I love it so much that I give these as baby shower gifts.  Highly recommend!!",5
Levana BABYVIEW20 Interference Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby Camera,The unit works just as advertised.  The included AC adapters are great so your not replacing batteries all the time.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Baby shows absolutely no interest in this toy.  Refuses to put it in mouth even though likes gumming on just about everything else.  The giraffe has a chalky rubbery texture so I can understand why.  We use it as a squeeker.  I like that it is made in France.,2
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,I like the size of these blankets but they are not as soft as I thought they would be. I found a off brand set at the store that were so much softer and half the price.,3
"Stork Craft Hillcrest Fixed Side Convertible Crib, Espresso",Love this crib. Looks exactly like it does in the photo and it was very easy to assemble. Great value for the price.,5
"Maxi Cosi Rodi AP Booster Car Seat, Origami Rose","The plastic material used on this seat feels a little cheap, but it also makes the seat light and easy to install. This is a great option for putting in and out of cars, whereas my Graco Argos is heavy and more difficult to remove. Also, this Maxi Cosi allows for a highback booster option of up to 120 lbs (weight of child) whereas the Graco Argos highback option only goes up to 100 lbs.Keep in mind that this seat uses your automobile's buckle system. It doesn't have one of its own. That means, for most cars, you need to install it on one side of the automobile or the other -- not the center/middle. The negative with this is that the center provides the most safety should there be an accident; side impacts are less likely to reach that far into the cab. For example, if you have the booster installed on the passenger side of the car, and someone rams into the passenger side, there's more of a chance your child will be injured. For this reason, I prefer using a car seat that has it's own buckle system so that I can keep it in the center -- but even those only go up to about 65 lbs (weight of child) before you need to start using the automobile's buckle system. That said, the Maxi Cosi does provide some side impact protection even if it is not installed in the center of the car, which is safer than having none.If you want a seat that says in the car permanently, and takes advantage of the center of the vehicle, something like the Graco Argos is a more durable option. But if you want something that you can easily put in and take out of the car, or swap in and out of more than one car, the Maxi Cosi is a good choice.",4
"Playtex Disney Playhouse Insulator Cup, 9 Ounce, Colors and Styles May Vary","Adorable little cups.... I love these cups! I used them for my daughter and now for my son and they are perfect easy to drink out of, they don't leak (which is a plus), and they last a long time even after multiple throws and drops! A++++",5
MOBI TykeLight Green,"I wanted to rate this product with five stars.  My six month old does love the glow of the light, and I find it fun myself.  However, I thought I was ordering the unit with the base, as that was what was pictured.  I was very disappointed to find that I received the one that plugs directly into the unit.  I emailed Beach Audio to find out why I got the wrong one.  They discovered that there is a mix up with listing and picture.  I was told that it will be fixed with Amazon, and I was offered a postage paid return label for shipping it back.  I am choosing to keep the light I have.  Be aware of that one detail, but if something does go wrong, the people at Beach Audio will take care of it!  :)",4
Carter's I Love My Mom Baby Boy's Bear Blankie,"All that matteres is that my baby girl likes it, no difference if it's for a boy or girl, she don't know gender or color difference yet, so it was perfect for her, she sleeps with it all the time.",4
"Safety 1st Complete Air Protect 65 Convertible Car Seat, Great Lakes","I had owned a Britax carseat and was prepared to purchase Britax again.  After taking a look at this carseat I decided to purcahse two of these instead.  I am very pleased with the quality and the ease of installation.  My granddaughters (ages 2 and 4) are both very comfortable in the seats. I have, thankfully, not had the ultimate test of any carseat, which would be an accident.  My experience with this seat has been positive and I would buy these again.",5
"Carter's Burp Cloths, Mommy Loves me Yellow","Our baby wasn't a hugh spitter-upper. We love these burp cloths. They are so sturdy, and comfy on the skin too. They really held up over many washes. If we had a baby who spat up more we might opt for something that was larger, but they were perfect for us.",5
"Badger Basket Two Hamper Set with Liners, Natural","I needed a garbage can in the kitchen that would look nice sitting out. I could have gotten the wood one and paid 2 to 3 times as much for one! I have a regular kitchen can inside the larger basket for the kitchen. The prior reviews about it being cheaply made are not accurate. These are baskets, and as such not like iron, but it is a sturdy basket with a nice lid! Perfect for my needs!",5
Cotton Tale Designs Paradise 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"I looked everywhere for this bedding.  Everyone that sold it was selling out very very fast! Found and bought it from Amazon, and it was shipped very quick!  The packaging was great and the bedding was beautiful!  We are having a boy and loved this!  Such vibrant colors and just gorgeous!!!  Cannot wait to set it up in the crib next month!!!!",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","The Baby Bjorn gets rave reviews for good reason.  It is a great product - don't be fooled by imitators.  I tried others with my first child and hated them.  They were too difficult to get on and to get the baby into and not particularly comfortable on my back and shoulders.  The Baby Bjorn on the other hand is awesome!  The design makes it relatively simple to load your baby in and the crisscross back with adjustable slide is about as comfortable as you can get.  I also love my sling but there are times when the Bjorn is just more practical.  Like when dashing through airports making connecting flights.  And wandering through tiny shops where a stroller won't fit.  And it was very handy keeping my son secured to me when we went elephant trekking in Thailand.My toddler is probably pushing it for the weight limit but I still occasionally use it and he is now 16 months old and 26 pounds.  (Some versions have 22 lb weight limits but others (mine included) are a bit higher.)  Carrying around a 26 pound baby isn't the most comfortable thing in the world no matter how you do it but this carrier sure makes it easier.  Best of all, in spite of being a curious and active wandering toddler he actually still enjoys being in it on those occasions when I do need to use it.It may seem expensive compared to other brands but buy a Baby Bjorn carrier.  It is definitely money well spent!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie the Giraffe is the perfect teething toy. She is soft, makes squeaky sounds in both her head and body, and is just right for tiny little fists. My son loves to chew on her ears, horns, and legs. The day she arrived he was cutting a new tooth and just gnawed her a ton. She is really well made, and my older children love to play with her too. When I ask them to get my son a toy, they always pick Sophie. The only downside to Sophie is the cost. I priced out a number of other teething toys, and Sophie was definitely one of the most expensive. After having Sophie for a month though, I would still recommend her. She is worth the price and is one of the few toys that we have that are actually worth what we paid for them.",5
Disney Car's &quot;Little Racer&quot; Musical Mobile,"I read some of the reviews so I knew people said it looked a little cheap. I think the plastic feels a little cheap but once I put it together, which I was scared I would break it I had to be forceful to get get it together. But once it was together and I put it on the Crib I did like the look of it and it looks so cute with the bedding and matching Wall decals I bought :)",4
Single Animal Jingle Bell (Assorted Styles),Brought for 3 years old grandchildren. We have started our own marching band. Quality was excellent and it was a teaching tool as well.,5
"Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat, Lamont",I wished I could sit in the chair. It seems very comfortable for my toddler and easy to strap into the car. Was a bit pricey to clear in customs but that may have been due to the country I reside in. The cost on Amazon itself was very reasonable.,4
Infant Carseat Canopy Cover 3 Pc Whole Caboodle Baby Car Seat Cover Kit Cotton C030100,Absolutely loved it. It was just like picture! The material was very nice. I would recommend I you are looking for a stylish cover!!,5
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow",We co-sleep and use these in bed so that if the babies have an accident it doesn't ruin our sheets. We also use them on the changing pad so that we don't have to change the entire cover every time there's a messy diaper and we use them when we visit my parents and need to put the kids down on their nice sofa or rug. We have about 10 of these so that we don't run out and they are fantastic.,5
Monthly Baby Stickers Monthly Tie Stickers Boy Necktie Neck Tie UNCUT Nautical Sailor Boat Anchor Plaid Argyle Stripes Waves Plaids,These bowties are a cute and unique twist on the popular monthly stickers for babies.  The sticker works well and look super cute on my little man.  My only complaint is that a couple of the stickers are hard to read with the color of the font and the background design.,4
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","I'm on my third kid and 5th diaper pail.  My fourth pail was a Diaper Genie Elite that worked great until my son shoved his hand into the inside of the pail and broke a piece of it, and it no longer opened with the foot pedal.  I replaced it with the same pail (Diaper Genie Elite), and this one doesn't seem to have the same odor protection as my last one.  No idea why.  I hate that you have to buy the bags for this (unless you do a hack, which I've heard does not offer the same odor protection at all).  I used a Diaper Champ for a few years and this is far better.  It's easy to use, easy to change, seems to fill up pretty quickly because the bags are so narrow, but from my experience, this is the best pail to keep stink out of your nursery, and messes contained to ONLY the plastic diaper pail lining.  The others have a plastic &#34;pass through&#34; that the diaper touches before going in to plastic, which obviously gets dirty after some poop-splosion clean up jobs.  And Costco now carries the refill bags for less money than Amazon ;)",4
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet, Celery","This sheet is too small for my Da Vinci mini crib.  Also, the material is very thin. I do not recommend these sheets.",1
"Kaboost Portable Chair Booster, Green","This was a gift;  The concept is cool, but it did not work well with our wood floors (kids could not 'scoot' kaboosted chair in and out) and their legs were squished between the chair (normal dining set) and table 'ledge' (which is less than 4"" tall).  Ages 2 and 4.",2
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog",Love this little bag - my son adores it! The only thing I would change is to have a toggle on the outside drink pocket for tightening as well as to add a double zipper on the main compartment.....I really find single zippers a pain in the butt!,3
DaVinci Sleepwell Twilight 6-Inch Ultra Firm Deluxe Crib Mattress,It's firm enough for my baby which I was looking for. It fits the crib right and I am happy with it until now.,5
"NUK Gerber Graduates Learning System Sports Learning Cup Tumbler, Baseball, 9-Ounce",Bought it for my 15 month old. Still his favorite after 3 months. He knew right away where the spout was. Best part ... They dont leak. I can leave water in it in his crib and not come back to a puddle.,5
Knickernappies Doorknob Diaper Pail (celery),The snaps that are supposed to go above the door knob already gave out under the weight of one child's couple days worth of diapers. But I have figured out how to snap it a different way so the outer snaps are above the door and bear the weight. Overall it isn't a bad product...but it could be a bit sturdier for it's purpose...if the other snaps fail I'll just use it in a pail.,3
"Kushies &quot;On the Go&quot; 2 Pack Wet Bag, Green  (Patterns and Colors May Vary)","These wetbags are not great.  They seep moisture, and they only fit about 3 or 4 cloth diapers in them.  I wasn't upset by the small size, because I thought they would be great for my diaper bag... until I used them and they leaked right through.  I would not recommend these for wet diapers. I also got a PlanetWise wetbag, and it is AWESOME! Check those out instead!",2
Slip-X Solutions Tub Tattoos: Clownfish,Super whimsical characters. I bought all the series and love it. Very colorful! This will even give me spares should any peel up. So far standing up to hundreds of showers and lots of cleanings. Don't use a scrub brush cleaning these or risk peeling them up! A good firm sponge works just fine,5
Dr. Brown's Bottle Brush,"I see where people had a lot of issues and I barely purchased one because of them but I actually Love the brush. Mine has not torn up at all, I like the sponge tip for the bottom of the bottle floor. Especially for breastmilk which has a lot of fat... If you get a brush with a prickly brush head and not a sponge... then it misses areas on the bottom of the bottle floor. It will stay greasy no matter what liquid you use.. By the way, Palmolive Baby works magic and leaves the bottles squeaky clean.For hygiene purposes I switch my brush out monthly as I wash several bottles daily... I also ""after"" it dries out, I use a zip lock bag on the tip of it to keep it sterile.Palmolive Ultra, Baby Bottle, Toy, & Dish Wash Liquid 20 fl oz (591 ml)",5
"NUK Transparent Silicone BPA Free Pacifier, Size 2, 2 Pack","My son loves this pacifier.. he will not take anything but this one. Not even the other nuk ones. It is not sold  in stores which is a bit of a headache. You can only find them on amazon. Also they do blend into the background , which can make it hard to find in the middle of the night, but it does look better because it is clear. It matches every outfit.",5
Cribskirt Tailored Dust Ruffle 14 inches long 100% cotton WHITE,"Ordered the nice, clean white.  Arrived as described.  Looks great in a modern nursery because of its clean lines.  No frilly, lacey, ruffly stuff to deal with.  No complaints.",5
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"I received a confirmation 2 days after ordering this product that it had ""shipped."" Two weeks later, it still hadn't arrived. I called Medical for You (the distributor) and they said they'd get back to me. Two days later, I got an email telling me it was on back order. All in all, it took over 3 weeks to get this product. My baby was barely crawling when I first paid for it, and was all over the place by the time I got the play yard. If you get this product, you might try purchasing it straight from Regalo (the manufacturer).That being said, the product itself is great. After reading reviews of other play yards, it seemed like plastic ones had some safey issues (ex: being too light and tipping over, falling apart easily, etc.), so I went with the metal one. So far, it has been worth the money. There's a lot of room for my 7 month old to roll and crawl around. I can get in there with her and we have plenty of room to play. It's sturdy and I never worry that it will tip over or collapse, even when she rolls into the side of the play yard. The door on the side is a great feature, because I don't have to step over the top to get in. It is fairly large, so you may not want this product if you have a small living room (or small space wherever you plan to set it up).Over all, I would completely recommend this product to parents looking to keep their mobile babies safe in a confined but spacious area. I just hope nothing breaks, because I'd have to deal with their customer service again :(",4
Parking Pal Car Magnet - Parking Lot Safety for Children (Flower Pal),"I have a 3 year old and 4 year old and I've always been concerned about them listening in the parking lot.  I've been lucky that they usually listen very well and we hadn't had any problems...until last week when it was windy and something blew out of the car into the parking lot and my 3 yo ran after it to get it for me!  Luckily there were no cars at the moment but it definitely put me in panic mode!  After calming down I thought I needed a new way to keep them together so we didn't have any repeats of the other day!I got my parking pal a few days ago and tried it out for the first time today!  My kids loved it!  Instead of fighting over who got in the car first they were fighting over who got to ""play the game""!  They literally wanted to stop at more stores so that they would each get turns doing it!  They loved telling me the animals and colors on the parking pal and keeping their hand right on the hand spot while I put the other one in the car!  My youngest even said, ""Mommy, it's so cool"" :)I would highly recommend this product to other moms with toddlers and will be ordering another one so that I can have one on each side of the car instead of having to remember whose turn it is!",5
Kidco Universal Outlet Cover,"The product does not lie flush with the wall, meaning that your plugs (unless they happen to have really, really long prongs - which none of mine did) will not be able to reach deeply enough to get power.  Get the Mommy's Helper Safe Plate instead.  That one actually works.",1
Eddie Bauer Harness Buddy,"This very funny monkey, sent very fast, and is a joy for my grandson and me - for him as a pet, for me guiding him safe in the city. He, as a vivid toddler is running very quickly, and I as a more slow walker can hold him  secure, when he wants to reach the interesting cars on streets and roads, without knowing about any danger.  May be some people think, that I am &#34;gaga&#34; holding him in such a way,  older people show sympathy and understanding...At home the little boy often caresses this smiling soft animal with likeness.Thank you so much !",5
Sliding Door Locks,"These have worked well to keep our twin toddlers from opening the sliding closet doors.  Our childcare provider, on the other hand, has broken two of them because she forces the doors without thinking about pushing the wings in.  Fortunately, they still work with only one wing!  For those who have bad reviews, I wonder if the wings were on backward.  Notice the direction of the straight vs angled sides.  Also, I'd suggest using a better adhesive for longevity.  We'd buy again; in fact, we have already.",4
"Status Series 300 Combo Storage Unit, Mahogany",Furniture arrived with no problems. Very little to assemble. Doors didn't quite fit perfectly but everything else works great! Just the right height to put a changing station on top - plenty of room. Matches crib perfectly.,5
"Tadpoles Multi-Layer Tulle Curtain Panel, White",They are see through so keep that in mind. We liked them a lot though. My daughter really thought they were cool,5
Baby Care Play Mat - Pingko Friends (Large),"This playmat is awesome! Super cute, easy to clean and provides the best protection for your little ones!! Adding this to your baby's room will automatically brighten it up and the room will look so cute! This type of playmat is very popular with Koreans and since I am Korean, I knew I would eventually buy one of these when I got pregnant. I was honestly skeptical about the Pingko mat because it is so much cheaper compared to the other brands I have seen at the store. A normal mat like this would cost around $160. So naturally, I went out to the Korean store and bought one for $160 because I assumed this mat was inferior due to the price. Stupid assumption! Couple of months later, I decided I wanted another mat for the living room but didn't want to shell out the $160 so I ordered this. I knew this mat was slightly smaller but that was fine since it was an extra mat. I have to say, the colors and pictures on this are so vibrant and much cuter than the first one I bought! Wish I had tried this first! The size difference is hardly noticeable. I honestly couldn't tell that this was smaller just by looking at it. Please don't hesitate and try it!P.S. - My mat did have a smell when it arrived and it drove me crazy. A week later, the smell was still there and I was debating if I should return it. I took it outside, washed it with laundry detergent and water, dried it in the sun and the smell disappeared completely. I was shocked. I thought the smell would come back after a day or two but it didn't. It got rid of it 100%. Since the smell is gone, I am completely satisfied with this product.",5
"Jahgoo Bath Support Baby Bath Seat, Lime",I ordered this for my friend for her baby. It came and I almost laughed at the size of the box. This this is so small that yes it works for a new born but if your baby is over 7 lbs it wont work for long! It looks very neat but is not practcle for long.,2
"Graco Sweet Slumber Sound Machine, White","We had originally used a different brand infant sound machine with our daughter, and searched for something better because it had several issues, including all but one awful &#34;white noise&#34; sounds, volume control, no power outage backup, and no way to tell if the timer button had been pushed, either accidentally by us or on purpose by our daughter (meaning several nights of us having to sneak in and turn it back on after it had shut off). This sound machine completely solved all of those issues--awesome, true white noise sounds that seem soothing, quality controls, and battery backup. The blue light it emits isn't too bright for our daughter's room, although we choose to not use the night-light function for now. A couple of the white noises are more nature oriented, one with a whale sound and the other with crickets. Although an adult may find this soothing, we don't think they would be to our toddler, so we don't ever use those. The music option is nice, offering classical music we can listen to while winding down for bedtime after bath. The auxiliary jack is great, too, but we rarely use it because that would mean making sure the iPod is charged...not a priority for us at the time, but a nice option, nonetheless.",5
Ubooly iPhone and iPod Interactive Pet,"We all know how kids love cute little things that are cuddly and that they can pretend are their very own ""pets"". We also know how much kids love technology and are constantly begging to use our iPhones or iPads. So I was very excited when I heard about this adorable new fuzzy guy... Ubooly!Ubooly came with instructions on how to download the Ubooly app to your iPhone or iTouch device and a code to enter to activate your new little ""buddy"". After that you just insert your device into the plush character and zip it up. One of my favorite things about Ubooly is that when I turn my (very expensive) device over to my kids to play with- it is all zipped up in a very plush and cushy protective covering. So that makes me feel a bit better when my kids leave the room giggling with Ubooly in hand.When you first start playing with Ubooly- your little guy starts asking questions, ""Would you like to hear a joke?"" or ""Would you like to listen to music?"" and your kids are answering and treating Ubooly as if he is a real live creature! But my favorite thing I've seen so far is when Ubooly had a case of the hiccups! My kids were hysterical- AND concerned! They kept telling Ubooly to hold his breath!I am really impressed with the technology.... that the app is programmed for Ubooly to listen to a series of responses and react accordingly. It makes him seem so real- even I wanted to hang around and see what he would say next! I was especially pleased when Ubooly started telling my kids some facts about the moon- how far away it is, etc.... (Yes, Ubooly is educational!) And the other cool thing is that the app updates monthly with new activities (using your devices Wifi connection)- so he evolves and grows along with your kids!",5
"Sunshine Kids Radian Travel Bag, Black","we had purchased the old style sunshine kids travel bag for our radian 65 and found it way over sized & cumbersome. THIS bag, on the other hand, fits our carseat like a skin, has a cinch strap, and backpack straps that are very comfortable. also has a handy strap on top. the hardware is metal & appears to be fairly strong. i wish we had bought this one first and not wasted our money on the old version. this version is much improved and worked very well for us when we checked the carseat.",5

"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster Car Seat, Midnight Desert Micofiber","Great seat.  The generous head supports are just what we needed.  in this seat he remains upright while sleeping, looking very secure and peaceful.  He keeled over while sleeping in other seats we have tried (the cheap evenflo amp was one we had prior).I am happy with the fit in our compact car - i have a bmw 328 sportwagon it is very compact in the back seat area and the way the seats are molded I wasnt sure what booster would fit best (meaning would i forever be scraping my hands to wrestle to get out stuck underneath and would the carseat be tippy because of the molding etc)",5
Levana Safe N'See Digital Video Baby Monitor with Talk-to-Baby Intercom and Lullaby Control (LV-TW501),"I looked around at a lot of monitors and liked this one the most. It has good signal range, the color on the screen is great, and the best part is that I can talk to my son. Most of the other monitors are similiar to this one except for the ""talking back"" feature.The one drawback is the camera seems cheaply made and sometimes doesn't send a signal to the base monitor.",3
Levana Safe N'See Digital Video Baby Monitor with Talk-to-Baby Intercom and Lullaby Control (LV-TW501),This is a really cool product with lots of features.  It even measures the ambient temperature.

"Sugarbooger Children's Closet Dividers, Pink Dot","I love these! The orange dots are too adorable. It fits over the closet pole well and slides very easily. I love the fact that they come with multiple sticker labeling options such as 3-6 months or day of the week, etc. With an infant, they are a big help in keeping his clothes organized and separated by size. I will be using these for years to come.",5

Mamas &amp; Papas 2013 Pixi Highchair - Raspberry,"This is my 3rd child, hence my 3rd high chair...I only wish I would've had this chair with my other kiddos. It cleans up So so easy....no crevices to get crumbs out of...no padding to take apart, and so far( 4months of use) no discoloration on padding or tray...the legs stick out a little and when I feed I can't scoot my chair right up to her but I manage just fine. Another thing I noticed is that the bottom is very scuffed already...since the base is white it picks up easily...Love that it is small and folds up very easily! I would by again and again if I have more children",5
"American Baby Company 3-Pack 100% Cotton Terry Washcloth Set, Blue",These are very soft on baby.  They are also extra big for baby.  Normal baby cloths are too small.  These are perfect.,5
,"I gave this a rating of 5 because it's great in that it is sturdy, great size and height, and is easy to maneuver in and out of, that said, it's very cumbersome, awkward and frustrating to put together.  The attaching parts could be made for ease of joining instead of being so manual and complicated.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,This is my 6 month old's new favorite toy.  He likes the crinkly noise and the many colors.,5
Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat in Regal,Me and my son both LOVE this seat. It is so comfortable that every time he gets in it he's asleep within 5 minutes! It's like a miracle seat for us! With his last seat he would whine and fuss the whole time in the car and could never get comfortable; with this seat it's the complete opposite.,4
Carter's Jungle Jill 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"For my granddaughters bed, it looks so cute, it matches all the colors and animals we needed. I wish it was just a little bigger because we are using it on a toddlers bed.. I guess it is better for a crib, even though a toddlers bed is the same size. we needed it more for a bedspread, but it works.",5
"Nuby Bug A Loop Teether Bead, Colors May Vary","My 3 month old will use this teether, while most others are just a bit bigger, and too big for his hands to hold onto easily (and he's a big boy).  This one has different shapes, colors, textures and sizes on it that he enjoys.  It also has little bugs with wings that stick out for him to nibble on.  I like that it is free of harmful chemicals and safe for baby.",5
Sunshine Kids Stuff 'n Scuff Seat Protector - Black,I have two grandchildren (7 & 3) and have had this brand since the oldest was two. Through natural wear I had to replace them about six months ago. Replaced with another brand that just did not do the job. Searched and found the original I had used and working like a charm!,5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"ALL Diaper contraptions smell.  Don't buy into the hype that this one prevents the diapers from smelling less.  When I empty the thing - most of the wrapped packages come undone, which can be irritating.  It took me a month to figure out how to change the darn bag also.  After 5 months I am still not doing it right each time.  (And I do computer coding...How is it this diaper pail has me searching for the badly written directions all the time?!)  My son's messy diapers are VERY messy and since you have to push the diaper or wipes WAY down in there - I'm usually getting muck on my hand.  I can see why some like this Genie and others don't but I'm headed back to the store.  ONE PLUS:  you can find the replacement bags all over the place because it's so popular.",3
Cradle Mattresses - Size 15x33,I bought this item to replace the original mattress that came with my cradle.  I received the cradle as a gift over 25 years ago and I'm now passing it on to my daughter.  This mattress fits exactly like the original.,5

"Halo Sleepsack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Medium Pink Argyle","Thevquality of the sleep sack is great. I love the argyle and the butterfly is very cute.  My little girl sleeps in these every night. The fleece one gets a little warm, so we use the regular clothe one more often.  A great baby shower gift would be a newborn, small & medium. Sleep sacks, year one!I recommend more than one, of course, so one can be used and another in the wash.",5

"Summer Infant 2 Pack Waterproof Mattress Pad Protectors, White, 18&quot; x 27&quot;","I bought these to put under the sheet in my daughter's pack and play, and they work great. One pad doesn't fill up the whole platform, but it's large enough that she'd have to roll over, hug a side wall and overflow her diaper for it to miss. They also fit in the co-sleeper when we were still using that.",5
"Dream On Me Baby Bather Bath Tub Stand, Gray",no reason to seat on the floorall over Europe babies bath tub is on stand. no reason to band if you can stand,5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"If you buy it, make sure you take it out of the box immediately and use it for a few days (pre-baby) to make sure it works.  The company will only take it back for 30 days (and time flies once the baby arrives).I bought this a week before the baby was born, when I opened it 2 weeks later I realized all the problems that it had.  I used it for 5 days when the display started flipping and freezing.The frozen picture is really a problem because you think you are watching baby nap, but you only see the frozen picture.  Its scary to think you are watching baby sleep safely, only to find that baby has wiggled to a new place in the crib.  This has potential to be quite dangerous!I called the customer service/ tech support number and was hung up on repeatedly.  I left 3 messages over 3 weeks time and never got a return call.  I finally emailed and they said it was too late to return it for a full refund.  I got a partial refund (minus the cost for me to ship the unit back) and bought a different monitor.The audio is the only thing that worked consistently, $100 is a lot to spend for an audio only monitor.",1
"Graco SnugRide Click Connect 35 Car Seat, Tangerine","Love this car seat, the colors on line do not do it justice...... Its amazing and perfectly matches the baby stroller....  Sucks I had to order as separate pieces due to the size limit for overseas.  But none the less love it and im sure my wife will be extremely surprised when we due the Baby Shower.....",5
"Trend Lab CribWrap Fleece Rail Cover for Long Rail, White, Narrow",This rail cover was SUPER easy to put on and fits like a glove!  My son started chewing on his crib and I worried about him ingesting paint so I decided to look for a product that would protect both him and the crib.  This is a great product.  It blends in nicely with our white crib and it's nice and soft.,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I don't have a dishwasher, so this saves me the hassle of having to boil water and sterilizing.  It says that everything inside will remain sterilized as long as you keep the lid on.  But then how will it all get dried?  That's the only down side.  You're suppose to take out the water after 2 minutes, but you have to leave the lid off or else the water won't evaporate.  When you boil water to sterilize, the water inside the bottles evaporate much more quickly.  This uses steam, so condensation is still left inside the bottles.  Just so you know.  Don't get me wrong, I like it a lot and it saves me time, I use it to sterilize my bottles and pump parts every night.  Just wished it allowed the water to evaporate more quickly.",4
"NUK Disney Winnie the Pooh 5 Ounces Learner Cup Silicone Spout, 6+ Months (Pack of 4)",these cups are great for toddlers learning to drink.  The double handle makes it easy to handle for them and less spills.  Love the pooh design on the outside.,5
"Ikko Bassinet Pad- Small, White",This pad fit perfect for my massenet and I love how thick it is. Can't wait to be able to use it in the coming months =) only bad thing was it was a few days late in being delivered.,5
"Ameda 2 Pack Breast Pump Valves,",I was hesitant to buy these because I don't have an Ameda or Medela pump. I have the purple double electric lansinoh breast pump. These fit great and worked great when I used them on my lansinoh pump. I'm so glad these are available to buy because sometimes they wrip. Thank you Ameda!,5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"I'm clumsy.  Maybe it's because we have twins and i didn't sleep much for three years.  Anyway, i've dropped this monitor probably a dozen times, and it STILL works flawlessly.  As other reviewers have noted, it is free of static (unlike the earlier monitors we tried), you can put it on voice-activated to filter out background music/noise, and it is extremely sensitive to our children's quietest sounds (turning over in bed, light snoring, yawns).  Even after four years of continuous use, and many drops on the floor, it still works very well, although the rechargeable battery is nearing the end of its lifespan.  To solve the two-monitor dilemna, we eventually bought a second set so we could have one for each child, and we use a different setting for each.  One other plus from its excellent sound quality -- now that our babies are older, we get to enjoy the cheerful sounds of their voices making up morning songs as they wake up.",5
"Lillian Rose Diaper Bag, Building The Foundation Daddy, 17.5&quot; x 6&quot; x 12.5&quot;","I ordered this to give to my son-in-law and couldn't be more pleased!

The picture just doesn't come close to showing how nice it is.",5
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Sleeping bag, Butterflies, Large",I wanted to get a sleep sack for my granddaughter that was light weight so she would just have enough material to snuggle with but not feel hot in. This product was exactly what I needed!,5
Lamaze Celeste Play &amp; Grow,Great gift for new mothers and baby girls.  My daugter loved her smily sunny face and we put it in her crib and stroller.  She has outgrown the toy but it has been passed on to our niece who loves it.  Toy has lasted more than 5 years so far and is easy to clean.,5
Sealy Tender Vibes Soothing Mattress,This mattress fit perfectly into our crib.  Batteries are easy to get to but screwed in so that small hands cannot get to them. Vibration feature is strong enough to be felt through bedding without shaking the baby too much.,5
Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 3 (Mint color mix),"This is one of the greatest inventions ever!! Makes cloth diapering so easy. Has a little clip at each end similar to an ace bandage (But not pointy, although they still recommend putting a diaper cover over when using these) You just clip it to one end, the other and then down the middle and the diaper stays in place. They are great and so easy. I wouldn't do without them!!",5
Safety 1st Hospital's Choice 8 Second Digital Thermometer,"this thermometer beeps when it is done taking the temperature and works fine under the arm or orally. but, for some reason, when done rectally, it has never beeped to let me know the temp taking is complete - it just shuts itself off after 10-15 seconds. very frustrating as i'm trying to get newborn's temp to know if i need to take her in or not and i'm never assured that i'm getting an accurate reading. for oral or underarm it is fine.",2
Elegant Baby Cotton Cable Knit Teddy Bear - Pink,I would have to agree with another customer that this teddy is not as cute when you see it in person and the size seems smaller.  I do however like the fact that the eyes and nose are sewn in which prevents any choking hazards.  I bought the all white teddy and it goes well with my modern nursery!,3
Mam Bottles BPA Free w/Silk Nipple - 11 oz (Single Pack) (Blue),We absolute love this bottles from the beginning for our son. I liked the way they designed it. I never had leaking issues and cleaning was so easy. He loved it so much. I wished they made sippy cup too.,5
Sassy Soft Grip Comb &amp; Brush,"I have used both the brush and the comb on our newborn.  The bristles on the brush are so soft, he likes the massage, and it helps rid his head of the cradle cap.  The comb is also soft, I certainly wouldnt violently run it through my newborns scalp, but with a gentle stroke it works just fine!",5
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,This product worked well for the first few months. After a while the screen on the monitor began to flicker on and off. It became more and more frequent untill it quit working altogether. We took it back to the store where we got it and the representative said he has seen many come back due to problems.,2
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle / Foot Finder Set of 4 (2 Wrist 2 Footies),He was a tiny baby and didn't really get much use out of this.  I know of other babies that have this set and loved them. I think it depends on how active the baby is.,3
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","Im not sure how the previous commenter's son ended up upside down. My mother bought this rocker for my son when he was born, and in the past five months he has just loved it. I put it in the kitchen so he can watch me cooking from a safe distance, and have something to entertain him.THeres really no way for the rocker to flip, as it has plastic knobs on the bottom front and back that prevent it from rocking all the way back or forward. Also, theres a metal frame in the front that can flip out and it forces the chair to stay still, if you dont want the rocking. my son, who is 20 lbs can easily rock it on his own by just kicking his feet, which he loves. Sometimes I use the stationary position when Im trying to feed him.It wasnt until just a few weeks ago that he actually began to reach out and pull the middle string to cause the ""if youre happy and you know it"" song to play. I personally thik that the song plays very loud and shrill, but i guess babies like high pitched music. Also, it takes a pretty hard pull to activate the song, which is why he was not able to do it before 4 1/2 months. It would have been nice if the two outside animals would make a noise too when pulled.I especially like that the hanging toys arc can easily be removed and the chair can transition long into toddlerhood as a big boy rocker even after he starts to walk and can get in and out himself.THe bright colors are very vibrant and mine has not faded at all. THe material is soft and sturdy. Also, the metal frame seems to be very strong and durable.All in all, i think its a great chair for newborns to toddlers and look forward to getting much more use out of it.",5
"Rhoost Edge Table Corner Protector, 4 Pack, Black","These corner covers are great, they fit nice and there's not glue or tape to mess up my stained hope chest.",5

Safety 1st Bath Toy Bag,This little toy bag is amazing!  It holds a TON and I mean a TON of toys and never falls off the wall.,5
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink",My kids love washing their hands. Playing with soap and water is an ongoing activity in my house. The problem is that my 2 year old has a hard time reaching the water even on her tip toes and on a step stool. This is the best product ever. I think it is a great idea and solves the problem most parents experience with handwashing. I bought one to try it out but will definitely buy one for all of my bathroom sinks.,5
"Evenflo Cozy Sleeves - 4 oz - 1 pk, Girl Color",I was very pleased to see the item arrive in just a few days.  I was worried if the item would fit the bottles and if my daughter would be able to put it on the bottles easily.  It fit the bottle perfectly and she did get it on the bottle without a struggle.  She was also amazed how she had a better grip on the glass bottle.,5
Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Organic Cotton Wipes,"These wipes were so thin and flimsy I felt like I was wiping my baby's bottom with tissues. It took me four or five wipes to clean up a mess that other wipes could tackle in one or two. They were soft, sure, but they had no grippy texture and were really just ineffective at cleaning up poo. Donated to Goodwill after trying just a few times. Learn from my mistake! (The wipes I finally ended up liking were the GroVia ones. They were a bit rougher to start with but have really softened up over time.)",1
"Baby Trend Nursery Center Playard, Safari Kingdom",We use this daily while our newborn sleeps in our room at night. I find it very durable though the mobile isn't very secure and will fall off most times if it's bumped by a hand or arm when picking your infant up. I also find the diaper holder easier for use inside the pack n play outside diapers seem to fall out on the floor but for a basic pack n pay I love it and the bassinet is great,4
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"This mobile keeps my 1 month old interested, but the quality of the product is undesirable. The top card does not form a nice 90 degree with the bottom once it is inserted.  We only wish the cards can be a little easier to change.",3
"Playtex DisneyInsulator Spout Cup, Finding Nemo, 9 Ounce, 2-Count","Not only is the price good, but these sippy cups are durable. The spout is hard plastic so you don't have to worry about your toddler biting through them. They use the same stoppers as the soft plastic playtex handled sippy cups so once your toddler bites through those ones, you can still use the stoppers for this cup. Drinks do stay colder for longer and my daughter loves the &#34;fish&#34; cup!",5
Jeep Car Seat Travel Bag,"I put the infant car seat in the bag to test it out and the zipper broke that minute. I would caution anyone wanting to buy this. There are drawstring options available, try that.",1
"UPPAbaby 2013 G-lite Stroller, Denny Red","Here are a few interesting tidbits I didn't come across in the product reviews before my purchase:- The wheels are made of soft rubber (not hard plastic) which helps smooth the ride in addition to the springy suspension.- There is a huge white tag on the back, similar to the ones you find on a mattress that says if you cut it off you will go to prison (ok, anyone except the consumer).  This gigantuan tag just describes the polyester material and it was fun to cut it off with scissors.- Keep the baby's hands away while folding.  The first time I tried to fold it, I pinched my pinkie finger in the Velociraptor of the frame - OUCH!!- Made in China (I don't like this, hopefully it is more durable than most Chinese manufactured products).I'm glad I got this one instead of the G-Luxe version.  The wheels are large enough for urban use, and the recline is not worth the extra weight for me.  For real off-roading I have a Baby Jogger stroller, and it is nice to have two wildly different size strollers at the opposite ends of the spectrum.",4
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Has a basic nightlight, projection light with three pattern disks, and multiple sounds.  Nature, lullabies, classical music and heartbeat are various noises to get your baby or child to sleep.  Has a timer to cut off, and is voice activated by unhappy baby if he or she were to wake up.  Love that it cuts right back on.  Great product.",5
Disney Winnie the Pooh Lovie Blanket,My one year old grand daughter loves to cuddle down with this Pooh Bear. It's small and just right in the car seat or the crib.,4
"Kissaluvs Marvels One Size Fitted Diaper, Mocca Swirl","I won two of these in a FB drawing and love them.  I already had the contours, one size, and wet bags from Kissaluvs.  I think they are a great company with excellent customer service.  I had an issue with one of my marvel one size dipes and they worked quickly to correct it.  These fitteds are my favorite, I only wish they had this print in an all in one diaper!! Its too cute to keep covered!  Super absorbant.  I love that the company makes its products in the US and that its family owned.  Great company with exceptional products.  I just bought the wipes solution and can't wait to use it.",5

Avon Kids Car Desk Light &amp; Write Portable Work Play Space Children Arts &amp; Crafts Free Sitckers,"Okay, big road trip coming up this summer with two four year olds, been looking for something like the Alex car Valet and found this new on eBay for only $7.99 plus 4.99 shipping, so way better than the $32 being quoted here, and please note that this originally sold for $14.99 directly from Avon exclusively.  Anyway, I was intrigued by this car desk because it came with a light for reading when it is dark (tired of letting the kids have the dome light on) and it has a dry erase board which seemed like it would provide a stiff enough surface for writing/drawing on, I had read some reviews of the Alex Car Valet that complained about the writing surface not being strong enough to support writing/drawing.  I will admit that the fact that the Alex Car Valet was crash tested is appealing, but I will say, that while this is a dry erase board, it is still a little flexible, how flexible in a crash I don't know, Avon never tested these.  This car desk has all the little pouches and pockets and space needed, comes with a dry erase eraser, and I will be swapping out the dry erase marker it came with for a fully washable one I found at Walmart (they also have washable dry erase crayons).  I also feel that when open it is sturdily held at a 90 degree angle, something else that I had read as a complaint about the Alex Car Valet.  Now, I took one of my daughters out to the truck right away to try it on for size as there were a lot of complaints about the Alex Car Valet not reaching kids' laps.  With as close as things are in our truck (Tacoma) I did not think this was going to be a problem and it wasn't.  However, it had to be strung up quite high and the strap did not get short enough to keep it high enough, that is something I think I can take care of by stitching the strap myself to the length we need.  One complaint I do have is that it only comes with one strap, there is nothing to keep the unit strapped down at the bottom, it just hangs from the top.  At least this is around the bars of the head rest and the straps don't touch the person in the seat, I had read that the straps on the Alex Car Valet can be uncomfortable for the person in the seat they are strapped to.  A second complaint is the lack of instructions, it had a small advisory about the dry erase marker and a thing about the light and its batteries and all, but nothing about how to hang on the seatback, I mean what if I am doing it wrong and that's why the strap is too long?  The straps sure look different in the picture than when I try to hang it.  Now, would I buy this again?  Yes, as long as I was buying it for the same as or cheaper than the Alex Car Valet (which I found as cheap as $13 before shipping).  That said, since I have twins and need another one of these, if I do not find another Avon Light and Write Car Organizer in time for our big road trip at a decent price, then I will buy an Alex Car Valet and hope the twins don't fight over who gets the more colorful car desk :)Addendum, the larger of our twins is a pound away from being able to use a butt booster, we purchased one for her though are not using it yet, and I tried this car desk with her in the booster and it does not reach her because the booster has her sitting back farther than the 5 pt. harness car seat.  Also, Avon has released new travel desks, they are licensed characters form Nickelodeon and Disney, and the are the same except that they only have one large mesh pocket and do not come with the light, the sell for $13 right now directly from Avon.",4

"Kalencom On the Go Potty, Blue","We don't go anywhere without it.It was worth every penny. Now, if only my toddler used it ALL the time...",5
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,This is a great product if you make large amounts of formula It saved my arm from having to shake lots of bottles each day and makes a whole day's worth of bottles in one go. I have loved this for both of my daughters.,5
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","I purchased the Fuzzibunz one size elite along with several other pocket diapers to try on my daughter.  Compared to other pocket diapers, the Fuzzinbunz diaper is much trimmer, which I like a lot.  I also like that I have not had any leaks with this diaper. However, the pocket is very narrow and the PUL is quite sticky, making it more difficult to stuff than any of my other diapers.  I also do not like love the way the diaper adjusts (elastic); it has been difficult to get a good fit.  Overall, this is a good diaper, but at this price point, I prefer other diapers.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","We have both the Mocha Turtle, and Ladybug Cloud B night lights, one for each of my daughters - one is 9 years and one is  9 months and they both use them every night!The thing I love most about them (other than how cute they are!) is how long the lights stay on. Both girls are asleep by the time they switch off. They are not too bright but the room is filled with a nice glow from all the stars all over the ceiling/wall.The Turtle glows blue, yellow and green and has an option to cycle through the colours automatically. The Ladybug does NOT have this option and I didn't realise it at the time, and was a little disappointed to find out, though it's more my fault for not reading carefully. Ladybug can glow red, blue or green.The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because the batteries (3 x AAA) don't last as long as I'd like before the lights start getting dim. The turtle will stay yellow and just flash instead of cycling when the batteries start getting low. The ladybug seems to run the batteries down slightly faster than the turtle, not sure why.Overall though, I do love them and would recommend these beautiful nightlights. I actually want to get another one for myself :)",4
"Munchkin Shampoo Rinser, Colors May Vary",The flexible material allows the mouth of the mug to mold around my son's head allowing the water to flow away from his face! It is light weight and durable. We love it!,5
"Frenchie Mini Couture Tuxedo Bib with 3D Applique, Black","Once you get this bib all you need is a monocle and a nice pipe and you could be the star of the baby celebration ball for something baby related.  I bought it as a gift, I hope the refined taste is appreciated.",5
Munchkin See Baby Backseat Mirror,"it was really hard to find a mirror that worked well for the captain's chairs in my minivan, but this was the solution!  It's hard to tell in the pictures, but this mirror is basically made up of two parts- the base, which has two easily adjustable straps and clips to wrap around the headrest, one over the top/bottom and the other on the sides.  Then this base has the mirror on a stiff swivel that can be adjusted in a LARGE range of angles.  Very much worth the money, especially if you are using captains chairs in a minivan!  Oh, and this mirror doesn't distort the way others do, it's a very clear view of your baby!",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Miracle, Black/Silver, Cotton Mix","Easy to use for both parents, easy to clean, easy to adjustable.We can dress baby with hot clothes without he is oppressed.",5
Bumgenius Freetime Cloth Diapers 6 Pack Mixed Colors Snaps,"These are some of the best cloth diapers I have tried. They are absorbable and light, and get more absorbable as you wash them. I have a long, thinner baby and they fit him very well. Really nice quality product. The absorbable material on the inside is made thicker with these flaps - look at some pics fo see what I mean - but these are crucial for drying in the sun or dryer in the same amount of time as other clothes. Othe brands of diapers need additional dry time, which is a huge pain. The only thing I would change is to make it tagless! I hate tags and cut them off. But super diaper, worth every penny.",5
Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,"We needed to transport 2 suitcases, a diaper bag, camera case, a stroller, 2 car seats, a 3 year old, and a 9 month old to/from airplane/car and with only 2 adults, I wasn't sure how we'd manage it.  I saw this and thought it would be perfect to strap one of the car seats onto the larger suitcase and have the 3 year old ride in it.  I read the reviews and saw someone said they just used a strap and got some other piece from the hardware store and did it themselves.  Being frugal, I figured I could do the same thing but couldn't quite envision what the other person was doing.  We ended up using a cargo strap and it worked out great!  My son loved riding in his seat through the airport and we managed to get everything to/from airplane/cars without an issue.I gave it 2 stars just for the idea.",2
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Snuggle Cub Soother Mobile,I bought this as a gift for my best friends new grandson. We both  really liked it. The quality was excellent.,5
Britax Back Seat Mirror,"I really like this mirror as it is in a swivel and allows for more positioning than a traditional mirror, but it does move easily if bumped.",4
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","This is the perfect size for my (98% tall) 2 1/2 year old. We have to watch the weight, but it stays on her shoulders well, and as she grows she'll be able to carry more. She can open the zippers easily and get things in and out by herself. It fits a coloring book and a surprising amount of stuff! I can see her using this for a number of years. Would definitely recommend!",5
"Tadpoles Damask Set of 2 Tab Top Curtain Panels, Black/White","I like these curtains, I do not have them in a nursery, they are in my kitchen... they match my kitchen towels and dish drying mats.",5
"Athena Nadia 3 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","We've had this for almost 3 years and have just re-assembled it for our second child. It has held up so well with our very active daughter. I've looked at and felt many different cribs and not found any in this price range that feel nearly as sturdy. Most seem to have thinner slats that feel plasticy and shake and wobble a lot. This is all wood and does not have that cheap, wobbly feel.",5
BuggyBagg Shopping Cart Cover - Single Pattern: Jungle,"I did a lot of research before I bought this product, reading reviews and such.  This cart cover is fantastic!  It has everything and well worth the price.  I love that I can just throw my wallet and keys in the zipper pocket and go.  I don't have to lug a purse or diaper bag.The BEST thing about this product is that it can be placed in the cart and removed all with one hand.  When you have a child in one arm that is essential.  The other cart covers with elastic all the way around require two hands.There are loops for connecting toys, places to hold snacks and a drink.  The thing I use the least is the pillow.  I used it all the time when she was an infant and I would lay her down in the cart.  Also used it to prop her up when she was first learning to sit up.  Otherwise, I don't use it anymore.My daughter is now 16 months and I still use it several times a week.  I also use it in restaurant highchairs, but it makes a tight fit.I would definitely recommend this product.  This is one of those MUST HAVE items that mom's pass on to each other.",5
"Manhattan Toy Snuggle Pod, Peanut",I found this while searching for Christmas presents for my 3 month old daughter. We call her Peanut so it seemed very fitting :-) I received it in record time and am so happy with it! No wonder it is moving up the Bestseller list! The doll inside the peanut is blue and is small enough for her to hold on to. She is starting to really grab and hold things and I'm sure she is going to love her first doll from Santa!,5
"Carters Easy Fit Velour Plush Crib Fitted Sheet, Chocolate",I love this sheet. It was exactly as it was described. I live in Maine so it will be great for those cold nights.,5
Sticky Bellies -Sticky Bellies Monthly Milestone Stickers - Oh Sew Ready : Maternity : 12-40 Weeks,"Every parent should order this for their baby. This is also a great gift, it's simple and easy to use a lot of ppl don't think about it so is def something def",5
"Bummis Swimmi Cloth Diapers, Turtles, Small (9-15 lbs)","I really like that this swim diaper has velcro tabs on both sides. It is so easy to put on and take off and will keep any mess inside the diaper. Cute designs, too!",5
"Sesame Street Bath Gift Set (Hooded Towel, 2 Washclothes &amp; Terry Sponge)","Got this for a bath time theme gift for my nephew who loves Sesame Street. It's super cute and colorful, which he loves. It's a little bit on the thin side for a towel but it certainly gets the job done!",4
Dream On Me Potty Trainer Plus,Grandson has no problem sitting there. Entertaining while training. No fussing no crying no whining. Will go sit on his own.,5
"American Baby Company Jersey Knit Crib Sheet, Lavender",Haven't had this item long but we like it! The jersey knit is much cozier for baby than the typical cheap cotton sheet. I like it enough that when I somehow misplaced the first one I bought (gotta love baby brain) I ordered another!,5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I never use my dishwasher (I hand wash everything), so this sterilizer was really convenient and practical for my pre-mature baby.  The only problem I had was that 1 of the bottles got partially melted, and that was on about the 10th use of the sterilizer.  I haven't had any other difficulties since then, and that's even with laying my Dr. Brown's long & skinny bottles on their sides (I don't sterilize the inner tubing though, just in case).",4
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","First two weeks I held the bottles and it was not fun. My arms got tried along with a waste of time. After getting this product I could check emails, attend to more baby demands with free hands,  play a game on my cell phone (a few minutes of mommy time to help my sanity) and just relax better.",5
Baby Jogger 2013 City Select Stroller with Second Seat - Onyx,"I absolutely love this stroller! I originally purchased the phil and ted double stroller. It was great as a single, but as soon as I had my 2nd baby I hated it due to lack of storage space, popped 2 tires in 2 months and my daughter hated sitting in the back seat. So then I found this stroller and wished I had got it in the first place.My favorite things about it is the variety of seat configurations, great storage space, narrow profile so it is perfect for taking to the mall. The ONLY thing I don't like about it is that it is pretty heavy, but I think all high quality double strollers are heavy.",5
"Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep","This item was recommended by many so I purchased it for our little one.  The only complaint I would have is that it looks very dirty in real life, it's not a white or even an off white.  It looks a lot darker than it does in pictures.",5
"Dabbawalla Lunch Bag, Cute as a Bug",I needed something to throw into the washer and this can handle it. Great colors and my son lives it.,5
Kolcraft Tender Vibes Travel Bassinet with Music,This is absolutely worth the price. The wheels went on with no troubles at all. It is very sturdy and the padding is thin but definitely thick enough for an infant. I wouldn't bother replacing the padding because it is fine. It looks gorgeous and is a great size and height. I wouldn't waste any money on something that costs more. Great product for a fantastic price!,5
Replacement Battery For Motorola Digital Video Baby Monitor TFL AAA Model MBP33 MBP36 MBP36PU Part TFL3X44AAA900 CB94-01A 3.6V NiMH,"product is definitely not specifically designed for the Motorola MBP-36 as claimed.  It's a generic universal charger with an adapter plug.  The pins on the adapter I received were bent and barely fit the cord.  It charges the unit, but only when you jiggle the cord and get the connection to sit at just the right angle.For the price, it's OK...but you get what you pay for.",3
"Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Black","I received this bag as a baby shower gift and really liked it.  The style was great, loved the design... but it's very poorly made.  After carrying it the FIRST time the inside liner started ripping.  I ended up returning it and ordering a Timi & Leslie one which I love!",2
My First Christmas Photo Album,This is the perfect photo album for my newborn son. The photos slide in easily and stay put without being obnoxiously stubborn to get out if you want to rearrange the photos. [...]you won't be disappointed when this is delivered...a great product and very cute.,5
"Comfort &amp; Harmony Mombo Deluxe Covered Nursing Pillow, Enchanting Elephants","Excellent for grandparents/babysitters!This is a wonderful, if not necessary purchase for anyone who cares for an infant, whether nursing or not. I got this pillow for my baby grandson to use when he visits. It's adorable, well-made, soft but supportive, and versatile.I use it for comfort and support while bottle feeding him, and it makes his tummy time more comfortable, as he has an easier time looking around.  It's also been great for propping the little guy up while I'm tasking;  he's content and relaxed in it. We've used the vibrational feature and it seems to soothe him, but he's otherwise happy without it so far.I feel this is a must-have for anyone with a little one in their home! Highly recommended!",5
Baby Girl Necessities Photo Mat 11 x 14,"I just received the baby girl necessities photo mat in 3D and just love it.  In addition, I ordered 2 school years scrap a mat school days mats and I loved them too.  The 3D mat is really done up so beautifully with the little 3D dress and other items and I am giving this to my daughter in law as part of a baby shower gift.  I know she will love it, too.I am so completely satisfied with Bellas Dream Photo Mats.  It's fun just looking at all of the mat designs and colors they have. I have dealt with them on a replacement issue and they have exceeded my expectations in how it was handled.  I highly recommend them if you need to either give a unique gift to someone or just want to have a quality product for your own child or children.  Definitely will purchase from Bellas in the future.",5
"Wupzey Shopping Cart Cover, Orange Stripe","Very well made.  We used it everywhere we went.  Easy to install, washes easy, and covered all areas our daughter would try to touch on the cart.  We received many compliments for it and we were asked many times where do you buy one of these at.  A must have unless you like cleaning a shopping cart before you place your child in it.",5
"Bright Starts Bounce Bounce Baby Activity Zone, Neutral","I have been very happy with this toy considering it is about half the price of other activity centers. I chose this one because I live in a small apt and wanted something that could be moved easily through doorways and fit into my tiny bathroom.  It doesn't have as many toys on it as some of the other centers, but you get what you pay for, I figure.  The toys it does have are fun and sturdy.We got it when my daughter was 9 months old, and then she would play in it happily for 20 minutes.  Now, at a year old, she is ready to get out after 10, but I guess that is to be expected.  I only put her in it about twice a week at the most now.  But she pulls up on it and likes to crawl through it, so she is still having fun with it in her own way.I will confirm what other reviewers have said -- this absolutely does NOT bounce! It does not have springs in the seat like an Exersaucer.  I guess maybe if my daughter jumped really, really hard, she might be able to make the platform bounce a tiny bit, but I haven't wanted to encourage that.If you have more space and more money, I would suggest an Exersaucer instead. You would probably get more mileage out of it. (Our church has one, and my daughter does seem to enjoy it more.)  But if you are on a tight budget and/or living in a tight space, this is a good deal.",4
Kel - Gar Tubbly - Bubbly Hippo,This keep my baby from hitting his head on the water spout in the tub. My only complaint is that it comes off way too easily... he can pull it off by himself so I try to keep him away from it as much as possible.,4
"Tinkerbell Costume for Toddler Tinkerbelle Birthday Party and Dress Up, Green, Small 1T-2T","Great gift for my 2 year old daughter this year.  Wings are very sturdy and nice quality, the skirt was made well too.",5
PlayTray for the Stokke Tripp Trapp  - Transparent,"I was very impressed when I received the play tray in the mail as it was much heavier, very sturdy and thicker then I antcipated.I have the original Tripp Trapp high chair with the European style infant seat attached and it fit perfectly over the infant insert.  This play tray also has a rectangular metal bar attched underneath and comes with a black strap so you can anchor the play tray to the high chair without the infant seat attched and the strap will go between the childs leggs to keep them from sliding out.I have been using my play tray for a month now with my 9 month old in the infant insert and love it.  I can let him make a mess while eating the simply slide the play tray off and throw the food in the bin and wash the tray properly and slide it back on.For more information this is the website of the company that makes the play tray:[....]",5
"Medela Quick Clean Breastmilk Removal Soap, 6 Ounce","This is the one registry item that I wouldn't buy again nor recommend to others.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing innately wrong with this soap, I just feel that it was a rather useless item and that your money is better spent on the 5,000 other baby things that you need to buy.",2
"Colgate Classica III Foam Crib Mattress, White","This mattress is lightweight, durable, and waterproof.  My daughter sleeps 12 plus hours a night on this mattress, and after nearly 2 years of use it still looks brand new!  I will be buying another one for my next child.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I read about these bottles in a magazine and bought them to use for my newborn daughter. For my first child, I used the Dr. Brown's bottles and loved them; though I did not like washing the extra pieces. Since the concept here was similar and there weren't so many pieces to the bottle, I thought I'd try them.  Big mistake! I tried them for 4 days.  It took over an hour just to give her a bottle each time with this system.  On the fourth day, 4 of the six nipples collapsed!  It was ridiculous.  A six pound newborn should not be able to do that to any nipple - never mind after only 4 days.  Don't waste your money.  I went back to the old reliable Dr Brown's bottles.  They are the best and I decided that she was more than worth the few extra minutes it required to clean them.",1
Fisher-Price Smart Stages 3-in-1 Rocker Swing,"When our swing arrived I was actually kind of disappointed since it didn't seem to swing at all even on the highest  setting. I called Fisher Price to complaint about it and they told me to change the batteries since that was the most common reason for the swings not working properly. I did, and nothing seemed to change. So I called them again wanting to return the product, they told me that they would send me a new motor part in order to fix the problem. I was very skeptical, but when the part arrived (next day, bravo Fisher Price!) and I replaced it, it started to work wonderfully, maybe even a little too fast for my newborn, but he seemed to like it.Every time we need a moment for ourselves we know the swing will work his magic. Hey, sometimes he enjoys it even without the swinging motion, so it's a convenience that I can transport the little chair to spots the whole swing couldn't fit.At the beginning I thought the two little toys that came with it were too small, but our son seems to love them and he's starting to coo and giggle at them (or yelling at them as well, don't ask..)I also love the idea of being able to keep the rocking chair once our son gets too big for the swing.All in all, great and versatile product (specially for the price), and a great experience with Fisher Price's customer service.",5
Skip Hop Swipe Baby Wipes Case,"As described easy to use and holds a good amount of wipes, slight bigger than usual wipes cases but very well made. Recommend this product.",4
The First Years Newborn to Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat,"Three children under five have made full use of The First Years Newborn to Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat feeding chair.  It's really, really practical.  It tilts back for babies (NOT newborns - about 12 weeks and up, give or take variations in head control) and works great as a comfortable booster seat at the table for toddlers and preschoolers.The three-year-old would never finish a meal if he wasn't seated in the feeding chair but because of the sides he can settle down and eat.  In a regular chair or ordinary booster seat he can't resist getting down :).The cover washes up well - I put it in the dryer about five minutes and then let it air dry.  The straps can be removed and washed with liquid dish detergent.  The tray goes through the dishwasher if you like.This feeding seat worked so well I bought a second one to accommodate the latest addition while her big brother continues to use the original.",5
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","I registered for these bottles while I was pregnant based on reviews I had read and hear-say from people I'd meet in the store while ""researching"" them. Of course when you are a first time mom you aren't familiar with any of the baby stuff so you have to take advice on these sorts of things from other moms. I think the concept of these bottles is wonderful but they are too aggravating. I never used one of these bottles that didn't leak. No matter what I did to try to get them not to leak, it didn't work. So they made for a very messy feeding time and a waste of milk; and as a first time mom with a newborn, this is the last thing I wanted to deal with! I always had to make sure that my daughter had a bib on or I had a burp cloth tucked under her chin. I have recently switched to the Playtex VentAire and feeding time is much more enjoyable and not messy at all!",2
Wimmer-Ferguson Infant Stim-Mobile,"This mobile works wonderfully. Our child is fascinated with it and it keeps him engaged for a reasonable amount of time. However, the plastic feels cheap and flimsy. It's quite frustrating to swap the cards on the mobile as well as flipping them.",4
Portacrib 2 Pack Value Jersey White Fitted Sheet by American Baby Company,I bought a small portable crib for my new grandbabies and the sheets fit it beautifully. They are made so that you can use a thicker mattress with them which is awesome because I did buy a thicker mattress as the one most port-a-cribs come with our horrible and thin. The sheets washed great and still look good and love the softness as I don't want anything rough against my grandbabies skin!,5
Fisher-Price Sing with Me Step Stool,My grandson is new at the potty game. He uses the stool for using the pottty and @ the sink to brush his teeth. He loves the music.,5

"Safety 1st Nature Next Booster Seat, Green","Other reviews were right on.  Product was sturdy and price was good, but the straps were right in the middle of the seat and the lower strap was too short to get around my 20-month old in cloth diapers.  I thought maybe I could just use the side straps to buckle him in but those need to buckle into the  middle one.",3
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","We just love the Skip Hop zoo lunch bags. The elephant is very cute and just the right size for our 2 yr old and our 4 1/2 yr old. A sandwich, drink and fruit/yogurt fit well inside; there is a mesh pouch on the inside flap that is great for holding utensils and napkins.  The lunch bag is well insulated. We place an ice pack or cold drink in the bag and it keeps food fresh for several hours.",5
Kidsline Barnyard Wallpaper Border,"I saw this at my local Babies R Us store and had to get it. The border goes really well with the yellow I painted the nursery, and was easy to put on myself (even though I am 7 months pregnant). The only thing I didn't like was that the instructions said soak in warm water for 10 seconds to activate the adhesive which did not work on the first piece I did. It kept falling off. Finally, I switched to hot water soaking for 15 seconds and it went smoother.",4
"Boppy SlideLine Toy Slipcover, Animal Playground",Great color and softness. Love it,5
Travel Potty Chair,"My newly trained 2 year old tends to say she has to potty after we are ten minutes down the road. So, having this in the car has been a lifesaver! My daughter can go in the car, on the side of the road in a discreet side of the car, or just when she needs to go and we are at the park.  BEST BUY EVER! (in my opinion!)  I like that you can use gallon size bags and I especially like the storage on either side for wipes and extra baggies. I tell every mom I know who has a potty trained toddler! It is the best potty seat I could have ever bought!",5
"green sprouts Warming Plate, Sage",it is very good .I want buy it long long ago.It could keep my child's food warming.it is beautiful.I like it,5
InfinityMOM Nursing Scarf (Coral Chevron),"Cute scarf and an ok alternative to those bulky covers, but I quickly realized I'm one of those moms who feels no shame about openly feeding in public when it's necessary and my mini me hates being covered up. She always ripped off covers anyway, so I gave up and just use this as a scarf now.The couple times I did use it, I found it a little difficult. It falls in baby's face and then I understood why the ugly bulky covers are bulky.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Healthy Care High Chair,I love that my daughter can sit and play while I cook dinner and she can watch me the whole time. It is easy to move around and it is so easy to clean.,5
Sassy Extra Gentle Soft Tip Spoons 4 Pack,These are not BPA free which I didnt even realize until after I purchased... I would not recommend these!,1
Vulli Sophie Giraffe So Pure Sophie the Giraffe Teething Ring Key Chain,This product is ok I thought my daughter would chew on it as she chews on my keys all the time.  Not interested.  Also it fails that safety test of if it can fit through a toilet paper roll they can swallow - she can swallow it.  Also it does not come off key ring so its another key ring on my keys!,2
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"We bought the  Diaper Dekor Plus based on what I read in &quot;Baby Bargains&quot; and the recommendations on this web site.  We love the functionality, it is very easy to use and empty, but it makes the whole room stink!  You can even smell it from the hallway.  My son is only 6 weeks old, I can't imagine what it would smell like with older kids diapers.  We have now purchased the new Safety 1st Neat pail...hope it is better.",2
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","Good fit on changing table. The sides prevent baby from rolling over on the changing table, however never walk away while baby is on the table. It is easy to clean and rinse off since it is made of plastic.",5
Bedtime Originals Champ Snoopy 3 Piece Crib Bedding Set,Purchased for my son who is due in March. I haven't set it up yet until a week before baby is born but It seems to be of good quality for the price! I loved the snoopy designs...,5
"Keekaroo High Chair and Infant Insert Tray, Chocolate","We've had this chair for about 3 months & are very pleased with our choice.  I did tons of research before settling on the Keekaroo & have no regrets about my choice.  First and foremost, the fact that it was a wood chair & not a plastic monstrosity in my kitchen is huge.  It blends in well with the decor (although I'm a little disappointed that I didn't wait for the darker finish) & doesn't stick out like a huge sore thumb.  It is fairly easy to clean & doesn't have too many nooks & crannies for messes to hide.  I'm pleased with my decision to purchase the infant insert because even my 9-month old gets pretty squirmy & it keeps her firmly in her place at mealtime.As others have mentioned, I wish there was a plastic cover to protect the tray, but I've heard that is coming & I'll definitely buy one when I see it.  Although I have to say, our tray surface looks perfectly fine after 3+ months of use.  Although our little one is still fed by us & isn't banging silverware or toys on the surface.Compared to many of the others on the market, the price is great for the style of chair.  I read one negative comment about not being able to release the tray with one hand.  We found that we keep the tray inserted upside down so it doesn't lock in when we're not using it.  That way when we're holding baby & wanting to put her in the chair, we can easily pull the tray out & put her in with one hand.  Then we simply flip the tray right side up and lock it in place.",5

"Britax Pavilion 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Biscotti","We LOVE this seat! As parents to 8 children ranging in age from 18 down to 22 months we have some pretty good car-seat experience. We have purchased and used other brands of car-seats thru the years and just now decided to try a Britax after reading countless wonderful reviews on their quality and top of the line safety features. Well, let's just say it is quite obvious to us now that you do truly get what you pay for in terms of quality. This seat is OUTSTANDING in quality materials and workmanship. There is just tons of padding in the seat to make it extra comfortable for your child and all the features are built in a way to ensure the utmost comfort for the child sitting in the seat. We love how easy it was to install this seat- less than 2 minutes and we were ready to go! Latch is a breeze- adjusting the harness height is simple. The new HUGS harness system takes a few extra minutes to get use to and to be able to adjust easily. We had no trouble figuring it out. You simply pull on the actual chest clip piece while using the other hand (finger) to push on the little harness button release lever in the front of the seat under the padding (there is a little opening in the fabric where you stick your finger in to access the release lever). We have no issues at this point with feeling the straps are too short or anything...they are plenty long enough when you loosen them the correct way. If you just try to pull on the straps to loosen them you will only be able to pull them out a little bit due to the new HUGS tethering system. Our son is 22 months old and weighs 26 lbs and is 34"" tall. He has a long torso and shorter legs. He has plenty of room to grow with this seat and stay rear-facing for at least another year or more depending on how fast he grows. We plan to keep him rear-facing till at least age 3- 3.5, as close to age 4 as possible. This is the safest thing for all toddlers and babies! Protects their delicate necks in the event of a collision. He has plenty of leg room and loves to sit with his legs up on the seat back or crossed in  the seat. He is perfectly comfortable in this very plush seat. We got the cowmooflage seat  and is a very nice print! Not at all dingy looking as in the pictures on here...the black and white on the seat are very bright! My husband feels this seat is WAYYYY more sturdy and safer feeling compared to other seats on the market. He is a fireman so I trust his opinion! :-) We really love this seat and are so glad we picked this one! We decided on this one over the Marathon due to the click and safe feature and also the extra side impact protection headwings. Glad we did!! GREAT seat and worth every penny!!!",5
900 MHz Home Connection Monitor,"After not having any luck finding another monitor that would be compatible with the one I already had, I bought this one to monitor my infant,toddler and play rooms. It worked fantastic for the first 5 hours and then one reciever played static on all 3 rooms after I turned it off and back on again. The other receiver still worked, but why pay $130 and have part of it not work?  I tried all of the trouble shooting tips and this was not even mentioned. Also every 5 minutes or so, we would get a loud screech from one of the monitors. This probably because of too many other devices in our house and neighborhood that use 900 mhz and interfere. Our other one works great and uses only 49 mhz. I don't have the time or patience to call the Safety 1st customer service who will probably say to ship it back to the manufacturer to fix the 1 reciever. It's going back to the store not even 24 hours after buying it.  We are going to try one with more than 2 channels next to see if that solves the static problem.  But as far as one reciever not working at all, that is unacceptable.",1
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","Easy to assemble and adjust straps.  Trouble free setup in no time.  Easy to clean.  Nice, big tray.  Sturdy and attractive product.  Fits my 17 month old niece well.  Very convenient for babysitting duties.  With 8 chairs around the dining table, we didn't need to add a standard high chair.  Should have bought this sooner!",5

Munchkin Light My Way Nightlight,"We bought this night light when our 2-year-old started taking apart the regular table lamp in her room. So, first on the list was something child-proof -- check!  Batteries are accessible only by taking out the tiny screws in the lid on the bottom. Unless she somehow learns to correctly use a small screwdriver (ha!), there is no way she is taking this apart. Good.This runs on 3 AAA batteries, and after 8 months of using it every single day, it is still going on the original set. Even if I had to replace them by now, I would say it is very worth it because the light can be put anywhere. In the bed, on the bed shelf, on the dresser...it moves around a lot. Camping? No problem! Just bring it and it's another comfort of home right there with us. Plus, I used it myself to see in the tent without waking her up! It's also very easy to pack when we stay at someone else's house. Same reasons as camping. This is why I can honestly say we use it every single day.Other things I like:--It is durable. Little girl has hardwood floors in her room, and the owl has had its fair share of falls. But there are no cracks and it still works just fine. Some of the paint on the eyes/beak has rubbed off, but we don't mind.--The automatic shut off.  I love it. I wish more lights had this. Saves battery life, and one less thing for me to worry about. 20 minutes has been a good time, too, and if my girl is still awake, she easily turns it back on for another 20.--LED light means it does not get too warm...safe to snuggle with, even under blankets.--The handle is perfect for her (or me) to carry it around easily.--It is just plain cute! And my little girl loved it right from the start because of that.The actual light it gives is white and brighter than most night lights, but not as bright as a regular lamp. This is a positive/negative thing for me. I like that the light is nice and mellow and not so bright that it is distracting. But my little girl recently likes to look at her books in bed, and this light just isn't quite bright enough for that, unless it's extremely close to the page, which is hard for a toddler to manage while lying down. She just can't look at books with this light.So, I am looking for something brighter now, and she will probably end up using both. Maybe we can try another plug-in lamp now that she is getting older. I still give this 5 stars though, because it has been so good during this time -- it has been a daily must-have item, along with her pillow and special blanket. And it is not even very expensive, in my opinion, considering the use it has had. If I could find one exactly like this but brighter (and similarly well priced), I would buy it in a second.",5
Phil and Teds Dash Buggy With Doubles Kit Black,"We did a TON of research before buying a double stroller and after 2 months of online reviews and test driving strollers in-store we purchased the P&T; Dash Buggy Double in Black.When it arrived, I found not only did I have to assemble most of it, I was shocked to open the box and find that 3 things were broken or wrong with it.One of the plastic pieces used to connect the canopy to the stroller had snapped off, one of the black loops on the side of the seat was ripped and the front wheel well had the metal completely scratched off! I was disappointed and a little leery of exchanging it for a new one. If these pieces broke that easy in shipping how sturdy could it be and we spent $500 on this stroller!I returned it and even though I wanted a tandem double with a small footprint we ended up with the BOB Revolution Duallie. I must say we ended up getting it on sale for $454.99 (almost $50 less than the P&T;) and not only was it LESS than the Dash, but the quality is 100% better, it came assembled and even though it is much wider than the P&T; it is easier to maneuver.Hope this helps make someone else's decision easier!",2
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","Love these!  This is the only thing that my two and a half year old can't get through!  That being said, I have had to replace them a few times. They are plastic and if you drop them or slam the door and hit the piece just right, they will break. For the money and considering how expensive and completely ineffective everything else I have bought has been, I think these are great. One other thing to note - these will scratch your door jam slightly and you can't ever completely close the door when these are on - not a big deal though because it takes a second to take them off and put them back on.  To me, the most important thing is keeping my son safe so the good definitely outweighs any negatives about this product.",5
"Sassy No Scratch Bottle Brush, Colors May Vary","The very first time I used this product was my last. We have small mouth bottles and I thought this would do the trick to wash them. I liked how the nipple brush was designed so it could not be lost but it never made it that far. It was inserted into the first bottle for washing, the silicone head got stuck inside and when I tried to pull it out it ripped away from the brush leaving the silicone brush inside the bottle. With no way to re-attach it both pieces went straight to the trash can. What a waste!",1

"DaVinci Porter 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Cherry",I love the way this crib looks! My only complaint is that it seems to scratch and mark up very easily so teething protectors are a must have also the stickers all over it leave a horrible residue. But it seems to be durable enough to hold up to the years of use I expect to get out of it!,4
"Bumkins Waterproof Superbib, Blue Fizz","I use these bibs because you only need like 2-3 of them. They are easy to clean and dries fast - which is the most important factor for me. Unlike cloth ones, these don't stain and looks new after many, many uses.",5
Cloud B Tranquil Turtle - Aqua,"Great present for my grandson, he loved it so much with the sea on the ceiling and soothing ocean waves.

"Mobi Technologies Dualscan Ultra Thermometer, White/Blue","After reading mixed reviews I decided to try it myself because reviews can often be wrong one way or the other and there was an equal amount of good and bad. This thermometer was not accurate at all. The buttons really sucked so it was hard to get the thermometer to do what you wanted to do, they stuck and were hard to push. The flashlight did not work at all. Luckily it's a baby item so there's a 90 day return policy and I returned it.",1

Baby Einstein Discover and Play Activity Center,"Baby is now 7 mos old and continues to love this activity center.  We got it when he was 6 mos old and he was a little short even on the lowest height setting.  We had a 2 inch piece of foam and put it under his feet and he was so happy to practice standing and play with primarily the sun-face.  Now 1 month later he doesn't need the foam to stand up and touch the bottom.  He also stands in it for a long time squealing and laughing while spinning the circles and hitting the barnyard animal noise maker.  Love it, love it, love it.  He also can turn the seat 360 now to follow anyone who enters the room.",5

"Kissa's Wool Lover Diaper Cover, Natural, Small","I love this cover. I'd be excited to buy more but can't justify the price since I usually make my own.  It so soft and lovely. Good stretch. I will say that it's smaller than I expected. I had ordered it for Christmas but I was worried that the use I'd get from it would be severely limited by then. Maybe it'll grow with him more than that. I guess we'll see. I'm pretty happy using it right now anyway :). Very trim. My baby had a blowout in it (as in, it came out of his prefold, not the cover) and I was worried that it would be stained for good. I washed and washed and washed it and it didnt budge. But, putting it out in the sun to dry, the stain was 100% gone before it was even dry. Looked brand new. Very happy.",5
"Dream On Me Zodiak Portable Playard, Grey","The construction seem poor on the foundation. I use it about once a week for my grandson so it's okay, but if I had to use this for my 5 kids everyday when they were small, then I'd pass and purchase a better quality.

Lansinoh TheraPearl 3-in-1 Breast Therapy,"Was looking forward to using these once they arrived after reading a few reviews. First, I only used it for &#34;hot therapy&#34;. When I used it you have to throw them into these little sacks and keep them there so that it doesn't burn you. Well, the material might be too thick because you can't feel the heat once their in their little sack. I did use them for a few weeks (I'd say about 5-6 weeks) before they started to crack. I started finding the little pebbles on the floor. They're ok, but not the best.",2
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"Just received the stroller today and right when I opened the box I noticed the color.  The person that named this stroller color ""red stripe"" must be color blind.  This stroller is burgundy!  It is no were near ""red."" It's Aggie burgundy! Being a Longhorn fan, I am very disappointed!  Other than the color, I like the stroller but I agree with some of the other reviews on wishing the visor was adjustable.  I'm going to look into exchanging it for a different color.",4

Cotton Tale Designs Arctic Babies Musical Mobile,"I bought this to go along with the rest of the set and it is absolutely adorable! It is also very easy to set up. However, the first time I turned it on, it was so loud and has no volume control. It did not help my baby sleep it scared him. After trying it a few times he got use to the volume and does like it now. The loudness helps distract him from being upset and he falls asleep better (assuming this is why it is so loud.) The thing that really disappointed me is after using the mobile for about three weeks it started messing up, notes keep cutting out. You can't really tell what song it is trying to play now, it sounds like a cell phone with bad reception. We have only used it for two months and at this rate by four months it won't play any music at all. At least it will look pretty.",2
"The First Years Spinning Drying Rack, White",I hate the thought of putting my baby's bottles and items on the same dish rack we use.

I bought a second one to give to a friend because I liked it that much.,5

Lamaze Clutch Cube Take Along Toy,"Lamaze makes a very high quality soft toy.  Like the others my grandson has been given, the Clutch Cube Baby Toy is very well made.  The seams are securely sewn.  The different fabrics offer differing tactile experiences to stimulate baby's sense of touch.  The bright colors are visually stimulating.  The hard rings are wonderful for gumming when baby's teeth are coming in.  The hidden panel which opens to reveal a mirror provides the element of surprise to entertain baby.My only criticism is that this cube is rather large and is hard for younger infants to handle.  I question whether older infants who are large enough to handle this toy will find it interesting.  For a six month old who is very interested, this toy is just too large to handle and Grandma ends up manipulating it to entertain baby.",4

Lil Rinser Splashguard in Purple,The one drawback with this item is that you need 2 people.  Maybe when my daughters head grows we won't need 2 people but right now my husband has to put it on her head and put a little bit of pressure on the side so that no water goes onto her face or ears. But I still think its great when there is no crying when washing hair and it only takes about 15 seconds with a plastic cup to rinse and she's done.,4
"Lorex BB2411 2.4&quot; Sweet Peek Video Baby Monitor with IR Night Vision and Zoom, White","Nice picture, clear tunes, good range, easy setup. I am quite impressed with this item. To be honest I have only tested it with my wife because our son isn't here yet, but it works perfectly right now.",5

My grandsons looks great in there suits for church.",5

I'm not impressed. The last 3 orders from amazon have not been correct and there vendors they go through are going to make me chose other online shopping sites very soon. Hopefully these people are better than my last two purchases where the vendor that sold the item hung up on me multiple times even though I was being patient and polite. I just gave up on the last two orders. This one I hope I can get it switched for the CORRECT item. Haven't taken it out of the packaging but this error deserves a one star.

"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","I have to say that I'm surprised that I'm so pleased with this crib that I am actually taking the time (with 3 kids) to write a review.  My previous cribs have been more ""high dollar"" from Pottery Barn and I have been pleased with theirs as well, but this crib is really every bit as good and much easier to assemble.  Assembly took only about 20 minutes, the finish is really nice and the crib itself is really sturdy.  I also appreciate the fact that they didn't put the warning label stickers all over the visible area of the crib, which is what I experienced with my last Pottery Barn crib.  I truly could not be happier with this purchase-- don't let the low price fool you!",5
"Britax Parkway SG-2 Booster Car Seat, Pewter Dots","I got this an extra seat so my daughter could ride in our second car without us having to move the Britax Marathon, which can be kind of a pain. She's tall enough for it and just meets the weight requirement. She seems to fit in it well. When my son needed a booster a few years ago, the Britax models were too narrow for him. My daughter is slender compared to him and I think that is why this seat is a good fit for her.It was simple to assemble by sliding the back on the base and snapping it in place. It is lightweight and easy to put in the car. The padding is comfortable and the pattern is very nice. It has two arm rests, but they are short and a bit too low for my daughter to use. She does really like the cup holders. There is one on each side, so if you have a car seat next to this booster and it blocks the holder on that side, you can use the other. They are difficult for my daughter to pull out though if she is already seated; she pulls them out before climbing in. Her other complaint is that the slide guard bothers her legs. It is an inverted V and the straps press or rub against her thighs, particularly if she's wearing shorts. I think it is a nice safety feature to have though and I don't mind putting up with a few of her comments.It's designed for her to use with or without the back for a long time, so I'm sure we will get a lot of use out of this seat. Overall, it does the job and I am very pleased.",4
Ellie &amp; Luke (Brown) Diaper Bag with Changing Pad 6 Pieces Set,i brought this bag and am very please with it i would recommend it to any mother  who is looking for a baby bag to buy,5
Bright Starts Having a Ball Giggables - Elephant,"These toys are cute. And even though I could have found one at a specific retail store (they retail for $5.99) for half the price of what Amazon charges, I bit the bullet and bought one from Amazon.com anyway. When it got to the house, it sounded like a dying cat. It had been turned on before it was shipped and that poor elephant had giggled all the way from Amazon's warehouse to my doorstep. As you can imagine, it was pretty tired of giggling and the batteries completely died in the living room. So, not only did I spend $10 too much to BUY this toy, but now, I have to buy new batteries for it (and not cheap batteries either...those little round disc batteries!). I will be returning this toy to Amazon.com and I will be going to the retail store like I should have in the first place.I suppose that's more of a review on Amazon's poor skills though.The toy itself is cute. It's about the size of a tennis ball and makes goofy sounds when rolled across the floor. I thought that these made the respective animal sound when rolled, but they do not (at least the elephant does not). There is a little on/off button on the side which I think will prove dangerous for the toy if my drooly boy gets ahold of it and slobbers all over it. Other than that, it's worth the $6 you would pay for it in the retail store, but NOT worth the $15 that Amazon.com is charging, in my honest opinion.*****UPDATE*****After looking over the packaging again, I found that the batteries are not replaceable. I'm not sure what made me think they took watch batteries. Stress, maybe? So, now I have a dead elephant in my house. This is definitely being returned to Amazon! I still think this would make a great toy for young kids, but I'm decreasing my rating for durability. The toy is durable enough for those that like to throw things and are hard on toys, but batteries that aren't replaceable make it a toy that won't be played with after the batteries die and I'm not sure how long they actually last. Mine didn't make it more than the two day shipping period.",2
"Bumbleride Travel Bag for Flite, Black",Fits the flite perfectly and if you're going to spend that kind of money on an umbrella stroller it's worth getting this to protect your investment.  It's padded on the inside and is easy to carry with the straps.  I took this on a flight to Los Angeles from Tokyo roundtrip and my Bumbleride flight came back in perfect condition!  Not a scratch or dent which is amazing because I couldn't gate check this so I had to baggage claim it.  I highly recommend this if you are traveling by air.  I also like the idea that I'll have this to store my stroller until the next little one comes around.,5

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",I had the Baby Bjorn and the Moby wrap. Hands down this is way easier to use. My husband likes to wear him as well. I use it only for short periods of time while shopping. I was concerned about it hurting my back and the babies hips. So far there have been no issues but we don't use it for extended periods of time.Right now my little guy is 6 months old and about 18 lbs. We have only used it facing inwards but I am going to turn him outwards next time we are out. I do think it's difficult to bend over to pick things up. I'm always worried he will hit his head so you have to be cautious of that.,5
"Tommee Tippee Bottle, 9 Ounce, 3 Count","I have a breastfed baby who has also been taking bottles from very early on but has always stopped a lot to burp or fuss while taking bottles (particularly the Dr. Brown's).  I tried these out on a lark and she LOVES THEM.  Doesn't stop at all the whole bottle.  She does leak some around her face because she's eating so intensely, but I'm ok with that because she really really likes the bottles and has been very happy.  After fighting with the Dr. Browns for months and finding they made her MORE gassy because she didn't latch onto them well and swallowed a lot of air, I'm so happy to find these.  I'll take a messy face over an unhappy baby who has to stop 3-4 a bottle to burp that we had with Dr. Brown's.",5
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"I don't have too much to say about these...it's just a spoon, afterall.  I'll just say that my 7 month old doesn't care for this spoon.  She prefers the Gerber baby spoons.  I think it's because they are more shallow then these deeper spoons.",3
"MAM Trends Silicone Pacifier, Blue, 0-6 Months, 2-Count","Our daughter is two months old and has been using these pacifiers since the first few weeks of life. Unlike other pacifiers that we have bought (soothers, etc), the outside of these pacifiers are not heavy and fit well against the newborn/infants face and mouth, therefore they don't fall out as easily when they stop sucking. Also, the holes along the edges make it easy to attach to a pacifier clip and attach to a seat or the babies clothing. A must for new babies!",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Video Camera,"We liked this product until after 7 months, the picture on the monitor would go black or green lines and the sound would go out.  As far as we can tell, it is the camera side that is bad, not the parent unit.  It was a gift and so we don't have a receipt.  We are wondering if purchasing another camera is our best option?",3
"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Froggy","I bought 2 of these for my girl twins and they love them.  The cuteness of the potties attracted them immediately and they rarely have accident using the froggy potty.  The potties are easy to take from room to room, empty and clean.  Overall, the froggy potty is a great value.",5
"Hook 'n' Stroll Stroller Accessory, Black","These have a lifesaver since the moment I attached them to my stroller! I have tested them holding groceries walking through my neighborhood, holding clothing at the mall, and holding all my bags on a trip to the park. They can hold a very surprising amount of weight, to the point where if I remove my kids the stroller tips backward and that shouldn't be possible being that it's a double stroller. I would definitely recommend these to anyone with a need for two more hands :).",5
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"This is the perfect travel size to drop in a purse and keep as a backup toy. My nephew loved it when he was younger, my sister would keep it hidden in her purse for when they were traveling, then bring it out for him if he started getting wound up. Since he didn't get it often it worked like a charm at the times she needed it to most!",4
"Diono RadianR120 Convertible Car Seat, Storm","WOW!  This car seat just seems to jump out from among the rest I looked at.  We were in need of something that would grow with our children.  This seat does that wonderfully as it will hold infants rear facing, older children forward facing and then changes into a booster seat.  Another hurdle for us was the fact that we drive a smaller Jeep Cherokee which does not have a lot of room in the back seat.  We needed two car seats and one booster seat to fit three across.  With the slightly narrower frame, the R120 fits wonderfully.  We laughed that there was the option for more than one cup holder but it is nice for our son to have his drink in one and snacks in another; or his favorite toys sitting close at hand.  The foldable feature came in handy when we recently had to fly across country.  I did not have to worry about it getting all beat up and banged up or the straps damaged because it folded up and protected itself.  Yes, this is a slightly more expensive car seat but you can not cheapen quality.  It is definitely worth every penny!",5
Evenflo Big Kid No Back Booster - Cobalt,My kids love the seat and cup holder. They also love putting things in the extra compartment. They sit secure and tell me its comfortable. No complaints so far.,5
Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up,"This way one of the most helpful products in our potty training experience. It is not terribly sturdy, but if you put a bath mat under the legs, it helps. This really motivated my son to start potty training, so I suggest it. They can climb up easily and hold on to the sides. I recommend supervision.",4
Infantino Sash Mei Tai Carrier Black/Gray,"I'm VERY surprised by this mei tai! My son is a month old and 10 1/2 lbs and it works awesome. I've had the k'tan and a sling and didn't like either. I LOVE this carrier. I wanted a babyhawk but couldn't afford it at the moment so got this based on all the great reviews, still nervous about it. I'm so glad I did. I feel secure enough to be hands free (don't with the k'tan as much). Baby loves it, he fell asleep within 5 minutes of being it it. He hates being put down so this will be a lifesaver. I'm not sure how this will be with an older child, it's a great concept so we'll see, but I may want something more supportive on my end (it's fine for them I feel). This is well worth the money and I highly recommend it. If you're baby hates being face in, this may not be for you. My son only wants to be face in, he hates if I cradle hold him of hold him on my side, so this is wonderful. If you are unsure about a mei tai, this is the perfect buy. It's convinced me to love them. It's super cute too! Babies r us has the other design. Enjoy!!!",4
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"This baby monitor is a life saver. Had to spend so much else on baby stuff like the crib, pram, bottles, toys, didn't want to spend a few hundred more on a digital video monitor! I can tell exactly when my baby is crying with this machine, there is no fuzziness and very little lag, everything on the screen is very easy to distinguish! Love how both the brightness and volume are adjustable so that I can turn all the settings lower when it is night time and I am trying to sleep, and turn it up when I am up doing chores. Everything is very plastic like but it is still strong, managed to step over it quite heavily the other day when it was lying on the floor and it didn't come close to cracking! I bought this when it was on sale at $99.99 on amazon and the deals here on amazon are just getting better and better.",5
Tender CSR 2007 Stroller,"After searching through many doubles, I found this stroller.  Its wonderful.  It has a smooth ride, easy to steer (even with two kids loaded in, I can steer it with one hand).  The sunshades are awesome!!  You can unzip the backs of the sunshades for good air flow on hot days.  And if the infant falls asleep in his infant car seat, i can cover him completely out of the sun/weather.  Plus, it has an interesting adjustable handle.  My 6 ft hubby doesn't mind using it.  Cons:  if the car seat is in the stroller, my toddler in the front seat can't recline at all..not good if you have a hefty sized toddler.  Won't be a problem if you don't use the matching car seat.  The seats recline nicely, very easily.  Its a little annoying to keep it collapsed when I'm done with it - if you don't fold it up just right, the stroller won't stay closed - it pops open when I lift it in the car (my husband hates that part). Plus for the price, I'd expect a nice parent tray or cupholder - I don't even use the weak cupholder that came with it (it pops off easily and looks like the designer made it an afterthought - its really cheap looking).  And it has almost no storage - the little bit i have will be lost once the baby grows and uses the footrest.  Makes it hard to carry a purse/diaper bag, a drink and shopping bags.  I have considered buying the matching the diaper bag - it has hooks specifically for the diaperbag, but the bag is stiff looking - and masculine.  Overall though, it's an awesome stroller.  Fits in any place a single tandem would fit...Lighter than most doubles, fairly compact, easy to fold but has poor room for storage or cupholders.  I have a minivan and it can fit standing upwards, as well as on its side, or flat without a problem...I think it would fit in a larger trunk - like a Honda Accord sized trunk, but if you have a small car I doubt it would fit.",4
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Apple, Infant",I love the Bundle Me! It's makes going in the carseat and stroller so easy in cold weather. They are very plush and wash well. No bulky blankets and jackets. The toddler size is a little big with the infant carseats but worth it to continue on into toddler seats and strollers.,5
My Precious Baby Educational Bubbles,I bought these balls for my 1 year old son because he loves balls and I figured any educational balls would be a great addition.  I just wish they had the entire alphabet and number set. He loves throwing them around and then checking to see which side is facing up.,4
"Bumkins Reusable Sandwich and Snack Bag, Bright Blue, Large","I'm not a toddler. Captain Obvious here! But I tried this out because I bring snacks with me to work everyday.I love the Dr. Seuss print. t's very colorful and just plain cute! I guess I just can't get the idea of using and reusing.I know this isn't the most ""green"" thing to say. But I just feel like $5 for one bag that you're constantly washing out,well I guess it's just not for me. But the quality is good. It withstood all the washings!",3
"OXO Tot Snack Disk, Green","I love OXO products so I was thrilled to find their baby/kids line. I despise babyish looking items in pinks with cartoon characters on them, so it was very refreshing to find this OXO snack cup in a gorgeous bright green with a modern look. Finally a snack cup that doesn't scream ""baby!"" The cup itself is extremely durable and has survived numerous falls. The lid always stays intact during the falls, ensuring no snacks are lost. I love the rubber bottom to prevent sliding and I love how the top portion is clear on the outside so you can see what is inside. The size is perfect for our kids to hold and reach their little hands into to feed themselves. The only gripe I have is that I wish there was some sort of leash to attach the lid to the cup.  Our kids have misplaced the lids numerous times and its really frustrating not to be able to use the cup because you can't locate the lid. Other than that, it's another perfect OXO product.",4
Boppy Newborn Lounger,This lounger is the perfect place for an infant. It's just the right angle and snugness. Our 8 week old sleeps swaddled on this. He has acid reflux and the position is great for him. He cannot sleep flat on his back because of the pain associated with his reflux. This is definitely my favorite and most used baby product!,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I purchased several of these for the grandchildren, and liked them so much; I ordered one for myself.  It puts stars all over the ceiling, and the walls.  The power went out the other night, and it was great having the light of the stars.  A great gift for kids of all ages.  I love mine.",5
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"The truth be told, yes the volume is low.  It is not supposed to be a stereo system.  This is a perfect thing to have for a childs crib.  It shows them that music doesn't have to be blareing to be enjoyable and also this product isnt supposed to be used for loud music anyway.  That is why it is made for a crib!! To be soft and soothing, to lull your baby to sleep.  So for those who want a stereo type system to play music in the room i would suggest that you buy just that.  My baby goes to sleep more easily with the soft classical music playing. Oh! and another beautiful option.......you can change the cd's to whatever you want.  Unlike mobiles that only play selected songs over and over and over again.  As far as the batteries i have had this for 3 months and only had to change them one time and that was recent.  So inconclusion i would recommend this product.",5
Kidalog Baby Food Mill Grinder,"Love this food mill. We use it for the pureed food needed for a G-tube diet.  It would also be perfect for baby food.We have also used the Cuisinart mini chopper, the small size stainless old-fashioned food mill, the Magic Bullet, and the Munchkin food mill.My assessments:1. Cuisinart mini chopper: great for bigger tasks and for pureeing larger amounts to a smooth consistency2. Small Stainless old-fashioned food mill: does a great job, but too much food loss and trouble for small servings3. Magic Bullet: does not do small (1/4-1/2 cup) servings well.  Things get stuck to the sides and it doesn't puree them4. Munchkin food mill: lighter-weight than the Kidalog, blade pops out more easily ending up in a big mess, blades don't grind things like chicken and fish well.  The Kidalog grinds a variety of foods more easily.The Kidalog is the best when comparing the Munchkin to the Kidalog food mills because:The Kidalog is sturdier, has a wider more stable base; it does not leak; the center grinding disk stays in place well while grinding (Only turn crank Clockwise, as with the Munchkin, if you turn the crank the other direction, the grinding disk will be released ending up in a mess); he blade works better than the Munchkin ( I can't figure out why, but it works better); the Kidalog has a clear cover than can be placed on top as you grind which is usefulfor things that might squirt like blueberries.Easy to clean, no spots where food gets stuck.Suggestions:Gently press down on the base while you grind, allowing the blades to do the work especially on meats or items that are tougher. (This was a good suggestion from another reviewer).  Just stick to cranking Clockwise and all will work well.Takes a few more days to receive from Canada, but it is worth the wait!  I was impatient and bought the Munchkin first.",5
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!","These are great blankets.  Nice and big for swaddling.  Super soft, cute patterns, and lightweight.  Love them and would be a great gift for an expectant mom.",5
Tommee Tippee Electric Steam Sterilizer,"This is really handy.  I don't know if it's for everyone, but it is nice to stay there on the counter, put in some bottles, add water, turn it on and then 5 minutes later, sterilized bottles.  A whole lot quicker than boiling a pot of water, and those microwave bags are only good for a few uses.  Just de-scale once a month and your done.  It does make it easy.Only issue is that while other things can be put in there, the racks are designed for the Tommee Tippee bottles only.",4
Co-Pilot Model A Trailer,"This trailer is great. I recently bought this trailer over the Schwinn Spirit as it's features are by far better for a little more then $60 dollars more you get a light but sturdy steel frame with shock resistance shock on the trailer arm a padded seat over a nylon with a 5 point restraints with little holders Vs a aluminum frame & nylon seat & floor. Your kid basically sits on a nylon pad. Not bad really but the aluminum on this trailer tends to have it's issues and good luck getting parts. For me I just think it's well worth the $60 extra dollars for a much better product over all. I like the Schwinn and I certainly like the Cadillac of trailers but for a relative medium you can't go wrong with the CoPilot Model """"A"""". The model """"T"""" is pretty nice too but a little bit more then we was willing to spend.",5
Sesame Street Meal and Play Mat,The mat was very cute and colorful but too thin and i was afraid that the highchair will make holes through the mat. Unfortunately i had to return the product.,1
"Boba 3G Baby Carrier, Montenegro Black","My baby is 5 weeks old and we've now used this carrier on 5 or 6 outings, namely dog walks. My baby was born large - 9 lbs, 10 ozs., so he was already heading out of the infant size requirements, but he still needs them, and the flexibility of this carrier for under 15 lbs. babies, along with the ability for a taller person to use it (my husband is 6'3&#34;) made this model really attractive to us (we didn't want to spend all the extra money on the infant insert and extra straps for taller people). This is really easy to put on and take off, even when you're by yourself, and my baby seems pretty happy in it (word to the wise, if you're using pacifiers, put one in your pocket so if the baby fusses when in the carrier, you can soothe him/her with the pacifier really easily).I was surprised at how high the baby sits when it's set up for the under 15 lbs. babies - I thought his neck would be a little more supported by the material, but his head seems to rest mostly above the canvas material, so I kind of hold it to keep him from bobbling around too much. I don't mind, but if you wanted a truly hands-free option, you might want to test-drive this before you commit.The colors and materials look just like they look online - I love it for my little boy, but definitely appropriate for either sex of child. Instructions are easy to follow. I got this as a gift, but had chosen it for my registry because of the things I outlined above and the price, and I'm still pretty happy with the decision.",5
"Cozy Infant Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Optic Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt and Zoom, 3.5 Inch","Pan And Tilt : Works fast and adds allot of convenience , the 3.5&#34;Bright screen lets me have better view , and its very nice and clear .I also found a very nice feature since we have 2 thermostats in ourhouse 1 for downstairs and 1 for upstairs , so when my baby takes hisdaily nap I can always monitor the temperature in his room with thenice feature that this monitor has, to always give me the roomtemperature on the monitor . I would like to mention 1 small issuethat I had and solved it so if you experience the same you know whatto do , usually it is not necessary to pair the camera to the monitorbecause it comes pared from the factory , only if you want to addadditional cameras ( it works up to 4 cameras ) or if you accidentallydelete the camera [ thats what happened to me ] so let me explain howto pare it since it took me a few minutes to figure it out. Firstswitch on the camera , then switch on the monitor , press the menubutton which is the top left button then on the screen to the bottomyou will see 7 options , choose the second to the right you choose bythe arrow buttons , then choose &#34; add&#34; then choose camera 1 , but hereis a little tricky when you choose camera 1 the screen will tell youto &#34; press pairing mode &#34; this is the &#34;on &#34; button on the camera , butonly press it for 1 second and leave it off right away then it shouldpare , don't press it for longer then that because it will switch offthe camera , the user manual says 2 seconds but thats to long , alsoif the light is red then that means you switched off the camera (because you pressed it to long) it hasto be orange and then you can pare it by pressing the &#34;on&#34; button for 1second , it will then blink fast and pare .Also if you set the screen to switch off and you only leave the sound, if the camera detects motion it will automaticity go back on witchis good so you see what the motion is . Other then that paring issueI don't have much to say to &#34; Cozy Infant &#34; other then you did agreat job by producing a rich nice baby monitor for a good price ,keep it up !!!!!! and it deserves a 5 star",5
"Summer Infant Slumbersack Longsleeve Microfleece, Blue Star","Baby grandson sleeps very comfortable in this sleeper. It seems a little longer then most, so he is able to have his legs free, but stays covered and warm. Love it !",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","I had a different brand before, it was not as sturdy as this one.  Set up was super easy even for me.  I HIGHLY reccomend it",5
"Prince Lionheart playMAT, ABC","We were looking for a large play mat for our 8 month old son to keep him off the rental carpet.  This play mat is definitely large.  My husband, my son, and I can easily play on it together.  The thickness is about as thick as a foam place mat and it works great on the carpet.  I think this would be a great product to have on hard surface flooring to provide a little padding when crawling around.  If you are looking for something a little thicker, Prince Lionheart makes this same mat with thicker foam called the play mat plus.  I didn't feel it was necessary to spend the extra money because by the time we move and hopefully no longer have carpet, my son will not longer be rolling around and trying to sit up.  As far as other mats, I can't stand the ones that link together because I didn't want to deal with the mess after my son tore them apart.  Also, I really am not a fan of the crazy colors.  I know that sounds crazy because this mat is very colorful but I think the colors serve a purpose.  The roads and farm encourages play and it is very cute.  It folds up easily and can be put away quickly unlike the mats that link together.  If you have pets that have claws that may get on this mat, I would advise you to look for a different product.  The instructions even say not to use high heels, etc. on the mat.  The only negative I can really say about the mat is it does move around on the carpet a little and I find that I'm having to move it a few times a day.  Not a huge deal, but thought I'd mention it.  If I had it on hard surface flooring, I would probably try a rug backing.  One last thing - super easy to clean.  It has had all sorts of baby mess on it and wipes clean.",5
"Silikids Universal Standard Large Siliskin, Lime","I chose to use glass bottles for fear of toxins (bpa) found in plastic bottles.The ""Siliskin"" fits over the bottles and protects from breakage if dropped or for protecting the diaper bag as well if packing one or more glass bottles on outings to parks, zoo ect. and the look is quite cute.",5
RiNGLEY Natural Teething Toy (Straight),"This teething ring is made very well. The materials seem high quality. Unfortunately, my son really goes for color, which I realized after I purchased this and he seemed to have little interest in it.  He uses it once in a while, but he's definitely not attracted to it. Too bad, because I would prefer he chew on something organic.",3
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,This thing is junk and a waste of space. It does not twist correctly. The inside also smells like pee and poop no matter how much I clean it. Don't waste the money.,1
"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss T-Shirt, Cat In The Hat, Blue, 18 Months","I bought this for a baby (girl) gift along with a few other Dr. Seuss items. It was a great addition to the Dr. Seuss theme I was going for, and the larger size (18 months) was greatly appreciated, because they could look forward to their baby wearing it later on vs. all the newborn or younger sizes people receive as baby gifts.",5
"NUK Gerber GraduatesFun Grips Trainer Cups, Boy, 7 Ounce, 4-Count","We have used these cups for years with my son, now I bought these for my daughter. They are great, except one of the cups in the set leaks 2 out of 3 times we use it. I have to keep taking the spout out and putting it back in to make it stop leaking. Maybe the spout so defective. I know they sell replacement spouts in our local store. Overall these are my favorite cups.",4
Boppy Water Resistant Protective Cover,"I use my boppy pillow every day. Is great for nursing and holding my newborn.  This cover is very soft, great for baby's delicate skin.  Works wonders to keep your pillow stain free and all stains are gone after you put it in the washer.",5
Evenflo ExerSaucer Triple Fun - Jungle,"PROS:Great little floor mat- entertained baby from 2-4 months.Okay as chair for a short while, to keep baby entertained and out of the way (if you need to get something done).He loved being able to spin in it and that it bounces.Arch with koala and butterfly and dragon fly are interesting to baby.  Parrot is sometimes too.Baby liked to teeth on butterfly, and dragon fly was his favorite.  He tried to gum the other items, but obviously these were not super satisfying as they didn't fit in his mouth as well.Fold into flat disc when you need to put it away (for long term storage. Would be time-consuming for everyday clean up).CONS:We usually had to take the dragon fly out of its perch because he had to pull with all his might to reach it to his mouth.Not for tall children- will outgrow it quickly.Bird trio is pointless.  They don't do anything that baby can do (one's head bops, but you have to be older to ""operate"").World and Chameleon just play LOUD music, even on lowest setting.Alligator not interesting to baby.  May become interesting after first birthday, when he's able assemble the ""puzzle"".Chameleon and Globe require batteries and are pointless without.  Alligator also requires batteries (though could use without).In third stage it's RIDICULOUSLY UNSTABLE.  It totally wobbles and as soon as baby leaned on it, it toppled over.  What a joke.",3
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,my 5mth old daughter really likes this teething toy. it has just the right amount of vibration and it triggered easily enough where she can activate it herself with little effort. i like that the 3 sides of the star have different ribbing so it feels different on her gums. great product for the money and a must have for a teething baby.,5

"Bestever Baby Mat, Pink Bear","I don't have any children yet, but I have given the lamb to two friends and the giraffe to two others and they absolutely love it!!

"Graco Lauren Dressing Table, White","Initially my husband and I decided not to get a changing table.  But bringing my 20 month old into our room and changing her on the floor became tired quickly.  And now that I am currently 16 weeks pregnant, changing her on the floor slowly became no an option for me.  I've looked high and low for a nice decent changing table for a fair price.Pros:Goes great with my toddlers decor (other furniture is made by Carter's)I love the different shelvesPurchased from Amazon for $69.99; it's currently priced at $99.99 at Babies-R-UsHolds children up to 30 lbs (My daughter is 19 pounds 14 ounces, so we have some time with this product)Ship to our house two days after purchasingDid not take my husband long to put the changing table togetherThis item can be re-purposed for a shelf somewhere else in the house one day.Cons:The one locking wheel does not lockOverall great product for the price; I wish I would have found this sooner...",5
Klean Kanteen 18 oz Stainless Steel Water Bottle (Sport Cap 2.0) - Indicator Red,"This water bottle is used by my preschool son every day. The sport cap is leaking badly when I put sparkling water in it, but I have never seen one that didn't. Apart from that I am satisfied and my son is too.",4

"Supergate Extra-Wide Gate, Ivory","We bought the gate to keep our kids out of the kitchen while we cooked dinner.  You get what you pay for!  Not the most sturdy gate and our walls are angled so makes it difficult to latch closed.  Not bad, but not sure I would buy it again.",3
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","This gate is awesome! I read too many reviews before deciding on the one. Look no further!!!!I had used a few at friends houses and hated the ones with the latches on the top... they were hard to open. The latch on the bottom of this one is so easy to use, but the kids can't figure it out. Actually most adults that come over can't figure it out either :)Very sturdy. My daughter is very gentle and doesn't pull or hang on it (she is 2), but I have had some hellians over that have practically tried to rip it down and it held up just fine! Very durable. We have been using this at the top of the stairs with the included hardware for 6 months now. We did not drill into the wall or anything and the nice sticker/adhesive parts have worked very well!",5

Safety 1st Prograde Complete Family Thermometer,"We've only used the rectal attachment for our baby (now 10 months). It is very unreliable. Frequently, we will take his temperature and then take it again 30 seconds later & the readings are sometimes vastly different.  When your baby is sick, you don't want the uncertainty of not knowing if there's fever or how high the fever is. I am now looking for something more reliable.",1
"OXO Tot Whale Pail, Blue",Like the 2 different ways to attach (suction or sticky tabs) the back piece. I was not aware it was two separate pieces when i purchased it but it makes sense to be that way. the feet on the bottom of the mounting piece also work well for holding up the weight. drains well with the 3 separate areas to drain. very happy.,5
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","Our baby loves all things shiny. Which means he was fascinated with the bathtub spout. Unfortunately, one day he stood up beneath it and got scratched by it. That is when we found Moby the spout cover. Moby was very easy to install and slips right onto the spout. We live in an apartment so we have the basic standard faucet which Moby was designed for. Moby has a clever design (hole for shower pull and slit down middle) which allows it to slip right on the faucet. Moby's mouth goes low enough that the baby is well protected from future scraps. Moby fits snug on the faucet and so far our baby has not figured out how to remove Moby. Our baby loves the little whale and will often speak whale to it. OoooooOOOOoooo! I think they are getting along quite well.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Safety Harness, Monkey",It was surprisingly bigger than I though but that made me happy. My daughter won't wear it very long but we will keep trying. It is very handy if you are just going on a short trip and want to not lug around a diaper bag or to just keep snacks and toys separate. We also used it on our flight from the West coast to the East. But it ended up being more of a pain to keep track of. Hopefully as she gets bigger she will like it better. She does like to play with it for now.,3
Vulli Products - Sophie The Giraffe Teething Ring - Gift Boxed! - 100% Natural rubber,"I've had the original Sophie for both my daughter and my son and LOVED them. This teething ring version was suggested and I thought I'd give it a try since we're such a ""Pro-Sophie"" family. My son is four months old and teething big time. I got this delivered yesterday and he has been non stop gnawing on it. There is drool EVERYWHERE. It's great for his small hands to be able to hold and much easier than the regular Sophie. (Although he still loves her too) I'll be recommending this to friends from now on! Oh, and the packaging it comes in is super cute as well. :)",5
Russ Berrie Pregnancy Calendar,"The calendar was given to me as a gift. It's functional and serves its purpose but could use some improving. It seems a bit out dated for my taste, as if it was designed nearly 50 years ago. Because you have to fill in the dates, Sunday isn't always on the left where a traditional calendar would place it. The stickers are an adorable feature, but it's for those mom's to be who are looking for a more medical pregnancy labor and delivery. I liked that it would tell me the fetal development but when I purchase another pregnancy calendar I will not be getting this calendar.",4
Levana LV-TW502 Safe N' See Advanced 3.5-Inch Digital Video Wireless Baby Monitor with Talk to Baby Intercom and Remote Controlled Lullabies,"Wireless camera is great and the video control panel handheld is just great! Quality is very good considering it is wireless and handheld runs on batteries. You can talk to baby wirelessly, it has an included remote control and even has a nightlight! It has night vision so you can check up on baby when it's dark, controls can be voice controlled (just be sure to not speak too fast and clearly and it works 100% flawless) It even has a temperature monitor and even plays 5 included lullabies! Setup is fast and easy and you will be spying on baby in no time! For the price I do not think this can be beat as it works better and has tons more features of the same other products that cost 2,3,4 times as much!",5
"Graco Pack N Play Playard with Bassinet, Pasadena","Easy and simple! Love it for traveling and overnights at the grandparents house! No extras are needed, it's great! Would recommend to anyone",4
Chewbeads Necklace - Jane - Black,"I purchased this product because it looked more attractive in the picture than the Teething Bling I used with my daughter. I was wrong. I'm a little embarrassed to wear this necklace because it really does just look like a big teething ring. Plus baby likes the Teething Bling better, go figure.Don't spend the extra money on Chewbeads. This product is just too much rubber for any one person's neck.",2
Baby Trend Activity Walker,"Our daughter is 8 months old and we found this walker to be very very short. We put it on the highest setting and she was still walking around with bent knees. Also the wheel's are small and the square plastic base of the walker is low making it impossible to make it over a tiny lip of a thin area rug from hardwood floor. We bought Safety 1st Sounds 'N Lights Activity Walker and its much taller.  However the two giant giraffe's on the front of the walker prevented a lamp form falling on my daughter so for that I am very grateful. There is also a very nice tray on the front for snacks and the walker overall was well constructed, just too short.",2
Isabella 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set by Glenna Jean,"We would like to pay a little more for quality. This set is very pretty and elegant. It makes the crib look incredible., We got a lot compliments.",5
"American Baby Company Organic Cotton Velour Fitted Contoured Changing Pad Cover, Mocha",This Velour contoured changing cover is very soft & it washes up nicely. It fits the contoured pad the way it should. I am also impressed with the company and the way my ordered was processed and received. They have a great name and a cute picture frame magnet that I now have on my fridge to help me remember where to order from the next time a I need an item like this.,5
Mommy's Helper Tip Resistant Furniture Safety Brackets,"I used this to hold up a bookcase, especially with little children around. Better to be safe than sorry.  Easy to install.",5
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Night and Day Discovery Toy,"Just as adorable as shown in picture, maybe even more so. This item arrived a day early and was in perfect condition. Will make a great gift for christmas, I think my niece will just love it!",5
"Toilet Seat Covers- Disposable XL Potty Seat Covers, Individually Wrapped by Potty Shields - Extra-Large, No Slip (Floral- 6 Pack)",These are so convienient and the simple packaging makes taking a single cover where ever you go easy.  Definitely recommended.,5
"Itzy Ritzy Shopping Cart and High Chair Cover, Avocado Damask","The pattern on this is so cute. I gave it 5 stars mainly based on that. It does its job, nothing really spectacular about it except its so cute and soft. The rings to hang toys on are definitely handy. Fits on most carts. Doesn't fold back up very easily but that's because it is very cushiony.",5
"Thirsties Duo Wrap, Honeydew, Size Two (18-40 lbs)","I needed to replace a worn out cover and bought one of these to try with my son. After three babies in cloth diapers, I have tried quite a few different brands and this is one of the better diaper covers. I like these better than the Bummis Super Whisper Wrap because the cut seems to fit my baby better around the legs. It fits nicely and doesn't gap around the legs, but hasn't left any red marks, either (my son has very chubby legs). I use it both with prefolds and with bumGenius fitted bamboo diapers. The cover is much trimmer than other covers I've tried and fits pretty well under his clothes. The blackbird pattern is super cute, and I also love the adjustable rise. I bought the larger size and am optimistic that it will last up to 40 pounds. My son is 24 pounds and it looks like he has plenty of room to grow. My only drawback is the price....although it's very competitively priced with similar diaper covers, it's still a chunk of money. I would have made the investment if I was buying them for my first baby, but as this is for my last baby, I'll probably only buy one or two more as I need to replace worn out covers.",4
CoCaLo Once Upon A Pond Plush Turtle,I bought this for my sister in law and she just adores it! My niece even tries to steal it from her!,5
"Tubing for Medela Lactina, Symphony and Pump in Style Breast Pumps. Retail Pack, 2pc/pack. BPA Free, Replacement of Medela Tubing Part# 8007213, 8007194, 8007179, 87214, 87213",Works the same as the medela brand tubing.  No compatibility issues though there is a slight design difference compared to the brand name version.  They are a good value for the money.,5
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,A must have for your baby he will love itthe color doesn't go out A 5 star quality and the baby can hold it easily . I order many other Teether but this is the best one I will order another one as a gift to my friend baby,5
"Dr. Sears Smoothie Sipper, Green, 18 Months","This works really well for smoothies and other foods that are more difficult to feed from a spoon because of being too liquid-y. My only complaint is that if there's only a little bit in the bottle, it's harder to get, and my daughter is only 9 months old and doesn't need a full bottle full of smoothie. I find that I have to put in twice as much as she would eat just to make sure she's able to get it, and that means a lot is wasted.I know there were a lot of complaints about the straw, but my daughter doesn't have teeth enough yet to cause any damage and she doesn't seem to bite the straw so that doesn't affect us (yet).",4
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,I received it very promptly but I really have not had a chance to use it yet as my situation has changed. I hope to be able to use it very soon.,4
Bright Starts Grab and Spin Rattle,out of the box my daughter choose this toy out of all the rest some thing so simple its amazing,4
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Jumperoo,"Our little 5 month old can't get enough of this thing. She absolutely loves it - bouncing around in it, fooling around with all the little gizmos on the side. It's a great way to keep her in one place or to tire her out.The reason I gave it four stars was simply because it should have come with an AC Adapter, instead it uses batteries, and it blows through them like crazy. The first week we went through 8 AA batteries before I decided to buy rechargeable ones. We're still changing them every few days and I simply leave the battery cover off so I don't have to fiddle with the screws that hold the cover in place.Overall, a great product, but the battery issue should have been addressed by Fisher Price.",4
Barefoot Dreams Hello Kitty CozyChic Mini Blanket,"But quite tiny in size. I hope my granddaughter carries it around when she's older, because way too tiny to use as a blanket.  So soft tho, just a little disappointed on size for cost.",4
Garanimals Wooden Stacking Rings,Terrible toy.  I bought this for my child this weekend and already the toy looks like I've had it for years.  It is not durable and the paint chips off.  That can't be safe.  My child will no longer be playing with this.,1
"Similac infant nipples &amp; rings, Standard Flow, Ready To Use, Case of 25",Fits the newborn formula bottles they give in the hospital. Helpful for nighttime feedings. You don't have to wash them. Just open a new one every day. They aren't recommended for multiple uses.,5
NUK OrthoStar Design Pacifiers Boys Color (2pk),My son loved pacifiers when he was little and these were his favorite. I found they stayed in his mouth the best.,5
"Dr. Brown's Protective Bottle Sleeve (4 oz), 4 Pack - Pink",A little more difficult to heat evenly but good for around tile counter tops. the baby can even get a better grip,5
NUK Barely There Nipple Shield with Case,"Only bought for the case.  For the price, it's great for this--just used my Medela nip shield, which is far superior but doesn't have its own case.",2
Sassy Developmental Rock And Roll Infant Play Gym,"The rock and roll gym musical star will last a few weeks.  Our's started to act up after about two weeks and now doesn't work at all.  You would think that you can open the zipper compartment and just replace the battery, but unfortunately it's not even a zipper compartment.  I cut the star open to search for a battery and there is no battery that a consumer could replace.  Save the money and hassle and buy one from either Fisher Price or Tiny Love.",1
"Orbelle 3-6T Toddler Bed, Natural","Great for the price, not to difficult to put together. Only negative is that are boy is 3 and will grow out of this bed within a year or two. It's perfect for a quick fix.",4
Easy Folding Travel Potty,"I keep this potty in the back of my van and really appreciate that I don't have to look for a gas station when I'm out and about with my children. My kids range in age from 7 down to 1, so it is great to set up the potty in the back of the van and not have to haul all four of them into a random store to ask for a bathroom.  It is so easy to use, it makes pit stops quick and simple.",5
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","This has been an often used item for our little one. Good for fun, especially when he was small. Kept him entertained and sitting with us. Great as a make shift high chair on the floor in the living room. I haven't used it as a booster yet but it has been fun and practical for us. Very useful!",5
Mod Ladybug 4-Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set,"Absolutely love this bedding, it's super cute and you don't see lady bugs often! I love how the blanket is not real thick, my sons was thick and we did not use it but this one is like a quilt and I think we will use it when she is like 6 months or so..great quality, nice and soft..would recomend this bedding to anyone looking for something different..we bought the 4 pc crib set and mobile, we also got the curtain..so cute but does not come with the pok a dot curtains just the top one, I love it though!",5
Flip-Down Child View Mirror,It was a pain to get on and only works well with thicker mirrors.  The straps fit into the grooves on the safety first mirror and the hooks hook onto the bottom side of your vehicles rearview mirror.  It's a tight fit but stays in place well.  Hope this helps :),5
"Medela Tubing for Pump In Style Original &amp; Advanced breast pumps #87212, retail pack of 2","The tubes work just fine. I've been using them for a month without issue. The problem is I get milk in them almost every time, and I never had a problem like that with my Medela brand tubing. I wonder if they are just a little bit wider, allowing the milk in. I have to clean them after every use, which is tiresome. Should have paid for the Medela tubes which are over priced, but less hassle.",3
"Baby Bottle Labels, Self-laminating - Great for Daycare","this is a great product , very very helpful..my wife was so happy - the stickers are on bottles/lunch containers for about couple of months..and still not coming off. awesome",5
Better Bath Ultimat Bath Mat (Clear) 39 1/2&quot; long x 16&quot; wide,This is a great bath mat that fits the entire length of the tub.  Minor drawback-You do have to hang it up to dry after each use or else it will mildew very quickly.,5
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","I bought this when pregnancy forced me to start sleeping on my side.  I've never been a side sleeper and initially tried wedging normal pillows around me.  That didn't work so I eventually sought out this fabulous item.  It has literally made the difference between me being well rested or exhausted and uncomfortable all night long.  I was initially concerned because of the seam issue raised in a previous review.  However, when the pillow arrived, I found that although the seam might be uncomfortable, the issue was 100% resolved simply by placing a pillow on top of this one in the area where your head will go - thus covering the seam and eliminating any potential discomfort.  The pillow is large - if you have anything smaller than a queen sized bed you or your partner might need a new place to snooze, however, the size is what makes it comfortable.  At night I can roll over without having to relocate anything but myself.  Since it wraps around, it mostly prevents accidentally sleeping on my stomach or back which could be harmful to baby and it's substantive without being too big to be cuddly as the person inside it.  This pillow is amazing and I'd highly recommend it if sleeping on your side doesn't come naturally to you.",5
Kiddopotamus Tiny Diner &amp; Bibbity 2-Pack Gift Set - Pink,"Great products, really good deal.  We used our previous placemat about 100 times with our older child.  Can be used anywhere.",5
Fisher Price Magical Sound N Lights Mirror,"I had no problem installing this mirror and it works great for me to keep an eye on my baby when driving.  The light show and music are nice but the music is too low even at the highest setting which makes ita problem when it get noisy on the road, other than that its a good product and it attaches safely to the head rest.",4
Trendsport Lite Stroller,"I thought this was an excellent stroller with the looks, storage space, lightness and other features UNTIL it folded on me.  My daughter is 21 months and 25lb, not a heavy load.  She got her finger stuck in between the bars and the skin got sheared off the tip.  This stroller folded on me a total of 4 times in 1 month before she got injured and I returned it. Be especially careful over curbs, train tracks or any type of a bump in the sidewalk.",1

Its best to spend the extra bucks on the actual models tubes and not this.,2
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,"I was in an accident this morning in which I hit a tree with the side of my van and then spun 270 degrees.  My toddler son, who was rear-facing in this seat, wasn't even shaken - though I think the van is totaled.  I will be ordering the exact same thing to replace that seat, now that it's been in an accident.",5
"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors May Vary","The small separate container works great, the tops require some effort to pry off but that works well against spillage.However the larger container where it works very easily to just pour one serving into a bottle, when the container bounced around a bit in my bag, it ended up mixing up all of the formula and I had to re-measure it which defeats the purpose. If you can keep it upright all the time it's fine but when trying to measure precisely and have it stay that way, this doesn't work 100%",2
Philips Avent Manual Comfort Breast Pump,"This pump didn't make good suction for me. The most I got out of it was 20ml. Also, after about a week it started making loud squeaking noises. The only good thing I got out of it was the bottle. I wish I would have returned the pump but I didn't.",1
"Evenflo Discovery 5 Infant Car Seat, Confetti Aruba","Just bought this car seat a few weeks ago for our daughter who came home from the hospital almost a month after she was born due to a heart condition that required her to have open heart surgery at a week old. As far as car seats go, this one is amazing. Not only is it adorable, durable and easy to hold, but it makes me feel so much better to have her in a car seat that doesn't jostle her when we are walking or driving thanks to all the padding and sturdy design. For a delicate baby like ours, or any baby for that matter, this is perfect.",5
Baby Trend Triplet Stroller in Navy,"I'm expecting twins in January 2005 and my daughter will be 17 months old upon their arrival. I'm looking for a good triple stroller that won't break the bank. Preferably something that will fit into my car, is easy to operate, and has a car seat that can attach into as a travel system !Please write to me .... gia.annecca@nextel.comThanks !",1
The First Years Compass Premier Folding Booster Car Seat in Daisy,"This is the best car seat! It's slight tilt helps my daughters head not fall forward when she falls asleep in the car, and the side head rest are big enough for her to rest. It's adjustable to grow with her. AND most improtantly i feel that she is safe in it. The pattern and colors are great.",5
Safety 1st Prograde No Drill Top Of Door Lock,"I agree with the other positive reviews: including, installs and removes in seconds. For a trip to ""Grandma's house"", I took them off our doors and then popped them on the doors at my mom's place. Quickly childproofing the rooms our toddler shouldn't enter.The only con is the relatively high price compared to other childproofing methods. But it's so sturdy it looks like I can resell it when we're done.",5
Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,Our 3 month old had been going through an awful sleep regression for about two weeks straight and I was getting desperate.  He goes to bed at 8:00pm and used to sleep in his own crib til around 4:00-4:30am.  Then for two weeks he was up around midnight and in bed with us at that point every night.  His first night in the sleepsuit he slept from 8:00pm to 7:30am in his crib without making a peep!  Second night he slept from 8:00pm to 7:00am and we are entering our third night right now. It has helped lengthen out his naps as well. It really helps muffle his reflexes and is comfortable so he feels like he is in bed with us!  I NEEDED my bed back and my sleep back and this is our saving grace!,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Toddler Bed, Pink",It folds up just like a lawn chair and has a carrying bag very light in weight. I have it in my office in case i have one of my daughters sick for the day. she states it is comfy.,5
"Boon Orb Bottle Warmer,Green","Easy to use and heats the bottle quickly. We were given another warmer and the milk is not as wrm and is takes longer and is a much bigger warmer. My only concern is, that on the small 4oz bottles the hot steam gets under the cap. Even after drying the bottle is hot for the little fingers that want to hold on. No problems with the larger bottles. Love the compact size.",4
"Aden by aden + anais 2 Pack Muslin Security Blanket, Safari Friends - Giraffe",My son loves these!  I like that they hold up wash after wash!,5
"Disney Umbrella Stroller with Canopy, Sweet Silhouettes","I am a grandma, new one, and this stroller is light and easy for me to pick up, fold up and store it. It appears to be well built and the designed fabric is adorable.  Great for quick trips, shopping, etc.",5
"Kissa's One Size Wet Diaper Bag, Mocca Swirl","I have really enjoyed our wetbag.  While at first I was concerned that it would be too small, it has actually been the perfect size for our day outings when we are running errands etc.  I would say that we have been able to fit about four of our fitted diapers into it no problem.  I love that it fits easily into our diaper bag without taking up too much room, it keeps the smell contained, and the cute prints are a plus.  I also think this wetbag has held up better than any other ones I have owned and it is very reasonably priced.",5
"The Safe Sippy 2 2-in-1 Sippy to Straw Bottle, Blue","After spending a lot of money replacing chewed up or non-spill proof spill proof cups, this cup was a God send. Well worth the money.",5
Munchkin 'White Hot' Duck Bath Toy,"It stays upright and clean, but once the thermometer chages to hot a few times, it permanantly stays there. The idea is great, but the function needs work.",3
Marinoff Low Vision Playing Cards,My 87 yr old Mom is a hit at her card parties - everyone wants to use her low vision cards.,5
"Summer Infant Bibbity, Pink",This seemed like a good idea but if you keep it rolled up it is hard to unroll. It flips back up when you put it on you baby. And the bottom cup does not stay open all the way so it defeats the purpose of catching all the extra food. I never actually used it much. I preferred a thinner fabric one that would mold better to the babies chest and could be thrown in the wash.,3
Moses Basket Set of 2 Sheets - color pink,"These are nice sheets for my trend labs Moses basket. They fit 29&#34; by 11&#34;. The only downside is the coloring. They are barely pink at all, it looks more like someone threw in something pink with the whites when washing :) The quality is good and they hold up in the washing machine well. They also fit nicely on the pad without being to tight or to loose.",4
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"I love this stroller. It is tall enough for me to push comfortably and I don't kick the back wheels. The basket is hard to access when the seat is reclined, but that's not very often. It has a cup holder and zippered pouch to keep my keys, phone, wallet, etc. The wheels turn smoothly and I don't have any issues like I did with the $15 Walmart special.",5
"J.L. Childress Side Sling Stroller Cargo Net, Black","This mesh bag is great. Fits different brands and styles of strollers. Very easy to install. I liked it so much, I bought a second one!",5
"Bunnies by the Bay My &quot;Furst&quot; Purse, Bunny","I got these for an Easter present and they are more like big coin purses than a regular purse, but they are soft. they are overpriced for the amount of product......  I was pretty disappointed for the cost.",2
"Kathe Kruse Stuffed Grabbing Toy, Giraffe","My youngest LOVES this, he cannot go to bed without it.  It has stained a bit after lots of teething done on it's poor ears and head.  Overall though it stands up to everything!  He carries it around by the neck.  Worth the money!",4
"Baby K'tan Breeze Baby Carrier, White, Large","This is a very nice wrap style carrier. The only downfall is it takes quite a bit of practice to get it right. I suggest looking up baby K'tan on youtube, they have some videos of the different holds.",4
Nook LilyPad Playmat (Poppy - Bright Orange),"This is thick and soft and looks nice in my living room because it doesn't scream &#34;baby.&#34;  I throw it into the washing machine and it's held up well.  I've been using it for a year, and I'm still very happy with it.",5
"Regalo Extra Wide 58 Inch WideSpan Walk Through Safety Gate, White","Our 20 lb dog knocks it over. Hard to get a grip on smooth wall surfaces. Also, it falls into several pieces when it comes down, kind of annoying. Overall it does the job but if you have a bigger dog you at have a hard time keeping him contained if he jumps up on the gate.",3
[Award Winning] Kidsme Food Feeder (Large size),"I used the Kidsme Food Feeder to give our niece peeled and mashed grapes. She chewed on it immediately til it was down to a small amount.  The large size fit in her mouth (10 mos old) but I sent for the replacement small size (2 per pack) because it&#699;s an easier fit at this point.You have to shake it a couple times when there&#699;s not much left because chewing/sucking on it pushes the remaining food up into the neck. I also rough puree then free pear, watermelon, cantelope etc. then break it up and put it into the feeder.  She likes it- gets a little messy but not like handing her a fruit pop.  But it&#699;s easy to clean and the silicone is nice and soft but strong.  Shape works but you can&#699;t fill it too full or it won&#699;t close.",5
"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss Mobile, ABC","Very cute, perfect over crib.",4
"JL Childress Gate Check Bag for Umbrella Strollers, Red","This worked great to store the bassinet from our stroller and gate check it. The bassinet is super light. However, after only 1 use there was a tear in it. They are inexpensive enough that I will buy another one...$11 is nothing in order to ensure that our $200 bassinet stays safe at gate check.",4
"Dr. Brown's Breastmilk Collection Bottles, 4 Pack","these are great. I have a the playtex embrace double pump and these fit perfectly. These are also a lot cheaper than the playtex bottles. They are lined up to 3 ozs but you can fit 4 ozs of milk in them. They have a solid, one piece lid so there is no chance of leaking. They took longer than I expected to arrive but they work so well that I still give them the 5 stars.",5
"Mini Orchestra, Set of 4",Best toy we have bought. Loves to make music and it exactly the same as the set that is sold by gymboree.,5
"Harmony Kids Round Back Glider, Blue Chenille","At first, I was skeptical to order because of the price compared to other&#8217;s online.  However, I was not disappointed when we received it.  It&#8217;s perfect for the nursery&#8230;..even though its ivory, it still matches the room (white furniture).  Material is super soft and comfortable, gotta love washable slipcovers.  I have no issues with the back height or any noise/squeak when rocking or swiveling.  Can&#8217;t wait to rock baby girl to sleep in this.",5
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","I have 2 of these large bags, and keep them in rotation. I cloth diaper my twins, and wash about every other day. There is never any stink and nothing leaks through the bag.  It's easy to just toss right in the washing machine along with the diapers. It holds 12-14 soiled diapers easily.When washing, just be sure to turn the bag fully inside out.  I didn't a couple of times, and, well I guess it continued to do it's jon right there in the washer because when I took it out, it was actually full of water.  So, pull the liner fully out and it will be smooth sailing.",5
The First Years Newborn to Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat,"THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BESTS PURCHASES OF MY LIFE!First of all you will love this soooo stable and secure base!I have twins, i can move and place the chairs SO SAFELY in practically ANY SURFACE AT MY HOME!it makes me so easy to feed them! because I put them on the top of my dinning table and I can feed them on my feet (for me it is very uncomfortable to feed them sitting down!)both babies are comfortable!!!! they love their chair!!!and also the cover is soooooo wash machine safe! and they look perfect! as new before washing them!I REALLY RECOMMEND THIS MODEL (Because the new one does not has a soooo secure base)",5
"American Baby Company Teddy Bear Terry Cradle Set, Ecru",This is a beautiful cradle set!! Very satisfied with the thickness and the look of the comforter. Could not be happier!,5
DadGear The Classic Messenger Diaper Bag - Coal Black,"Simple, sturdy, slim to carry, not too much pockets where you forget where you put stuff, should last longer then 2.5 years, shoulder strap is firm with shoulder pad just at the right space, grab handles are subtle what it turns out it's better that way so won't easily tangle with stuff around, light color wall inside is easy to see, the wipe dispenser is easy/quick to get to, water resistence, can stand up on it's own when you have stuff insideAreas for improvements: find way to shorten or store the left-over strap which can be a bit annoying, find ways to dampen the metal-clicking sound from all the little zippers",5
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,"My son loves to play ""dino world"" just about every day!! The tub is great for storing the set & theres plenty of room for more things.  We keep a bunch of blocks and small cars in there to add tothe scene and creative play.  The mat it comes with is kind of a joke , lasting maybe one day.  But that's no reason to not buy this.Like others, we purchased thise elsewhere for MUCH less than the 60-something Amazon is currently selling it.",5
Medela Nursing Stool,"I nursed our son for about 7 weeks without this, like many mothers, slouching and what not was killing my already injured back, a friend of mine had one and i tried it...loved it! Ordered one for myself and cant do without. Even ordered an addiotional one for my grandparents house that we are going to in the next week in another state! Highly recommend and I will definantly be using this for our other babies to come!Thanks Medela for once again, making an outstanding product...also...If anyone is having problems with there child- reguardless of age-- lactching on or nipple soreness or whatever......I recommend the medela nipple shield, I used it for latch on problems and immediately my son nurses just fine, its for temporary use but I have been using it non stop sense my son was born..keeps me from being sore! You can buy it at Target or anywhere Medela products are sold.I own the pump in style advanced... get this one, its worth every penny!",5
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue),"I purchased this when I was still pregnant. My 10 week old has a cold and this is the first time I've had to use it. I much prefer it over the standard bulb! I was always scared that with the standard bulb he would move and I would accidentally jam it up his nose. He still fusses, but this is much faster so he doesn't have to fuss for as long, much easier to clean, and safer for him!***update** Now that my baby is older, 16 months, I find that the length of the tube may be a little too long. Since it's harder for him to sit still while I do it, it's so long that it can twist and curl up, which makes it hard to use. But I still prefer it over the bulb! I did bring it down a star because I purchased the Nosefrida and prefer that over BabyComfyNose now.",4
Tadpoles Three Bulb Chandelier in Lavender Topaz,"We got this for our 7 year old granddaughter.  She loves it.  The first time she saw it she said, &#34;I'm speechless!&#34;",5
"Best Bottom Stay Dry Inserts, Large, 3 Count","I've used a variety of cloth covers and inserts.  These are my favorites by far!  Let me start by saying this system is so easy and convenient.  The inserts snap in so you can have diapers ready as easy as pockets without the extra work.  And are daddy and sitter friendly!  They are super absorbent but without the smell factor that always comes with microfiber.  Thick layers, but still give a trim fit.  I'm buying more.  I wish I had tried these first.  I've got a bunch of pocket covers I won't use anymore, and a good amount of inserts that just don't perform as well.  We are using the medium sized right now, and they are absorbent enough for overnight.  That may change as he grows though.  The best absorbency I can compare these to are Thirsties hemp prefolds, which come second only because I have to fold them.  I'm a fan of the snap in ease of these.  Even if they aren't snapped in, they still work amazing in other covers.  But Best Bottoms are my fav covers too.  Trim and I love that I don't have to swap out a new cover with every change, they keep my baby dry (not in wet leaked on clothes all the time) and wash up great.",5
"Kidkusion Gummi Grip Shopping Cart Handle Cover, Green","My husband is a self-proclaimed germophobe and always hated that the grocery store was out of disinfectant wipes for the buggies. I bought him this as a gift, and he now keeps it in his car. He does not like going shopping without it - we use it all the time. We always get questions about what it is, and when we tell people they think it is ingenious and ask where we got it. It is very easy to use, comfy, and alleviates our worries about germs.",5
Lansinoh mOmma Straw Cup Replacement Straws,I really like being able to get there. The bottle was my sons favorite however chewing is a problem but it is a problem with all of the bottles with soft straws... he already torn up every bottle with a soft straw.

Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,"Super easy to use.  Just drop in a pre-made bottle from the fridge, and hit the button to warm.  Great product!",5
"Safety 1st Space Saver Infant Tub, Blue",This is a safe beautifull firts bath tub for a baby. The packaging perfect and delivered on time. I am very happy with this purchase.,5
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Activity Gym,"As soon as my daughter was interested in toys, this became her favorite place to be! She loves batting and kicking the different animals.  It's pretty expensive for what it is (thank you mother-in-law!), but baby girl can lie on the mat for 20-30 minutes and will play by herself, and I haven't found anything else that will entertain her for that long. The Skip Hop products are generally more attractive than other kids' brands and this was no exception. There are rattles and crinkle noises, but nothing too gaudy, and the tree theme is charming.",5
"NUK Hello Kitty Silicone Spout Learner Cup, 5 Ounce","Cup is easy for her to hold and drink out of, but very resistant to spilling. Other cups have been too difficult to drink or to easy to spill - this one is a good balance of both.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"I hardly ever right reviews but feel the jumperoo is very over rated and not accurately reviewed. I have a five month old son and research every product for him almost excessively, and going by all the stellar reviews from multiple sources, I thought it would be great.  We have had the FP rainforest jumperoo for two months and he does not  play in it for longer than fifteen minutes and really is bored after ten. He enjoys his Tiny Love play mat more than his jumperoo. The basics of the jumperoo toys are 3 spin toys- a little redundant-they all do the same thing, the peek a boo tiger does not work properly it barely lifts up enough and there is an elephant that is supposed to be pushed around - but it snaps back with force - could be a safety hazard. I should have gone with an evenflo stationary play station which has a better variety of of toys baby can engage with.",2
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"I was told that the brown bulb suctions from the hospital were the best suctions out there....wrong! My sister, a nurse, introduced me to the nosefrida. &#34;It's the best thing ever&#34;, she said. So after our 2nd respirtory infection and many mattress raised, humidified nights without relief I took the plunge and bought the frida. Needless, to say we have never looked back! Also it is more hygenic. You can actually clean all the parts. I have heard horror stories of what the inside of those bulb suctions look like when cut open even after being &#34;cleaned&#34;. Bye Bye brown bulb suction...Hello Nosefrida!",5
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White",Perfect way to have a safer situation so children cannot pull out the pieces of outlet plugs and choke on them.,5
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"Baby doesn't like this feedback around her, she won't allow it. Great quality though. Very impressed with the quality of this item",1
"Britax Monarch Booster Car Seat, Royal Racer","It is everything I was hoping it would be.  Very easy to assemble, only the top portion and the base, lightweight and cozy.  As in previous reviews the cupholders are pretty useless, but I wasn't looking for cupholder usability when I was shopping for a car safety seat for my daughter.I would highly recommend this product.",5

Munchkin Caterpillar Spillers Stacking Cups,My son loves bathtime thanks to these stacking cups which keep him happily occupied.  He even plays with them out of the bath.  We plan on taking them along to the beach during his first trip there in a couple of months.,4
"Infantino Balance Baby Carrier, Spindles, 8-35 Pounds","This is a fine carrier for the price at around 2/3 the cost of a Bjorn, but there are a number of difficult aspects that make it inferior.  Just spring for the Bjorn.This product is advertised as being able to put it on yourself, but it's necessarily a two-man job both to put it on and to remove it.  Once it's on, however, it's quite stable if a little tight.If you've ever used a Bjorn, you'd probably chuckle watching someone try to strap the Infantino on.  A Bjorn is elegant.  You put on the shoulder straps and then attach the carrier to them.  With the Infantino, it's awkward.  You put on one shoulder, clip the waistband around your back, slide the baby in, put on the other shoulder and then attempt to attach the side clips.  There's also another clip on the back at your shoulder blades that locks the shoulder straps in place.  My wife and I could not do it by ourselves -- with or without balancing a baby at the same time.  You have to be in the circus to perform those maneuvers by yourself.I seriously question whether the Infantino could comfortably support a 35 lb baby.  Sure, the thing ain't going to fail on you and drop your kid to the ground, but our 8 lb babies are already pressed fairly tight to our chests and there's not much adjusting room left.Other elements that make it inferior to a Bjorn are the fact that you can't place your baby facing forward and the fact that your baby must straddle your stomach (where as the legs hang down in a Bjorn), which must lead to some hip stress for the child.Overall this is a very average carrier that should definitely cost under $35.",3
"Kolcraft Cuddle 'N Care 2-in-1 Bassinet and Incline Sleeper, Emerson",Not very pleasing to look at but does the job. The stars that hang on top are too high for newborn to see. The music is ok except for the singing. Its kind of freaky. I never use the light or vibration feature. Also I dont use the inclince because I feel its too soft and puts baby into a very awkward position. Its a pain to switch from rocking bottom to wheels because you have to get the floor and do each wheel one by one which isn't a problem but it isn't sobering you can do quickly while baby is lying in it.. Overall just ok...,3
Naturepedic Non Waterproof Airflow Mattress Topper Crib Flat,"I didn't get this for the air flow reasons, but moreso because I thought the naturepedic mattress I have felt really hard.  I wanted some type of soft mattress topper and nontoxic.  This is pricey, but I think it makes the mattress much more comfortable for my son.",5
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue),it should be a bit smaller so it can go inside the nose .It is really hard to get the stuff out of baby's nose. I think it is a waste of money.,2
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","I first bought a miracle blanket to use when my son came home from the NICU.  As a family physician, I'd read the evidence that swaddling comforts/calms babies and after all he'd been through as a preemie, I wanted to make him as comfortable as possible.  We used the Miracle Blanket every day, mostly in the evenings when he seemed to be more fussy than usual.  After a couple of weeks, he would just see the blanket and you could see his little brain think, ""Aaaaahhhh!"".  We used it during feeding and swaddled him before we put him in his crib in it to sleep at night and at nighttime.  I loved the fact that is is soft and very long (for wrapping the baby like a burrito).  The arm flaps took a bit of practice, but within no time, I was able to coordinate putting them over his arms and the ends of the flaps under his back in one fluid motion.  Four years later, after my daughter was born, someone gave us a swaddling blanket with velcro.  I tried it for her but even at two weeks old she was able to break her arms out of it.  I brought out the Miracle Blanket again and used it until she was 3-4 months old.  Now, I give the Miracle Blanket to all my friends and families who are expecting new babies.  As I tell them, it really is a ""miracle."" I recommend you look at YouTube for several good videos showing how to put the baby in the blanket.",5
Summer Infant Complete Nursery Care Kit Girl,"Brush, comb, nail clippers, teether, emery boards, finger toothbrush, gum massager are all great and useful items.Aspirator doesn't work well at all. It has yet to suck in a booger. I ended up just using the one we got from the hospital.The cap on the pacifier medicine dispenser won't close once you open it.The bag isn't as useful as everything gets mixed up. They don't stay in their ""compartments"".FINAL VERDICT: Worthy urchase, but may find it cheaper in stores. I wanted it in pink but now that she's here, I don't even care about the colour.",3
"Carter's Easy Fit Printed Crib Fitted Sheet, Animal","I like the pattern.  It's durable, and the color is pretty.  Just the material is a little bit hard.  After washing several times, it's still not very soft.",4

Safety 1st ProGrade 4 Latches No Drill Magnetic Cabinet and Drawer Latches,"We installed these locks on a couple cabinets in our kitchen.  One lock is not currently working, but I think it was an installation error.  My husband just needs to place it a little higher on the door.  These are great and keep our daughter from chemicals and other dangerous things under the sink.",4
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Adorable Sleepsack, cute as a button and very well made. I would recommend this product. Makes a great baby shower gift for mommy to be.",5
"The First Years Soothie Newborn Pacifiers, Boy","The hospital where was son was born uses these pacifiers. At first I was worried about nipple confusion and concerned that the hospital gave him a pacifier without asking me. Using the Soothie pacifiers he has had no problem with nipple confusion.He LOVES these things. We were given several different types of pacifiers as gifts at my shower and when we got home we gave them to him. He spit every one of them out immediately. The only pacifier he would use was this pacifier.It's shaped the same as a nipple from a bottle and I think that shape is much easier for him to suck on.Like I said, I was initially worried about nipple confusion, but there are some times when he just wants to suck, but isn't hungry. Without the Soothie pacifiers we wouldn't have anything to satisfy that.",5
"Stephen Joseph Bath Toy Caddy, Owl",Great Item for the bath fits lots of toys and very cute. Great owl water bath gift. Bright colors. Thanks,5
"GracoTravel Lite Crib With Stages, Notting Hill","This mini pack and play is perfect to keep in our bedroom for our new baby to sleep in. It's just the right size for traveling as well. I can easily take this on vacation and to the Grandparent's home if needed. My baby sleep comfortably in it at night, since she is not ready for her actual crib in her own room yet. It's very easy to open and close. I had no problems putting it together myself either (without my husband's help)  :)",5
Buggy Bagg Shopping Cart Cover - Black Toile,"For the big zipper to break within the first month of use was a pretty big disapointment.  However, is it very well padded and fits shopping charts at Costco.",3

Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,"Having nursed my daughter over the past year, the Bebe Au Lait nursing cover has been an indispensable accessory that has seen perhaps the most use of any baby item we've purchased. It's a must for nursing in public except for those that are a bit more daring about their level of public breast exposure. The built-in pockets are wonderful for storing small accessories, such as the nipple shields I needed. They have also doubled as impromptu burp rags for quick, small clean-up jobs. The wire sewn into the neckline creates a convenient and discrete way to peek in on the baby as they nurse, which is rather critical when trying to get them comfortably situated and properly latched on. As a whole, the cover folds up compactly for convenient transport via diaper bag (or purse). The one challenge we encountered is that, as my daughter grew older and more active, she grew fond of waving the cover around like a flag, which sort of defeats the purpose. By the ten month mark, she no longer tolerated being hidden under the cover since it blocked her view of what was going on around her. The cover still gets five stars for being a critical part of our nursing relationship for a solid ten months. Just be aware that older babies may be less tolerant of it.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"This has been a life saver.  My newborn wouldn't sleep and this made it happen.  The vibration made sleeping better for her and eased her colic.  Now that she is a few months old and sleeps in her crib with no problem, the removable toys are back on the seat and keep her entertained while I'm cooking or showering.  I would recommend this to anyone.",5
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant","This is my 3 rd bundleme.  I love these they are stylish, warm and cozy.  I love this.color because it matches my stroller.",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",This carseat is perfect!!! My 21 month old loves it!  He is able to sit more upright yet when he falls asleep his head doesn't fall forward like it does in his Evenflow.Setup is much easier than his Evenflow and it doesn't take up as much space in the seat.The clips are a little hard to unbuckle but I think this is just because it is brand new and 0 degrees outside.,5
Chewy Tubes Knobby Super Chew Red,It's a terrible product. The tube broke and split into two in a few days of use by my son on the spectrum.There are better products out there.,1
2 Red Hens Celebration Collection Bib Set-Ornaments And Swirls,I bought these for a friend with twin boys and I am really disappointed.  I think they are on sale because the neck hole is not adjustable and is very small.  It would only fit a baby with a tiny neck.  Very disappointed.,1
Wubbanub Infant Pacifiers (Pink Kitty),"My son loved his baby Dino Wubbanub. We had just lost his giraffe and I thought this one was cute. It came in and he loved it.it used to be his partner in crime and before he had most of his teeth, were very durable. We had machine washed it a couple of times, because he did toss it a few times. Unfortunately, he ended up chewing a hole into it and now he no longer wants to use it. But he's 13 months and getting over the pacifier stage, so we're ok with that.",5
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White","I  very happy that I purchased these for all the outlets in our home. They fit perfectly on all our outlets and don't even look that bad. I also haven't had any issues with plugging in items. They take a little work to open which is exactly what I want to prevent my daughter from accessing the outlet. What I love the most is not having to deal with the individual outlet covers--pulling them out to use the outlet, putting them in a place where my daughter can't reach them and then remembering to plug them back in. Additionally, if my daughter pulls out a cord that's plugged in, the covers automatically slide shut. In my opinion, they are definitely the best option for child proofing outlets.",5
Medela Personal Fit XX Large Breastsheilds 36mm - Medela 87084,"Unfortunately I had to return these.  They were WAY too big AND they were only part of what I needed.  As soon as the product arrived, I could see from the side of the box, how to determine the proper size for a breast shield.  I instantly knew I bought the wrong size.  Why wasn't that information posted in a conspicuous place in the description?  If it had been, I would have bought the small size.Additionally, I did not realize that this piece of breast shield was only one part.  I needed the other section too!",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Sophie is well worth the money! Our 6 month old son LOVES it. It is the only teether that he is able to hold firmly and put any part of it in his mouth. The squeaker is slightly annoying, but tolerable. The surface is a bit tacky and helps him hold onto it better than most toys (and not drop it as esaily in restaurants, etc).",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Our grandson loves to turn it on at night and go to sleep while it is on. Gives a tranquil feeling.,5
"LA Baby 3&quot; Compact Crib Mattress, White","I bought this mattress for my grandson's Pack n Play at my home.  After searching everywhere, I decided to try this mattress. It fits perfect. Granted it doesn't fold up, but I also never move his weekend bed.  He has slept so much better since I purchased this product.",5
Bummis Super Whisper Wrap Diaper Cover: Medium (15-30lbs),We've tried just about every diaper cover out there as well as every AIO and we keep coming back to the Bummis super whisper. Our daughter is thin and tall and the velcro means we're able to get the diaper tightened to fit perfectly. Well worth the money.,5
Olive N Figs Quilted Diaper Bag with Changing Pad - Midnight Daisies,Big big and lots and lots of pockets and this is the same model as vera bradley bags but this one is in one pattern only but olive in figs sell this one and it is the same bag wow i cant believe how much i saved cause this is the same bag on vera bradley website is 95.00 dollars TRUST ME every part of this bag is the same as the vera bradely bag,5
Ring Snuggies ~ Ring Sizer / Assorted Sizes Adjuster Set of Six Per Pack,Perfect for what I needed. They come in a variety of lengths and sizes so that I could find the perfect one I needed for my engagement ring.,5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo,"My son just loves this thing.  It is a little tall so you have to wait a little longer to start using it, but at just 3 months my son loved to stand and jump so much, I starting putting him in this and just holding on to him, putting pillows under his feet so he could touch.  At 4 months old, this is his favorite spot to be.  He screams and laughs, jumps, jumps and jumps!  He loves the sounds and the lights, and gets super excited as soon as we start to put him in it.  There are lots of activities for him to do and lots of things to touch.  It is hard to turn, but he's not at that stage yet anyways.  Thanks for the awesome Jumperoo!  It's the only way I get things done when hes hyper!",5

Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,This carrier seems to be a great idea and does provide you with hands free carrying of your baby and that in itself is a god sent.  I have problems getting my baby in and out of it.  The snaps or clips that are on the side of seat part are a pain to get on or off.  I can never get them on or off without a struggle and often end up just giving up and loading baby from the top and pulling him out when were done using it.  Overall its a great idea but those clips need some work or a better design would be great.  Overall its a great carrier and doesnt put a whole lot of strain on my back and its fairly easy to slip on and off if you leave some of the straps fastened all the time.  I am petite 5'1 and dont have any height issues with it at all.,3
"NUK Active Silicone Spout Learning Cup, Ladybug, 10-Ounce","Well we had already used this cup for our daughter and she took to it very well. We decided to try it for our son as well and he also took to it with no problem. Awsome cup to move off of the bottle from. As far as the shipping, I paid for 2 day and received it the next day!",5
"Disney Pixar Toy Story 3 Step Stool, Blue","This is a step, works as a step therefore it's a good product.  It has little rubber feet to keep it from sliding about and the top is nice and wide. Kids love it.",5
5 x 2 Way Dotting Marbleizing Pen Set with Free Bonus &quot;Hello Kitty&quot; Gold Nail Art Decoration and Rhinestones,I gave this product 4 stars because the Hello Kitty decals were so microscopicslly tiny that they look like diamonds...you can't tell that they are hello kitty at all. They are solid instead of the outline which was advertised but being that they were a bonus with the dotters I can't say too much. I love the dotters...the design is beautiful and they make a great addition to my nail products. Fast delivery! Thanks.,4
"The First Years Spinning Drying Rack, White",I bought about 5 of these this yr so I would have something on hand for Baby showers I have/will attend.  They are not carried in any of the stores where I am so the Soon-toBe Moms love it& knows that I took the time out to get them someone that they will definitely use for their babies.,5
The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier,"I tried every brand of clippers you can imagine and these are the best. They have a small head so sometimes you have to clip twice on each nail but they are more precise, require almost no effort when cutting nail so it's easier to gauge if you accidentally are about to clip skin. This should be the only brand allowed to make baby nail clippers. Also, magnifier pops right off if you prefer not to use it like me.",5
"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","This is the perfect pet gate.  I have two Golden Retrievers and numerous cats that I don't want running upstairs at certain times.  I looked for gates but nothing was attractive enough, tall enough and easy to install.  This gate filled all of those categories and more.  The cat's can't get through, the dogs can't jump over and the gate handily closes as you pass through. I bought black so it blends in, although a pet or child gate can only be so attractive, this one is in the acceptable range.  It was easy to install, I mounted the cups with a single screw and the gate fastened securely.  Although it came with numerous, unattractive warning labels they were easily removed after applying the heat of a hair dryer.  I would highly recommend this product for pets and I am sure it would work equally well for children as well.",5
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue",After purchasing this product I am thoroughly convinced that every child should have one! I bought this for my five month old daughter. Since she is so small we did have to place something under her feet at first because she could not touch the floor even on the lowest setting. The batteries last forever and I love the extra loops for adding your own toys as well. Alexia is now seven months and rarely if ever gets tired of this entertainer. A must have for any mommy!!,5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Works great on my round glass table.  I wish my son wouldn't find the edge and lift it up, but other than that, it works great.",5
"Miyim Simply Organic Lovie Blankie, Monkey, 0-3 Months","This is the perfect size for a baby's hands. I bought this lovey as opposed to other products because I wanted something organic (since you know it goes right in baby's mouth!). Cute monkey, and thick enough material that it seems very durable. (Note: this is a lovey not a blanket; if you are looking for a full-sized blanket this is not the product you want.)",5
DaVinci Sleepwell Willow Natural Coconut Palm Crib Mattress,I absolutely love this mattress. I purchased one about three years ago for my daughter and I just purchased another for my son who was just born as well. I love that one side is infant and the other side is toddler. My daughter slept very well on this mattress on both sides. Great quality. I have no doubt my son will sleep just as well.,5
Fisher-Price Deluxe Quick-Clean Portable Booster,"I bought this for occasional use for when the grands roll into town. The price is low, no bells, no whistles and that part is o.k.  The part that I don't like is that it is very small, very cheaply made, almost to the point of being disposable.  We just used it for the first time and hope it makes it through the week!  Next time, which I was hoping wouldn't be, I will buy something bigger, something better, something lasting and be willing to pay more.  I like a good deal, who doesn't? This was a total waste of money.",2
Philips AVENT Newborn Starter Set,I never had any problems with the 4oz bottles but my daughter has been using the 9oz bottles for some time now and they worked great at first but after a while they begin to leak at times and I have to screw and unscrew the nipple on sometimes 5 or 6 times to get them to stop leaking milk all down the side of the bottle. I am having another baby and looking into new different bottles this time.,2
"The First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce","I've been exclusively breastfeeding my son but figured it would be good to introduce a bottle so that my husband or others could feed him (son is 4 mo old). I've tried Medela, Avent, Dr. Browns 1 and premie, Tommee Tippee and now Breastflow. All but the Tommee Tippee and Breastflow were way too fast for my son and he would choke then not want to take the bottle any more. Tommee Tippee was decent- he would take it but try to push it out a lot and only eat a fraction of milk. We decided to try Breastflow and he took to it right away. The flow is perfect for him and he can control how much he gets once the 2nd chamber is filled. I think this is the best bottle out there that is most like the breast. I did have it leak on me once out of the 8 times we have fed our son with it. I love how the bottle is nice and wide- less chance to fall over if knocked, and the top can attach to the bottom of the bottle to keep it from getting lost or dirty. The bottle is easy to clean and there are only 5 parts to it (including the lid).",5
Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Wipes Refill 350ct.,"If you like the idea of a more healthy wipe for your kid, please do yourself a favor and buy some Babyganics Thick & Kleen. They are way better than these small, thin, smelly wipes. I can even use the Babyganics on my kids' crusty noses, and I wouldn't think of putting these wipes near my kids' faces.",2
K's Kids Learning Shoe,"I thought this would help my granddaughter with learning about buttons, zippers,etc. However the button hole is not large enough to really fit the button and frustrate all  of us toddler and parents. I am not as happy as I could be with this toy.",2
One Step Ahead - Car Seat Protector for Upholstery,"I bought this to protect a light beige leather interior.  The protector fit reasonably well, and the pouches at the bottom of the protector were nice to store toys in.  I removed the protector after about 5 days of having it in because I was moving the car seat to another car.  When the protector was removed the black dye used on the non-slip base of the protector had transferred to my beige leather seats. Ironically the seat protector had done more damage to the interior than anything that it protected against would have done.  Tried several different leather cleaners and the stains will not go away.  I will most likely have to have the leather re dyed. There were no problems with the interior prior to using this product; it is a late model car and the leather interior is regularly conditioned.In any case if you are planning on using this to protect leather interiors, this is not the product for you.",1
"Boon Lawn Countertop Drying Rack, Green","We just had our first baby and were putting bottles on paper towels on the counter to dry. It was unsightly and probably not too clean either. I looked for a better solution and came across this. I bought two which is perfect for the number of bottles we have (I'd recommend two). It looks great and functions perfectly. The grass is sturdy so you can hang stuff off the side blades if you want. I've been using them for a couple weeks now and very little water gets trapped underneath, meaning you won't have a bunch of stale water sitting around. I'd recommend this for any new (or not so new) mom.",5
"Angel Dear Cuddle Twin Set, Brown Puppy","This item is quite expensive for what you get. Looks cheap. Although soft. My child wasnt interested. I wouldnt recommend it,",3
"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","Overall a great stroller for moms and dads.  Very light and folds quickly and compact when you need to store it in house or in your car to be light footed to chase down your child as he runs screaming towards the ice cream truck.  The shade is the size of a small bus, VERY pragmatic!  It blocks out the sun like a astronomical eclipse as predicted by the Mayans.  Overall, I'd recommend this to any parent looking to unleash their parental duties by keeping the kids safe and happy in a confident stroller.",4
Flip: One-Size Snap Closure Diaper Cover - Blossom,"I've used these Flip covers for 4-5 months now and love that we switched from gDiapers to them. They do not require as much preparation as far as snap in liners etc. I did not purchase flip inserts to ""match"". We have been using the gDiaper cloth inserts with real Nappies diaper liners over top. My son is 14 mos an about 25-27lbs on the second snap. We use these in rotation with 5 other Flip covers. I just throw them in the wash pail when he has gone number two. Otherwise I wipe out the inside, hang to dry and use again. They wash great and I air dry them as suggested. I love te design of having a one size fits all and though there is slight pilling on the legs from wash and wear they have held up great. We plan to use for LO number two!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"I like that this play gym isn't &#34;over-bearing&#34; in color and LOUD and obnoxious.  My son LOVES the toys and I love how you can interchange them, remove them and bring them along.  It does not come with a pillow for tummy time like other gyms and the mirror is small..my MAIN PROBLEM is that the music that is supposedly supposed to play for 20 minutes shuts on and off.  It did at first, but after a couple of weeks, It happens sporadically, sometimes we have to keep going over to tap the top of it so it can start up again.  I thought I saw this complaint in another review but thought - what the heck, I'll give it a try.  Would I buy it again? Sure, because the price is reasonable, and like I said it's sweet.  I don't see any use in spending $100 on a play mat/gym. So if I have to put up with a little issue - no biggie...",3
Baby Einstein Count and Compose Piano,"the keys are kind of funny when baby presses them. They sometimes speak and other time not so much. I would say that this toy is interesting to an infant for about 3 or 4 weeks. So, if the price is worth that amount of time. Get it. It looks pretty and the ""demo"" batteries in the package should last that long.",3
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","The stroller is huge, but it has to be to accommodate 2 seats. It handles nicely, and could be steered with one hand if needed (not as easily as the b-agile, but still doable). The cupholder makes the stroller just a touch too wide and it's constantly bumping into things. I don't put anything with a straw in there bc the straw ends up touching all sorts of things if were in tight quarters (which is frequent with this big of a stroller). The quality is great, as all britax products are, and the black frame is sleek and I get so many compliments on it. I dont like that the handle bar is what touches the ground when you fold it.. kinda gross if you think about it.My biggest gripe would be with amazon honestly.. They were the distributor, and the first stroller I received was manufactured 16 months ago, the box had been opened, and the stroller was broken. So of course I requested a replacement. They sent me another one, but that one was also 16 months old, box opened, and stroller used. I again requested a replacement and when my third stroller arrived with a manufacture date of 16 months ago, box barely holding together.. I was so disappointed. I opened up the box and low and behold.... a used stroller. Quite frustrating! Amazon customer service swears the strollers are new and that I couldnt possibly be recieving used items, but unfortunately, that is not the case.  I had gone so long without a stroller and I decided to suck it up, and keep the third stroller despite my disappointment. Amazon is giving Britax a bad name if they keep selling used/returned/old products like they have been. I will definitely be recommending Britax in the future, however I will not be recommending Amazon when it comes to big/expensive purchases anymore.",4
"Manhattan Toy Wood Rattle, Ringble","Very cute with bright and engaging colors, but the way that the rattle is shaped leaves no place to hold/shake in little hands.  My daughter was very content to stare at it when she was little and watch other people shake it, but since it didnt have an area that she could easily grasp, it quickly fell to the bottom of our diaper bag.  Great idea, unfortunate design.",3
Baby Blocks Freezer Container Set Size: 4 oz.,It lets me store and frizz baby food with no problems. Easy to store and use. I wish it came with different colors,4
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Ran the Graco for the first time, went to fill the tank and since it was too large to use the sink faucet, put it under the tub faucet. It slipped, dropped a few inches into the tub and shattered. Very thin plastic, never had this problem with my old Holmes. Now that I've read all the bad reviews about the filter and I put in an Amex claim so I might get my money back on this one, I'm thinking to go for a more expensive one without a filter. This one is highly rated in all the consumer sites and none mention the stinky filter problem, but I do believe all the reviewers on this site!",2
"Kid'Sleep My First Alarm Clock, Pink",We returned it b/c the digital clock is way too small to read and my 3 year old can't tell time on the analogue clock so we needed the digital much bigger.,2
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"The Graco pack n play is great! So easy to set up  and very sturdy. I m so happy that I can move it from one room to another and it will go from a bassinet to a playpen without much effort. Love it, love it love it!!!!!",5
Thudguard Baby Safety Helmet - Blue,"The baby helmet fit my grandson perfectly. He is only starting to walk on his own. Purchased because I have really hard glazed tile It could have been a little thicker.Also he won't let it stay on and uses it as a toy. Generally an """"ok"""" purchase.",3
"SippiGrip - Universal Sippi Grip, That is compatible with all Type of Baby Bottle, Cup &amp; Baby Toys",Time to get my sowing skills back up to snuff.  The stitching around one of the velcro pieces is coming undone and this leaves the water bottle hanging by a thread when DS decides to cast it off his high chair.  I'm a little disappointed because we've only been using this for a few months.  I would've expected better craftsmanship.,3
"Graco Travel Lite Crib Sheet, Pink",firm believer in buying exactly what you need if anyone makes it. here it is. if you have the graco tavel lite crib this IS the sheet that was made to go with it. if you buy it you wont be disappointed. yes it is a simple sheet but its sewn and cut to fit perfectly. just saying.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"We bought this back in 2008 for our first child when I could no longer tolerate spending whole days with my baby on my hip. It was a lifesaver back then - I needed somewhere I could dump her while I hung up the washing or chopped an onion which would allow her to sit up a little, watch me and be jiggled about at the same time. The vibrations would soothe her while the horrible plastic toys and particularly the light-up waterfall would distract her and I would get approximately 20 mins to get stuff done before she lost interest and needed picking up again. It may not seem like much but that 20 minutes was GOLDEN. We're now on our third baby and once again it is proving to be a wonder tool. The bouncer is also occasionally wheeled out for visiting parents who are amazed by its capabilities to soothe and distract. Unlike other reviewers, I never found the music plastic toys (which, as other reviewers have pointed out, do hang to low down) the most compelling feature and neither did I much appreciate the garish jungle print, but the 'Vibrator' fast became one of a few absolute essentials I wouldn't not have done without. We actually left the 'bridge' attachment with its waterfall, monkey and parrot, off the chair for the second and third babies, preferring to place a toy arch in front of the chair and hang other toys off it.The only problem is that now, five years after we bought it and having seen us through three babies, the motor that makes it vibrate has worn out and it no longer jiggles. This is obviously a disappointment as it is for me the overwhelming clincher, but it is getting old and I would consider this lifespan for a small motor of this sort pretty average, good even. I'm hoping that I can find a Fisher Price spare parts supplier that will replace it for me.(N.B., if you're curious as to what else I rate as having that 'lifesaving' quality for coping with babies and toddlers, you could peek at my other reviews - yet to write but I plan to share my experiences)",5
"Solarsafe Stroller , Playard &amp; Pack 'n Play Net - 85% UV protection",love this solarsafe stroller net. my son likes it to he can see through the net. protects baby for son and the bugs.love it when we use it lots of people look at it and few moms even asked me where i got the net.,5
"Bottle Cooler Bag and Ice Packs for Breastmilk Storage. Can Fit Into Medela Pump-in-style Carry Bag, and Can Hold Upto 5 Lansinoh Breastmilk Storage Bags","This product would have been a great solution to storing my breastmilk while at work.  However, after only 2 days of usage, one of the freezer packs burst. I was able to replace it with a small frezzer pack I got at Target, but it is still disappointing that the product broke so soon.Otherwise, the pack works fine.  It keeps milk cool during extended hours (8 am - 5:45 pm in my case).  It holds the plastic storage bags well.",2

Dandelion Diapers Organic Cotton Blend Prefolds Dozen - Size 3,I bought these for my little guy as no overnight diaper was working.  I got sick of him waking up soaked and his changing his bedsheets daily.  I use these with an AIO diaper cover and put this pre-fold in the center of the cover along with a microfiber insert.  I have had good luck with this combination of the inserts.  I have a happier baby that is no longer wet in the morning along with a happy mother not constantly doing soiled bedsheets and soiled pajamas along with the sleepsack.  Just make sure to wash and dry these in hot water at least 3 to 5 times before using in order for the absorbancy to be more sufficient.  Glad I went with these over those over night diapers that NEVER work! No matter what brand.,5

Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"I loved the idea and really wanted it tot work, but there are flaws. The rim/seat is so thin and the hole so big my 3 year old had trouble sitting on it without bracing herself and it was not comfortable. I felt like I needed an extra seat on top of it. It was very sturdy and didn't slip when placed on a toilet. When used outside it was a bit low and my daughters thighs were not parallel with the ground at all.I liked the carrying bag, but the draw string had trouble holding it closed. We kept it, but I would not recommend it to others.",3
Chicco NaturalFit BPA FREE Baby Bottles and Nipples (5-Ounce Bottles and Newborn Flow Nipples (3-Pack)),"This bottle works great for my 6 month old son. We were using Dr. Browns, which also worked great for him seeing as he is a preemie, with feeding issues and GERD, but I couldn't take the leaking they are known for anymore, and we needed bigger bottles, and I didn't like the size/shape of there 8 ounce bottles. So we decided to give Chicco a try.These bottles work great. Wide opening on the top makes them easy to fill and clean. The nipple is very soft and my son seems to like it so far. They have the venting in the nipple, which seems to work good, and not to many pieces to clean and keep track of like the Dr. Browns bottles.We also tried the Avent bottles, and those were nice to, but if I didn't hold it at the perfect angle, all the milk would pour out of his mouth.",5
"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Froggy","We began using this when my daughter was 7 months old and she loves it. Her legs now touch the floor (she is around 32"""" tall). She can pick the blue bucket out and dump it in the big toilet and put it back in the froggy.",5

"Kaboost Portable Chair Booster, Green",I have used this Kaboost for a year and thought it was great.  But I noticed the plastic on the spring feet is broken on two arms near the connection in the middle.  This has been put on a chair no more than five times.  I am disappointed because I thought it would last through two grandkids.  I think bed risers are less expensive and do the same thing.,2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,Excellent diaper disposal unit.  I used it in conjunction with Glad 3ply kitchen trash bags with odor control (scented).  I am soooo pleased with this product!!! A wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose!!!,5
Summer Infant Secure Sounds Digital Multi Room Monitor,"We bought and set up this system last night.  I am taking it back to the store as soon as possible.  I would not recommend this monitor for any nighttime monitoring.Its Pros:+ Yes, the transmission is clearer than a non-digital monitor and interference is less of a problem.+ It probably has a longer range.+ There's no annoying static burst when the transmitter in the baby's room is turned off.Its awful, ill-thought-out characteristics, aka Cons:+ Cheap construction.+ Buttons are too easy to accidentally push.+ Every time you touch a button it emits a loud ""beep!"" to, oh I dunno, let you know you just touched a button...as if that weren't already obvious. Not too friendly a feature to a spouse that's trying to sleep, when every time the other spouse needs to adjust something at 3 in the morning the adjustment is accompanied by obnoxious loud beeping.+ To indicate which room it's monitoring, it constantly blinks a green or a blue LED light.  It's a fast blink and the lights are blindingly bright. It felt like there was a police car parked in my bedroom. What an awful, awful idea.  Who on Earth thinks it's a good thing to use an incessantly blinking LED light in a darkened bedroom? What IDIOT came up with this idea?  He should be found, captured, preferably beaten, and forced (a la Clockwork Orange) to look at this blinking light for hours.+ The volume control is subpar. Instead of having a dial where you can exactly customize the volume to your comfort level, it has 5 or 6 pre-determined volume settings. I think they should be named ""Mute"", ""Loud"", ""Is This Louder Than The Previous Setting Because I Can't Tell A Difference"", ""Really Loud"", ""Incredibly Loud"", and ""!*^#(!% Loud"". There is no ""low"" or ""medium"" setting that I can determine. So either you can't hear anything, or you're subjected to a constant hiss of white noise all night long.  No, it's not staticy, but I swear you can hear air molecules banging together.  Every toss and turn of your baby sounds like an airplane flying over your house.  A sudden cry is like a knife in your ear.I'm ready to toss this product out the window...what a piece of junk.  If your baby doesn't keep you up all night, this thing certainly will.  Do yourself a favor and spend a couple extra dollars to get a higher-quality dual-room monitor...I know there's not a lot of choice on the market, but I bet ALL the other choices are better than this one.  See my other product reviews to pick out my personal recommendation.",1
North States Supergate Expandable Swing Gate,"I ordered this product hoping it would be the perfect solution to keep my baby boy from going up the stairs.  The bottom of my stairs is in a kind of crowded area and I wanted the gate to expand and contract to fit into a small area when not in use.  Unfortunately, the gate stays very large and doesn't swing like I thought it would.  I returned it before even trying to install.  Disappointed this wasn't a good solution.  Back to the drawing board.",2
The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Raw chip - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/ &quot;The Art of CureTM&quot; Jewelry pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),"My daughter has been wearing an amber necklace since she was 6 months old. She is almost two and still wears it. Not only is it cute but I really think it has helped with teething. She also has ecze,a and someone told me it can help with that too.",5
"Regalo Extra Tall Top of Stair Gate, White","It installed easy enough, but the clips on the banister come off- that hold the straps - so we constantly have to redo those.  The clip on the top is a complete pain to open and close.  There is NO WAY to operate this unit without two hands.  The only reason I didn't rate it a 1 is after you spend the 2-4 mins jerking the thing around to close it - the babies can't open it -- so it does provide a level of safety.",2
Aidan 4-pc. Toddler Bedding Set,"The picture online is very deceiving. It looks as if it is more white or cream when in fact the bottom of the comforter and pillow cases are an awful blue.  I contacted the seller who promptly sent me a return label, however they also charged me for shipping it both ways($20).  I called the seller to let them know about the difference in the online picture and the actual product and all I got was a ""we're sorry"".  So I am out $20 for doing business with Waifair.  In my opinion, they are not a company to do business with.",1
Summer Infant Sure &amp; Secure Walk-Thru Gate,"This product is, without question, the worst I have purchased thus far. Forget about how it works, mine didn't even come manufactured at a 90 degree angle. I have never felt the need to post a review on this site until I got this piece of garbage into my home. I am convinced that the people that wrote positive reviews about this product have some sort of vested interest in this company. Don't buy this gate.",1
"Carters Everyday Easy Printed Boa Blanket, Ecru Circles",Blanket is very soft and stays soft through multiple washings. (Especially washed in cold water with fabric softener and dried on low heat). Colors do not fade in wash either.,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Early Walker Wearable Blanket, Baby Blue, Large","When you look at our 11 month old, he does look swallowed up in this item, but it works great.  It keeps him warm, gives him plenty of room to wiggle, and he's able to walk.  We have not had an issue with the legs falling down.",5
"Playtex Lil' Gripper/TrainingTime Straw Trainer Cup, 6 Ounce , Colors May Vary","This cup stinks. First of all I got a blue cup for my daughter. Secondly it spills every where very easily. Finally, my daughter cannot get the last 1/4 of the liquid out of the cup. Not worth the money.",2

The First Years Newborn to Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat,"I did a lot of research before settling on this chair for my daughter. I have a son and I wish I could've gotten this for him too.He is actually to small for his booster, but since he's used to it, he'll stay in it.We needed a seat for or daughter and once again, we were looking for a seat for a preemy.She loves it, assembly was easy, and try finding the quality, value, and a multytasking chair for this price.",5
8 oz Feeding Bottle with Warmer and Medium Flow Teat,"The bottle itself works great but the warmer does not. But the only reason I bought this was for the bottle warmer, so what a waste of money. It warmed twice then broke. Nothing good ever comes from England.",2
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 4 Pack Bunch-A-Bowls with Lids, Colors May Vary","We use these things quite a bit! They are the perfect size! I can hold it in one hand, so feeding is easy. I have never microwaved them, so I cannot comment on how well they hold up. however, we have placed them on the top rack of the dishwasher (numerous washings so far), and they are still like new! We have an 8 month old, and her servings fit in there perfectly. I pull her food from the freezer and place it in the bowls. From the fridge, diaperbag, house, or out and about, these bowls are perfect for feedings anywhere and everywhere! As she gets older, I am sure they will be great snack bowls. The lids close tight without accidents.",5
"FuzziBunz Perfect Size Cloth Diaper, Cotton Candy, Large 25-40+ lbs","I love these cloth diapers. I've just started using cloth diapers recently because my daughter started getting really nasty rashes and I love these diapers.  They're so soft and easy to use.  I also have the Grovia diapers and while those shells have the advantage of being re-usable while these are one time use, I like the fact that these Fuzzibunz ones have snaps rather than velcro.  I bought a couple so I don't mind that I have to wash them after each use.  The lining feels so soft.",5
"timi &amp; leslie Charlie 7-Piece Diaper Bag Set, Light Brown",Was so excited to have this as my diaper bag. First time I even went to pick it up the handle strap broke :( Horrible quality for how much I paid.,1
Munchkin Sea &amp; Learn Bath Shapes,"I'm currently looking to upgrade our bath toys to provide my toddler, and me, with a better bath experience, ie. more fun less drama. I looked at many toys and looked for educational, interactive, fun and price.You can't get too much more educational then ABC's and 123's. Since we've gotten these, we've worked on spelling our names, animals and of course counting and it's all been a blast for us both. These are well made, easy to clean and just plain work. I was a little skeptical about how well they would stick to surfaces around the tub, we have small tiles, but when wet, these stick to everything, even your forehead. Very happy I made this purchase and I will be looking for other products from this brand for bath toys as well.As I stated on another review, it's educational, fun, interactive and inexpensive, you can't go wrong.",5
"Barin Toys Teething Pendant, Tiny Bird","My pendant wasn't quite as smooth or &#34;shiny&#34;/polished as shown in the picture. The edges were a little more beveled, but nothing major. My baby loves playing with it and chewing on it whether he's in the Ergo, I'm just holding him, or I'm trying to change his diaper! :)It did cause a slight rash, but after boiling it for a couple minutes and letting the rash heal for a couple days, everything was fine and no more issues. The hole that the cord goes through had a few small splinters also, but I scraped them off and have had no problems with any more.Would definitely recommend for those with teething little ones, especially those who baby wear! :)",5
Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"I loved the Jumperoo with my first two sons,and I would give it five stars until today!  Today it broke and my third child ended up on his head hanging upside down.  After several babies and storing in the attic, the straps that hold the fabric seat all broke at the same time.  Just watch out and check your straps.",1

"Summer Infant SwaddlePod 2-Pack, Hungry Caterpillar, Newborn","With our first child we took the time to carefully swaddle him every time we laid him down. We were pros with those basic blankets. Now, with a newborn and a three year old running around, sometimes we need to swaddle the newborn as fast as possible.  the SwaddlePod is the perfect solution.

Since purchasing less than a year ago, I've had to replace the monitor 3 times, and a camera twice.  I am now returning it all and purchasing a different unit.  Good product if it would just continue to function!",1
Diono Radian Angle Adjuster,"First, I would have to agree that it's just a block of foam that you're paying for.  In fact, it's several layers of closed cell polyethylene foam bonded together to make one block.  I'll get the dimensions and details later if I remember.In any case, we recently purchased 2 Diono Radian RXT's for twin girls for a side-by-side, rear facing installation in the second row of our 2008 Acura MDX behind the driver's side and in the center. Without the angle adjuster, the Radian in the middle position requires the two front seat to be moved forward and more vertical to keep both Radian's from making contact with the back of the driver's seat.  The position directly behind the driver's seat would also cause the driver's seat to be moved forward regardless of whether there is a Radian in the center, just not as much.  While not unbearable with the seats moved forward and more vertical, it does get uncomfortable after about 30 minutes of driving and I'm only 5'8"".Now with the angle adjuster, we've gained at least 4 inches! I didn't bother to measure exactly how much we've gained, but I can now move both front seats back a few inches and change the incline to a comfortable position with room to spare.  The space gained will vary depending on the angle of your auto's car seats and the position of your front seats.  Also by adding the adjuster, the height of the car seat also increases, so if rear visibility was an issue with the Radian's before, well, now you just lost about 2 more inches of visibility with the additional of the angle adusterThe new incline of the Radian's also doesn't seem to effect the comfort level of my girls.  They fall asleep just as quick and they're heads aren't flopping forward.  It just doesn't look as comfortable to me as it did when the adjuster wasn't installed.",5
"Infantino Flip Front 2 Back Carrier, Black",This carrier is ok. It's not the most comfortable so if you are planning on using it for more than 30 minutes watch out. But I love that my baby can face out. As long as she's entertained she has no problem hanging out in the carrier. I also own the ERGO carrier which is far more comfortable but doesn't have the face-out option.,3
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Hippo","my 2 year old daughter loves this!  she brings it to bed every night.  very good buy.  colors are bright, but soft enough for a night light and the edges are smooth so she can sleep with it.",5
"Babasling Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Deep Blue","We didn't like this baby carrier because it is too complicated to use, takes to long to learn how to use it and baby didn't feel comfortable in it. We tried figuring it our from videos of other people using it, advertising videos, instruction manual. In the beginning while learning you have to be very careful and likely you'll  need help from another person. It looks easy in the video, but it isn't. We are very quick learners and can figure things out easily. This baby carrier was difficult to figure out and use. After trying it our for about 1h we had to send it back because it simply doesn't work. Our newborn doesn't fee comfortable in it. Baby's head wasn't getting support needed. We highly recommend following baby carrier:  BabyHawk Mei Tai Baby Carrier. It is well priced, easy to use and you can hold a baby up to 40 lbs.",2
Bummis Reusable Fleece Liners,Do not recommend this product at all.  Very thin liners and not worth the money even though it seemed reasonable at the time.,1
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner for Highchairs, Blue","The catch tray fits perfectly at the edge of the table where there is a gap on the  Inglesina Fast table chair.  The suction cups on the bottom do not work well, but the arms on the high chair keep them down. I purchased the green color and we only wash in the sink.",5
Holgate HZ633 Sportster Car Toy,"We own the newer version of this car. It's red all over, has racing stripes on the side and a big number 8 on the back. Its passengers are cheerful little yellow-painted men with hats, and pleasingly simple features (see both my customer images). Ours does not have the face on the vehicle, as the one pictured does.For Christmas we've ordered a number of catalogs with safe US and German-made toys, including Holgate's catalog, and have allowed our kids to browse through them and compose a wish list. When this little car struck my daughter's fancy, I was surprised. It didn't look exciting to me, but we were putting in a big order with Holgate, and the manufacturer's price is more than fair, so we figured we'd add it to her stocking (it's the perfect size for a stocking, by the way).I was pleasantly surprised when we received it. This car is much higher quality than the images might lead someone to believe. It doesn't just look like a replicate of an old-fashioned toy, it plays like one too. It's got good weight to it, the wheels make this pleasingly heavy wooden sound when traveling across the wood floors and the car travels smoothly and easily, just as you'd expect. The little passengers bob around in their 'seats' in a really sweet way too. When I think of a toy, this is what I think - this is the real deal.My only caveat is that the little men, who measure 2.5"" long by .5"" wide, seem like an obvious choking hazard. The packaging says 18 months+ (and the Amazon listing puts it at 2 years+), but unless you decide to put these little men away for awhile, I'd recommend this to the 3+ crowd. This is more an issue of labeling, in my mind, than one with the toy itself.All in all, a great toy. Safe paint and finishes, quality workmanship, and made in the USA.",5
Fisher-Price Tummy Fun Activity Mirror,I thought that the item would have 3 sides so that it would stand up when my daughter reached for it or batted at the toys.  It is more like a tent but has nothing to keep it standing up.  It ends up laying flat on the floor.  My daughter loves the toys and mirror but we've had to try different things to keep it standing up.  I was disappointed in it for a Fisher Price Toy.,2
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"We tried the genie for a week and were dissapointed in the small number of diapers you could put in before you had to change the bag (which are specially made for the Genie.)  If you are looking for a unit that uses standard kitchen trash bags, go with the Diaper Champ. It does not smell and it easily holds more than one days worth of diapers.",1
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue","I looked at many jumpers online and read all the reviews. I'm so glad I went to the store to check them out. This is the best jumper out there. The four point spring system is very sturdy unlike the other jumpers with three. At the store, the other jumpers were tippy, if you pushed on the side too much like a baby leaning over, the whole seat tipped over. I would never put my baby in one of those. This jumper is very easy to put together, very sturdy, and has provided hours of fun for the baby. The toys are average but the frame has multiple loops to attach your own toys and change them as much as you want. And they hold them in place so they don't slide down where the baby can't reach them. The springs are not to tight like many reviews state. The baby just has to learn how to jump in it. It took my baby about a month to figure it out and now you can't stop her. It is huge, but the whole house is filled with baby stuff, and I can have a half hour to get the dishes done while she's giggling the whole time. And the piano works fine and she can push the buttons easily, they must have fixed that problem.",5
"Summer Infant Swaddleme Sacks, Cheeky Cheetah, Medium","This was not our first Swaddleme, but it's certainly our favorite.  It's attractive & soft & best of all...there are 2 zippers!!

"Carters Everyday Easy Printed Boa Blanket, Blue Star","My son had a ""blankie"" since the day he was born and became attached to it so much he had to sleep with it every night.  It was called his ""star blankie"".  It went everywhere with him when he would spend the night at grandma & grandpa's, etc. We traveled to Michigan in October and spent 2 nights at a hotel. Needless to say, we lost the blankie during our stay.  We left word with the hotel and called them for a week afterwards inquiring about the blankie. My son was devastated!  I searched online for a new blue star blankie and came across this one.  It is almost identical to the original one we had.  I ordered it and my son absolutely loves it!  It is more plush and a little larger than his other one.  It has worked perfectly and now my son sleeps with his new blue star blankie!  He told us that this was a perfect new blankie. The blanket is quite comfortable and a baby would love to be cuddled in it. Way to go Carters! thank you!",5
Yookidoo Baby's First Bumper Book,"This was my second one I purchased after the first lasted about 3 months. Its an amazing product, and I love it, however, as I mentioned, my first one lasted three months, and this one lasted less than three weeks. I don't know what's flawed in it, but it's hard to imagine that I just randomly received two faulty products. Very sad.",1
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,I got this as a baby shower gift. And not shortly After we had our daughter. She Hated everything about being in her car seat. Lets just say this toy is a LIFE SAVER. This was the ONLY toy that would get her to stop crying while in her carseat...Better yet this was about the only thing to get her to stop crying!! She would stare at it forever. Shes 14 months and STILL loves this toy. she perfers it over any thousands of toys she has. They last forever. I've had to same one..granted the sticker on the button wore off a bit but  its still in great shape. A MUST HAVE,5
SoHo Pink Monkey Party Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"This is SO cheap and you get SO much for your dollar. This is adorable. I LOVE IT. It is VERY soft mateial for the blanket and bumper. The sheet that i received was not so soft but that doesnt matter to me because i have extra that i like even better than the sheet it came with. The back of my blankie is a pink, brown and green argyle and so is the sheet it came with. kind of neeto but doesnt really match, but i wont be using the back of the blankie anyways because the front is TOO CUTE. Im very happy with it for the money i spent i got so much. Good quality. I got NO complaints",5
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Elephant",This is our fourth one over four years for two kids. The only reason we had to replace any was due to loss and on one the button stopped working so it would not turn on unless it was on the base (this was on the t-rex)I love this product and the fact my two year old can just turn it on at night while she goes to bed and it shuts off after a short time.,5
"Trend Lab Fleece CribWrap Rail Covers for Crib Sides (Set of 2), Pink, Wide","The product does it's job (i.e. protecting the crib from my toddler's sharp teeth).  However, it had flaws right out of the package. One of the holes in each of the pieces was way too small for the tie piece to fit through, so I had to crudely cut the holes to make them bigger. It looks fine if you can see that part, but it is annoying that such a simple and overpriced product would have issues.  I was more concerned about protecting my son's rather expensive crib rather than having a perfect crib guard, so I didn't bother sending it back.",3
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack, Lavender or Citrus",i bought these for the closets in my house. While they work really good for my kids closets that are smaller they dont work as good for mine and my husbands closet. I put 2 in the big closet i mean it smells fresh i just would like a little more kick to it. I would definately recommend them they are great. maybe ill look to see if they have some that are a little bigger for my closet.,4
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","I bought this as a travel stroller while visiting family and love it.  It is easy to assemble, maneuver, push and take down.  It is not a full size stroller, does not recline much (which may be a problem for younger children - e.g. heads flopping forward), but it's fine for my 2.5 year old.  It doesn't have locking front wheels (have not had a need for this ever), nor does it have a huge visor, BUT it is sturdy, my DD loves it and finds it comfortable.  It has a 5 point harness (which isn't easy to find in a lightweight umbrella stroller, especially at this price point) and is very easy to push, turn and take down with one hand.  The sun shade isn't huge, but does an adequate job of keeping the sun out (I keep a lightweight blanket handy in case there is a need for more sun protection).  It has nice foam cushion handles and its height is good for taller people.Definitely buy this if you are looking for a cheap, but not flimsy alternative to a full size stroller.",5
"Dream On Me 6&quot; 2 in 1 Foam Core Crib and Toddler Bed Mattress, White","I purchased this awesome mattress for my two dogs &#128522; they are my kids too. I was tired of paying for dog beds that were pricey and hard to clean. How great is this?! Cover with a crib sheet thats easy to whip off, wash, remake, and I can wipe off the bed with actual spray cleaner. It keeps them elevated off our radiant heat floors and foam is better for their joints. My dogs sleep so good on this memory foam mattress....and they deserved a bed that comfy.",5

VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sounds Full Color Video and Audio Monitor,"We have purchased 4 other monitors and this is by far the best range wise. Our home isn't huge, its 2000 sq ft but we have 1/3 of an acre and needed a monitor that could be used in and outside and go through a large number of walls. All the other monitors fell short but this one has fantastic range &#8230; we set it up in our detached garage and are able to run it to the far side of our property through 3 bedrooms walls, a living room and kitchen and it doesn't affect the picture/sound quality.",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","I researched baby carriers quite a bit before I purchased the Baby Air. I love this because I'm pretty functional with my three month. We go on walks and I do a good amount inside our home. He loves it because he's pretty comfortable and so am I and the best part is he's close to my chest, so he can here my heartbeat. Which as a mother knows is a nice quality. It seems to calm him down to know he's with me and me be able to rock him and do things around the house too. I live in Salt Lake City and it can get pretty warm here in the summer. It was important for me to find something that will breathe on those hot summer days. Whats also a great part about the carrier is that it supports his head and I never have to worry about him bobbing around. The flap does fold down so when it comes to that time you can turn him around to face forward. It also has a small mesh bag built into the bottom strap to fold and travel with. Easy adjustable and really light. Great pick and I couldn't be happier :)",5

"Kids Line Jungle 123 High Pile Blanket, Brown","Perfect for my 18 month old, who is still in his crib, but is a large boy (size 3T/4T), so those baby blankets just don't cut it anymore.  These blankets are very soft and cozy, even after several washings, and big enough to keep him completely covered at night, and even allow him to tuck it around himself and burrow into it.  Deducted one star because one side is a little rougher than the other, but not so much to be uncomfortable or unusable.",4
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I'm very impressed by the audio on this unit.  You can really hear the smallest noise, even a clock ticking in a different room than the transmitter!I also bought this unit because both the transmitter and receiver can be AC powered or battery powered, so it's versatile as to where you can use it.The only downside is if you try to sleep with this on, the audio tends to get buzzy sometimes, some sort of interference.  Moving or reorienting the receiver seems to help, but it's a pain to have to fiddle with it.  Seems like with some digital signal processing or digital tuning that could be eliminated, but then again this is not an expensive unit so I don't expect miracles.",4
Dex Products Universal Safe Sleeper Bed Rail,"I searched and searched for a bed-side rail that accomodated twin beds without box-springs and this is it.....it works exactly as it explains - no hidden agenda here!!!  Yes, it's $40 but I can sleep knowing my two boys (13 months apart in age) will not fall off thier beds!",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","I have bought and returned at least half a dozen baby gates for various reasons.-Gates are not a tight fit with or without extensions-Tension rods are plastic not rubber. They end up sliding around when a baby pushes/pulls on it.-Gates do not fit dimensions claimed-Gates do not fit together at all when installed. They end up bowed, uneven, wobbly and worst of all dangerous.-Gate latch is unnecessarily hard to open even for an adult.The regalo gate has rubber rods with make loosening/tightening a breeze. It also creates a snug fit that does not move when tightened. The gate latch is easy to open and close and the optional lock is a useful feature.My only con is that the actual door in the gate is incredibly small. I've never seen one even remotely this tiny before. My wife and I are not large by any means, but we have to turn sideways through the gate to ensure we dont clip our hips or the babies legs on the gate.Other than that, for $30 bucks its definitely worth it.Minus 1 star for the ridiculously tiny door.",4
"BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Booster Seat, Gray/Black/Green","I have the Fisher Price travel high chair and it has been great for trips to grandparents houses and for the beach (driving distance), but there was no way I was packing it to go on vacation out of the country. So I took a chance on the BRICA even though I thought it looked flimsy. I was wrong. It worked great for a 15 month old, 24 lb wiggly little boy. I was nervous about the lack of 5 point harness, but the 3 point worked fine. The best part is how flat it folds and how light it is.Reasons it's 4 instead of 5 stars:- No tray (not that big of a deal)- The canvas material (although great for lightweight travel) isn't the easiest to clean, but isn't the hardest to clean either- It sits pretty far back of the chair which not only exposes the chair seat to spills but could make pushing the child up to the table difficult with the wrong kind of table (one's where the chairs can't go far underneath)Even with the cons this chair is definitely worth it, you will not regret it.",4
"Luvable Friends Drooler Bib with Water Proof Backing, 3 Pack, Blue",Amazing buy...u will love it.Bought it for my four month old and its all she uses now....I promise that you will want to buy some more. Wonderful!,5
Cosco Juvenile Pronto Belt-Positioning Booster Car Seat,"I bought this booster seat in the grey colored fabric for my middle child. When we got it out of the box, and put it together, the overall look is nice, but has some flaws.1. The back doesn't connect as sturdily as I would like. Seems to be a bit flimsy for a safety seat.2. While you can use the sealt belt positioners on either side of the booster, it only has a cupholder on one side. This means if you put it on the drivers side, the cupholder doesn't have enough room to pull out in a lot of cars (including ours).3. The width of this booster is 17 inches, which is a full inch wider than our other booster (a Graco TurboBooster). One inch may not sound like much, but makes a world of difference when you are trying to fit three children in the backseat of a Camry.This Cosco booster does have very nice padding and the upholstery seems like it would be much easier to clean than our Graco one, which would be really nice. However, the width/cupholder issues are dealbreakers for us, so it will be going back to the store in exchange for a TurboBooster. Would be great for single child families - or even families with only two children- but not for three, unless you drive something with more seats than a 4 dr. sedan.",3
"Stork Craft Tuscany Glider and Ottoman, Cherry/Beige","Hate to say it, but we are now returning this after only 15 minutes of putting it together.  We were so excited.  Unpacked the box, put it together (very easily, even though it didn't come with enough bolts -- but turns out it didn't matter anyways), sat on it.... and realized that we really do get what we pay for.  We wanted to save some $$ and go with what we thought was a good deal on Amazon with this glider+ottoman but the arm rests are inadequate for nursing, your neck will be strained because there isn't quite enough padding on the backrest (nor is it tall enough for even someone who is 5'5"") and you can tell the cushions won't last very long. There is no way you'll be rocking your baby (nor yourself) to sleep on this glider... too uncomfortable.Packing it back up to return it took longer than setting the whole thing up.  Bummer.  Time to start researching again.",1
"Colgate Classica III Foam Crib Mattress, White",We have read many reviews on mattresses for our little one. This consistently comes up as people's number one choice and we can now see why. This mattress has a firm and softer side to support infants and toddlers. It fits in our crib perfectly and we have had no issues at all.,5
Munchkin 3 Count Stay Put Suction Bowl,"this is a must buy, i love it, its sooooo easy to clean, actually sticks on the ground, and it stays, till of course you want to take it out, i hold my little one while make his food, and it wont fall off, and then, while i feed him, he tries to turn over the plate, but it doesn't. turn over, i could go on and on, i recommend this product",5
Zippy Fun Bandana Bibs for Baby Boys and Toddlers (Brum Brum! Pack of 4),"These are a cute alternative to the classic bib. My 6 month old is constantly wet and these do absorb pretty well, but mostly I use these as an accessory rather than a bib. they tend to shrink after washing fyi",3

Rainbow (5 Colors) Interlocking foam Wonder Mats: 36 Pieces at 12&quot; X 12&quot; X ~9/16&quot; Extra Thick,"I purchased 36sqft (36 of the 1'x1' tiles) and this created the perfect space for my daughter when paired with the North State play yard (with 2-piece extender). As a parent, I was able to give my child her own space to crawl, explore and yes, fall down, without worrying about injury. My daughter's first steps were taken on this mat and I can't tell you how many times she has fallen on this mat while learning to walk or play. She has never cried from the falls and I can attest that the foam is very comfortable and protective.It is also important to point out that these tiles DON'T SMELL! Many cheaper quality foam mats have a horrid smell (usually from volatile chemicals off-gassing). Brand new, these tiles had a faint smell from the plastic packaging but it went away after a couple of days. When compared to tiles from other expensive stores (Buy Buy Baby or Pottery Barn Kids), those tiles made me want to heave after being exposed to their odor.Cleanup is pretty easy on the tiles. If there are too many juice/milk spills, gather up the tiles and wipe down with mild soap or all-purpose cleaners and let air dry. At one point, my daughter had spilled so much juice on these tiles it essentially glued the tiles to my hardwood floor. After a few minutes of carefully 'tearing' the tiles and floor apart, I was surprised that the tiles didn't sustain any damage from this process! A quick trip to the sink with hot water and dish soap later and they were back in action.How satisfied am I with these tiles? I just purchased another 48sqft of tiles to create another play area for my second child. There is no better tile on the market.",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,The monitor did an excellent job picking up the sounds from our baby's room for the 1 week it worked.Battery IssuesPlugged this in the day after our baby was born and charged the parent unit for around 8 hours.  A couple of days later we set up the unit while our newborn took a nap and the battery was almost dead.  Not sure how that happened as we did not use the at all in the 2 days between the charge and first use.  After charging for a few hours I removed it from the cable and it did report a full charge.  Used this 2 times after for a total of 3 hours and the parent unit reported a depleted battery each time.  The battery appears to drain when not in use.  This would be fine if it was over the course of a few days but it drains over night.Link IssuesOn the 3rd use the unit would not link.  We turned off both units and left them off for ~5 minutes and when we turned them back on they started working again.  After 30 minutes the parent unit started beeping reporting that it had lost the link.  We reset both sides and they connected again.  On the 4th use it would not connect at all with the reset not helping.Overall very disappointed.  This unit gets good reviews at the price but it seems its hit or miss on quality.,1

"L A Baby Coconut 240 Coil Inner Spring Crib Mattress, Gold","This mattress is great! Exactly what I was looking for for baby... chemical free, organic and soft cover (not the cheap plastic ones you typically see). Love that is has a firm side for baby and softer side for toddler years...My ONLY complaint was the manufacturers description (when I bought it)- said it included an organic waterproof mattress cover... but it didn't arrive with one. So I called Amazon customer service, and they refunded the $39.99 it would cost me to buy one separately (I guess it's doesn't come with one). I did advise they should update the description then as it's misleading.Overall happy with mattress- hope it works great when baby arrives!!!",4

Safety 1st Oven Front Lock,"We've had this on our oven now for at least 6 or 7 months, now, maybe a year.  It is still holding strong.  I'm actually surprised at how well this has worked out, since the only thing holding it on is the adhesive.  I was initially skeptical, but I've tested it by pulling pretty hard on the oven door, and it doesn't budge.  The way that it flips up is nice, because once the kids go to bed you can flip it up and leave it flipped up so that you can open and close the oven without having to open and close the lock every time you use the oven.  While in use, it is only slightly annoying to use the lock to open and close the oven, and is definitely possible to open and close with only one hand.I don't know whether this may only work with certain oven configurations, but it works great with mine.It's convenient enough to use, and is surprisingly strong.",5
The First Years Natural Comfort Breast Pump,"I have to agree with those who say it is good for occasional use only. I first experienced problems with the pain I felt from the sheild, the bumps are left embedded on your breasts. But even that wasn't the worst. After only a few uses it began to clog in the small compartment and overflow, unless the suction was broken to release. Which causes the process to take longer. I am now back to work and am looking for a more agreeable pump.",2

I even bought the travel version for my trips, which was useful but this one is by far the most sturdy and comfortable. I can't recommend it more highly.",5
Chewy Charms Chewable Tube Necklace by Chew Stixx,"The item has a strong taste of rubber. My son is having a hard time getting past that.  I thought I was getting 6 necklaces and only received One.

"North States Supergate Extra Tall Easy Close Gate, Bronze","This gate was placed in a hallway to keep a grandchild out of our bedroom, office, and guest bathroom. In that regard it works perfectly. My one concern was whether it would prevent our cat from getting to her food and litterbox, however she jumps over it easily.The installation, especially with the extensions, can be tricky. I laid the gate down on the carpet, fitted the pins and extensions on, then used the plastic protective wrapping to tie the extensions to the gate frame. Another piece was used to hold the gate in the closed position. This made the assembly much easier to manage.My installation process went as follows. 1) With a 36"" level, make two pencil marks slightly above where the disks will go. Use a roofing square or other large right angle to transfer a matching baseboard mark to the other side. Don't bother making the other mark on the other part of the wall.Dry fit the cups on the first wall centered under the marks. Fasten the baseboard cup to the wall. Dry fit the upper cup and fasten that in place next. Now place the baseboard cup on the other side. At this point, start extending the screws for the pressure fit. Keeping the upper gate frame free on the opposite side will allow you to make the small adjustments for the gate to close square. Once that's achieved, mark where the cup is set, tilt the gate down, fasten the cup to the wall, and retighten the pressure screws.",5
"Skip Hop Bento Diaper Tote Bag, Black","I have been on the hunt for the perfect diaper bag for a long time now. Two have torn on me in the past year, and I needed to find one that will last. For weeks I have been researching and reviewing diaper bags, and I finally bought this Skip hop Bento bag in Olive.  At first, I didn't like this bag at all. It didn't fit all my junk as well as other bags (or so I thought), because the main compartment is shallow due to the food compartment at the bottom.  However, after using this bag for a month, I really have grown to love it.  First, the food compartment at the bottom of this bag is huge, and amazing.  If all the food is stored in that compartment, it keeps the rest of the bag crumb free. I love the three containers it comes with too. The lids snap on really well, and they are the perfect size.  However, the entire lunch bag does not fill the bottom compartment all the way which leaves the bag unstable.  Even when I add a few other snacks, the bag is still awkward.  However, unless I am packing a lunch, or need to keep something cold, I dont carry around the entire lunch container, I just put the individual small containers in the bag, and there is still room for a lot of other food and snacks.  The bag seems to be more stable that way as well. I do LOVE the bottom compartment, but sometimes it is hard to access it if the bag is in the car, or pushed up against the wall.  Another thing I really love about the bag is the side insulated pockets that zip up for sippy cups and bottles.  I wish all bags had that feature.  The pockets are really big, and can fit any size bottle or sippy cup. My son needs his milk everywhere we go, so it is nice because the insulated pockets keeps the milk cold for longer, and keep the bottle clean since it zips up. As I stated earlier, the main compartment of the bag is really shallow because of the snack compartment at the bottom.  There are pros and cons about this. The nice part is that since it is not so deep, it is easier to find everything in the bag.  Items dont get lost in the bottom like they do in other bags. The con is simply that you can't carry as much in the top as other bags, or things that are big.  I used to carry coloring books and other long toys, but they dont fit as well in this bag. However, since I can carry all my food in the bottom compartment, I do have more room in the top for other items. Also, there are a lot of pockets on the outside that are perfect for organizing my items.  There is a nice big zipper compartment on the very outside for my glasses, hand sanitizer, gum, and so on.  THen, there is a small zipper pocket perfect for a cell phone and keys.  Then, there is a nice large zipper compartment next to the main compartment.  I keep my wallet, makeup, and other similar items in there.  It is all very well organized, and easy to find. I dont like  the changing pad because it is really small, and is not made for a toddler or a large baby.  I am using my jjcole changing pad because it is a lot better. Lastly, the fabric seems to be extremely durable. The bag is  built tough, and I think it will last for a while.  I am rough on my diaper bags, so hopefully this one will last. The color is nice too.  It is by no means a gorgeous bag, however, it is very functional.  I have purchased a lot of 'pretty' bags, but the quality and functionality has never been equal to this bag.  Overall, I really like this bag.  It helps to keep me well organized, and the material is very durable. It is big enough to accommodate my needs with two kids, and it has room for all my items so I dont need to carry an additional purse.",5

Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,"We just purchased this seat for my 8 month old daughter.  We have an old fashioned cast iron clawfoot tub.  The arm rest didnt even come close to fitting in the tub.  Which, by the way, the armrest is the dumbest idea ive ever seen.  You have to fill the tub up so high so the kid is actually in the water.  Also, my daughter loves to splash in the water.  When she leans forward to do this, the seat leans forward with her and almost tips over.  I have to keep a hand on the seat the whole time im bathing her.  There is also a sharp plastic seam in the front of the seat.  It scratches my daughters stomach every time we use it.  Im walking out the door right now to throw it in the dumpster.

bumGenius One-Size Cloth Diaper Twilight,"I have been using Bum Genius 3.0 one size diapers on my son since he was 4 weeks old and he is now almost 13 months old.  I have 24 of these and LOVE them.  I only used disposable diapers on my daughter (who is now 4) and she got diaper rash all the time.  Plus in disposables she had diaper """"blow-outs"""" all the time.  I rarely if ever have diaper leakage with these.  I love all the colors and they wash up well as long as you follow the manufacturer's recommendations on washing.  I use Tide Free and Clear to wash them and use bleach in a load about once a month with no fading.  I am saving SO much money over disposables.  I really wish I had used these for my daughter too.  There are a million types of cloth diapers out there and I've only used a few brands but I still think these are the best.  I love that they are one-size and grow with my son.  I don't mind that they are the """"pocket"""" diapers and am more than willing to stuff the inserts back in after they are dry from the dryer.  Excellent diapers.",5

I was (and stil am) excited about cloth diapers, the long-run savings I was netting, and of course, the super cute colors that disposables (Pooh Bear and Elmo notwithstanding, pardon my eyeroll) just don't provide.Let me start with the features I like about FuzziBunz. The colors are great. The microfiber liner wicks moisture away from my son's skin, and is super-soft; the liners are absorbent and well-stitched. And once I had the sizing figured out for my son, I definitely don't have the blow-outs that he is prone to in disposables. The colors are bright, and they look great! The snaps, so far, hold great.My biggest complaint about FuzziBunz regards the sizing/elastic. What a PAIN. The sizing chart they provide isn't a catch-all for every kid, obviously, and as they go through several growth spurts in the first couple of months, it's almost not worth it to use them when you have to change the elastic over and over and over. The elastic tails don't stay in the little ""pocket"" they've provided, usually curling into a fiddlehead fern-like spiral outside of the microfiber. Once you get past a 3 or 4 in the legs, even the small inserts don't fit all the way. And often, there is usually some small leakage from the leg gussets.All in all, if I had it to do over again, I'd return the FuzziBunz for some BumGenius or Bumpkins with snap adjustments over the elastic!",3
Lamaze My First Mirror,The toy is cute like all Lamaze toys but the mirror - which is the most important part of it - is not like a regular mirror.Other reviews said the mirror is great but I disagree.,3
"BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Booster Seat, Gray/Black/Green","This travel seat is a lifesaver! Very easy to transport, keep in your vehicle, or pack in your bag for a trip! We purchased this because we were spending a week at my husband's grandmothers who has nothing kid-friendly. We wanted to still be able to secure our son for mealtimes, and this worked great! Attaches quickly and easily to any chair and is very sturdy! It puts the kiddo right at table height for easy feeding. I was weary that the fold up bottom/platform would be flimsy, but it is very strong and I feel comfortable with my wiggly son in there!We have since recommended this to friends, and use it frequently when out and about when highchairs aren't available!",5
Nuby Monster 7oz Monster 2 Handle No-Spill Sippy Cup- 4M+,"My Grandson always has something to drink in his hands and thought this would be a fun cup to have. He is getting it for his Birthday along with several other Nuby Monster items for his Birthday on Friday, he should love it!",5

"C.R. Gibson Bound Keepsake Memory Book of Baby's First 5 Years, Lulu",I bought this for my daughter's daughter because my daughter is a no-frills person.  It is a good size with just the right number of pages.  It has pretty &#34;girl&#34; features without being frilly.,4
Philips AVENT DECT Baby Monitor with Temperature Sensor and New ECO Mode,"I didn't think I would need a monitor since my house is so small, but I love this product.  I like having the temperature display.  The LED lights catch my attention if I don't hear her right away.  The sound sensor that sets off the LED lights is very sensitive.  THey light up when the train whistles blow behind our house.",5
2 Pack Organic Muslin Baby Swaddle Blankets &amp; Bonus eBook. Unisex 100% Breathable Cotton Receiving Blankets for Boys or Girls. The Best Baby Gift Blanket Set for Newborns and Infants. Cotton Swaddle Baby Blanket Set in Exclusive Design of Just Caterpillars with Red &amp; Yellow Colors for Visual Development.,"Great swaddle blankets! Got them as a present for our second child. I like that they are of decent size. You can definitely use them way after your baby grows into toddler, pre-schooler etc. as a summer blanket. Also, the more you wash them the softer they get. Great product.",5
Britax Child Cup Holder,"I'm sorry to say this, but this cup holder is terrible!!! I mean the first time I put it on the car seat it fell off right away. Seriously, my baby didn't even touch it and it fell off, that's how terrible this thing is. It came free with the purchase of my car seat, but I don't think Britax should even make this cup holder anymore. It's a joke!",1
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Brontosaurus","I bought two of these for my grandsons. They are really adorable. They get charged on the base and can be taken offf the base and put next to the child. If I remember correctly, they change colors as well. I only saw them out of the box when they opened them and set them up for charging. This is a very nice gift for a child that sleeps with a night light.",5
"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","This bag is great.  It has just enough pockets and is big enough to fit EVERYTHING!  It is a little fancy though so it may look a little strange if you're running around in gym clothes.  Also, it is big so it will be more than you need for a really quick trip to the store or to pick up older kids from school.  However, if you like to have everything at your fingertips and look stylish too, this is the bag for you.",5
Yookidoo Stack 'N' Spray Tub Fountain,"My kids love this Yookidoo Stack 'N' Spray Tub Fountain...we've now had it for about 4 years, and definitely got my money's worth.  As you interchange each boat, whether stacked as illustrated with all three, or two or one, the water sprays differently.  Also, when you put the yellow or red additional attachments on top of the light blue or blue boat, the spray differs.  And if no item is on the green base where the water shoots up from, the water sprays up high like a mini geyser, which sure brings lots of laughs.  My kids love this toy so much, they don't get bored with it at all.  I even wanted to get for a friend, but this toy is hard to find.",5
CTA Digital 2-in-1 iPotty with Activity Seat for iPad,"So I bought this potty trainer with every intention of teaching my toddler the joys of pottying while fully distracted by technological media.Everything was going just wonderfully until, in a fit of excitement and hand-waving over the wonderfully detailed graphics on my ipads HD screen - my two year old sprayed the walls, the floor, me - and my ipad!It was too late to return the ipad and unfortunately my insurance does not cover urination-by-toddler, but I am most DEFINITELY returning this pee magnet.Thanks alot CTA >:-(",1
Dream Collection Doll Feeding Time Set with Pacifier,"This could not be further from the description and picture--the only thing as described was the milk bottle. Instead of a sippy cup was another smaller bottle with &#34;juice.&#34; And no bib or pacifier. Both bottles contain some liquid substance made to look like milk or juice (really the &#34;juice&#34; looks more like an orange julius). And it grosses me out to think what toxic chemicals are in there, I just hope the bottle doesn't break and they leak out. And the milk bottle has a rounded bottom so doesn't stand on its own. All in all, an awful product. But I will admit my daughter likes playing with it, so I ended up keeping it.",1
"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","Very roomy and practical. Nothing negative to say about this bag, it doubles as a purse and a diaper bag. I can fit everything for my little one and for myself, and it looks great!",5
Basic Comfort Neck Wings - Navy,"They are absolutely wonderful, especially for the hot weather down here in Charleston. They allow baby's head to be supported, yet do not trap heat at the crown like most other head supports. We used these with our first born three years ago and after she grew out of the infant carrier we stored them for the next.  Any day now I will have a baby boy, and I have searched frantically for those little supports!  The velcro allows you to easily put on and take off for cleaning and adjusting harness as baby grows.  I haven't found our old ones, so I am most relieved to find that BabiesRUs is still carrying them.  I will definitely buy another set of these for our boy!",5
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"1. I had to wait for 2 weeks to get it2. I ordered it twice cause the first one was absoluetly damaged from the box to the product, & guess what the second one was no different absoluetly damaged3. The product alone seems weak and lacks the steady feelAll in all I was dissapointed with the product but then Amazon Took care of me which makes me a happy customer",1
Philips Avent Toddler Spout Cups - 2 Pack - 7 Oz - 6m - Pink,"Our daughter was using the Nuk sippy at 8 months then one day just refused them... and every other sippy on the market. I realized the large harder silicone spouts that come on almost all sippy cups just did not work for her. We decided to try the Avent due to the flat, small spout. She took to it immediately. The handles are easy to hold, liquid flows at a good pace, and air is easily exchanged through the vent. The flip top lid on ours has a slight &#34;catch&#34; when it's open all the way so for now, the lid doesn't fall forward. We've only used these a week so that may or may not last. Another bonus to the lid is that, with it closed, it helps you align the spout with the handles, since the handles are attached to the collar.  On occasion my daughter will shove the cup against her face, causing her nose to block the air valve but she just pulls it out of her mouth a second and the air quickly flows back in the sippy. My only beef with this cup is that the handles aren't removable so we'll have to figure out something different when she gets a bit older, and since the handles are attached to the collar they have to be washed every time. We've had zero leaks. I noticed that, when you think the spout is all the way in, there is one tiny section that still needs to be seated. This may be where others are complaining of leaks. I always run my thumb around the entire inside collar to ensure the spout is on all the way. However these are extremely minor annoyances and I'm just glad we found something our daughter likes!",5

"Foscam FBM3501 Digital Video Baby Monitor - 2.4 Ghz with Pan/Tilt, Nightvision and Two-Way Audio/Video Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD (White/Gray)","I previously had the Motorola, until my son dropped the monitor on the floor.  I ordered this because I did not want to spend $250 again.  I've had it for about 2 weeks and am impressed for the price.  The sound is great.  The picture is clear enough to see well.  It's not quite as clear as the Motorola but good enough.  The camera tilts well with the controls, which my Motorola did not.  The temperature sensor seems accurate, more so than the Motorola.  I gave it 4 stars because with a sound machine, the monitor picture cannot be turned off.  I'd rather not play with the brightness every time I wanted to see the picture at night, so it takes some getting used to to sleep next to the bright light.  Still worth it for the price though and I would recommend it to others,",4
Sensible Lines Milk Trays,I am glad I purchased this product. I really like that the milk can be stored in 1 oz portions. It is useful for the extra milk pumped. Only con is you have to move very slow when bringing it to the freezer even if you don't fill it to the top as directed. There is a tendency for some spillage so be cautious. Other than that am pleased.,4
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","We got this as a baby gift before the baby was born. We used the sling until he was about 2-3 months old. It was wonderful, the baby never slid around, he was very secure. Then we switched him to the infant side. We had to watch his head because sometimes he would slouch from one side to the other, but that was really only because he was still kind of small. Once he could sit up, we switched him to the toddler side. He is now turning one and still loves the bath tub. All his toys can float in the tub with him, and even at a year old, he still has room to kick and splash. We are going to be moving him to a bath seat, but only because we have another on the way, and want to use the sling for the newborn!",5
Sassy Developmental Sensory Ball Set - Inspires Touch,"Stitching on fabric seemed mediocre, giant ugly taghad to be cut off. Plastic bell cage ball isn't nearly as nice as an oball. Oballs are firm but also squish under pressure and are really easy for little fingers to grasp. Baby likes blue ball better than dollar store balls because it's slightly deflated and easy to pick up and hold. A mini beach ball would serve the same purpose. A slightly deflated mini Pilates ball is really fun big ball for baby. These Might be good for tummy time but we got them after that phase. Good colors and concept.",3

Ameda One Hand Breast Pump- BPA Free,"My pump came in the mail from a different seller. I tried it right away. It wasn't good with suction at first. I kept pumping it, and I got it to work well after a few minutes. I got used to how it pumped best after a couple of practice runs.The only issue was the squeaking. I thought of putting Vaseline on the 4 joints with a q-tip. I wiped off the excess.It worked after a few minutes of pumping so now it's quiet. I have a Medela Lactina, and I had an Avent hand pump years ago. They all work well to fill up a baby bottle. I got 4 ounces total with the Ameda in about 10-15 minutes. That's one feeding for my baby. I got the Ameda because I wanted a small pump for my diaper bag because my 6 week old baby doesn't latch well. I'm not comfortable nursing in public with him struggling to latch. I usually take two 4 ounce bottles with us on errands, but he ran out of milk once. I didn't want to have that problem again. I think this pump is good for 1-2 pumping sessions a day or for a diaper bag just in case it's needed. The green pump part does feel a bit flimsy, but I think it will be fine for what I need. I would definitely buy it again for occasional use.",4

Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System Complete,"This is an excellent product!! It works great and what is really neat about it is the fact that the key is magnetic which is really awesome. My children will definitely not be able to figure this out, especially since the key will be out of reach. The only thing that is bad about this product is that it is impossible to follow the directions. They make no sense whatsoever. So, I basically had to figure out how to install these myself which was very difficult and took alot of my time. Extremely frustrating but the product works great once you get past the installation part. If you have the patience to figure out things like this than the product is worth getting, if not don't bother.",4
Fisher-Price Step &amp; Play Piano,"My boy liked the piano when he was too little to stand on his own.  However, he didn't really like to sit it in for more then 10 minutes or so.  Once he was about 8 months old (he's 10 months now) and could stand on his own, we removed the seat so he cound stand/walk on the keyboard and cruise all around the toy, inside, outside whatever.  He loves the thing.  It's a bit large for our den, but our boy really enjoys this thing and it will stay in our den until he no longer likes it.",5
"Britax Boulevard 70 Convertible Car Seat, Silver Birch","I have to admit I was a bit turned away by the price of this item since it was near the top of the price point, if not the most expensive car seat on the market. However, after reading many reviews of the produce both on Amazon and from some outside reviewing sources I was convinced. The seat itself is extremely durable and allows for easy installation by a professional installer or law enforcement official.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"First time mom here. My baby is 3 months old. I bought this knowing it would be too big for him (but it was on sale). He has become bored with sitting in his bouncer and laying on playmat. He actually fit well into the seat and was able to jump once I put a pillow under his feet. There is plenty of room in the seat for him to grow into. It's not too big that he slips out. He enjoys the lights and noises/songs. They (thankfully) shut off on their own and only restart with movement. He is able to turn them on with his jumping. He even enjoys the two things that hang down. He is still too small to reach the various toys. I'm sure I will be using this for awhile.A little difficult to transport so I will be being another one to keep at grandma's house.Pros: lots of toys to keep him entertained. sturdy base, no fear of tipping over. easy instructions. easy dismantling for transport to grandma's.Cons: the pieces don't fold very small, making transport a little cumbersome.",4
Peg Perego Venezia SNG Carriage / Stroller - Chesapeake,I purchased this stroller while still pregnant because of all the great reviews I've read. But no where was it ever mentioned the effectiveness on steps or public transportation. This stroller is in no way made for apartment living if you dont have a wheelchair ramp. I live on the first floor of a walk up building and have 2 short steps into the building then 4 steps to the first floor. Can you believe that the break gets engaged going up or down the steps and locks stroller onto step between step and footrest. I called the company and they said this stroller has to be totally lifted up and down the steps. How realistic is this? This has become the most expensive baby seat for in the house and can only be taken out when I have someone with me. I had to invest in a Mclaren Techno XT.,2
"Tadpoles Playmat Set, Modern/Multi","I looked at the Skip Hop and this and read all the reviews on both. Clearly the Skip Hop is a flawed product. The Tadpoles mats are not perfect either, but considering the problems people had with the Skip Hop I think that the Tadpoles deserve 4 stars.The squares are easy to assemble, stay together well, even on a rug and when walked on. The colors are great, very hipster and more appropriate for space shared by adults and baby's. It stays reasonably clean and wipes down pretty well.There are two reasons why I did not give it 5 stars and I think anyone buying the Tadpoles product should be aware of these issues. They don't bother me so much, but could be a deal breaker for you:1) Thin pads - the foam pads are not very thick at all. It seems they are intended more to provide a surface for your baby to play on and protect their knees and such versus really absorb a fall or flop while trying to crawl or stand/walk. Other reviews have said that this is normal for such mats, but looking at some of the other mat products on Amazon it appears there are some that are thicker, just none that are both thick and cool looking.2) Removable circles - the circles in the middle of the pads can be taken out and mixed and matched. This makes for more interesting designs, but they pop out pretty easy (compared to the interlocking squares themselves which remain very well attached to one another).The circles popping up doesn't bother me really, but I do wish the mat was thicker - thus only 4 stars.",4
Playtex SmartSpace Drying Rack,Love the fact that you dont have to keep the two parts together. I keep one by the sink and one by the stove (since we boil bottles) works out great. Wish the small cup that attaches to the side fits in a little better but over all it does the trick. Oh and the fact that you can throw the drying mats in the washing machine is pretty handy as well.,5
Mud Pie Baby Classic Keepsakes Silver-plate Cross Cup,"The item is pretty cute, but it's a little on the tiny side.

A cute keepsake.",3

"Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey","After buying some cheap potty seats and cleaning up the bathroom a lot, we ordered this weePOD and it is the winner!It is very easy to wipe clean, it is so cushy that my son can sit comfortably for a while! It has a splash gaurd in the front which is key for little boys! The back helps guide to sit forward instead of slouching backwards which can lead to a mess. I never review product but this was worth it! Potty training is time consuming and I am happy that I found this amazing seat!",5

The First Years Ignite Stroller,I do like how it is built for someone who is a bit taller. My partner is 5'10 and has no problem pushing the kiddos around. It is rather lightweight and that could be good for someone who is traveling.. but in the same breath.. that also makes it feel a bit cheap to me.I do wish it had a snack tray...,3

Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,I've had an alpha omega for 3 years and love it.  Its great because it can be used from 5-80 lbs.  For the reviewer that said he has no room when the child is rearfacing - that is true for every rear facing seat I've seen.  The puzzle clasp is designed so that the kid can't get out which is great b/c my child can buckle the top but there's no way she can do the bottom lock which makes it more secure,5
"Summer Infant Sure and Secure Deluxe Bedrail, Pink n' Plush","I bought two of these for my daughter's bed.

Really, really happy with this purchase.",4

Jolly Jumper Bath Tub Toy Bag,"Easily sticks onto our tile walls around the bath tub.

HOWEVER, when it arrived I was not too pleased as the instructional diagrams were hard to follow and I spent 2 very long nights putting it together and when I got done I didn't have enough long screws for the handles and had to run to the hardware store. It's wonderful when done but at times I asked myself if it would get done.",4

Easily holds up to 5-6 diapers, possibly more, depending on the size of your diapers. It contains any odor and cleans easily. It has also shown to be very durable so far. The pacifier pouch is nice for the car, diaper bag, or my purse. I can throw a couple extra pacifiers in and I know they are kept clean for when we need them.

"Summer Infant Spectra Stroller, Blaze","Over the course of my life, I have worked with a number of strollers, and I must say that this is easily one of the best ones that I have used. It was easy to assemble, taking only a few minutes. It's lightweight and compact when folded, which makes getting it into and out of a car trunk is a snap. It also folds and unfolds easily enough.It rolls smoothly on its wheels and maneuvers quite easily in stores and other tight spaces. I liked the storage pockets, which are well placed for keys, iPod, etc. I do, though, wish that it had another cup/bottle holder.It's an excellent stroller, one that is makes life that much easier for those of us with a little one!(Review of Summer Spectra Stroller by Summer Infant)",5
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"I was looking for something to act not only as a occasional in-bed co-sleeper, but also to help transition my daughter from the hammock-like bassinet to her crib and also to be a travel bed. This product does it all! She no longer feels lost in her crib and I took the sleeper in a suitcase (and was able to pack clothes in it to save space) and visited several different friends without having to worry about a pack-n-play or crib. It comes completely apart to machine wash and really is a great product. Sure... eventually she'll grow out of it (she is three months now), but I knew that in purchasing it. It is very sturdy and impossible for the sides to collapse and has plenty of side ventilation. I am extremely happy with this purchase (maybe the best thing I've purchased so far)!",5
"Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stroller, Blueberry","Whereas the concept of this stroller is nice, it was not functional for our needs and now we have to pay the shipping to send it back to Amazon.  It's funny because the outside of the box screams ULTRALIGHT; however, this stroller still has some weight to it.  40+ lbs, I believe.  Certainly not easy to handle when you're in a pinch with two small kids.  There is a process to open the stroller and a process to close the stroller....again, not very user friendly when in a pinch with two small kids.  Out of the box, this stroller is very easy to put together and extremely durable.  Testing it around the house, it is very easy to push and turn; however, the brakes take some effort to push on the back wheels and you physically have to lock each front wheel if you don't want them to turn left or right.  We were able to deal with all the issues mentioned above since they're not the end of the world; however, when it came time to use the stroller, it became apparent that it wasn't going to be functional for what we needed it for at this point in time. We have a 2-yr old who can ride the back and a one-month old, who will need her car-seat (Chicco Key Fit 30) attached to the front of the unit.  Attaching the car seat is not as simple as 1-2-3.  Again, a process and at that, it didn't seem fully secure as if it were attached to the Chicco stroller.  With that now said, here's the kicker.  To attach the car seat, you need to set the front seat back to the middle setting, taking away what would have been the back rest of the backs eat.  So, my son could not sit (and barely could stand) back there making this unit useless.  I can see it useful if you have two toddlers; however, again, if the front toddler wants to recline a bit, it takes away from the toddler in the back seat.  So, hopefully, this helps those of you debating whether or not to purchase this stroller.  Based on the ratings, my wife and I were gung ho set on purchasing this, especially since it was $30+ cheaper than everywhere else.  But, we were unpleasantly surprised.",2
Best Bottom Cloth Diapers - Snap - Orange Sherbet,"We've been using Best Bottoms for about 3 months now.  Overall, we like them a lot.  We had a small baby (&lt; 6 lbs) and couldn't use them right away, but by the time he was ~8 lbs they worked fine.  One of the straps has a snap on the outside so you can overlap them for newborns and small infants.  Very smart design.  The liners are super easy to snap in and remove.  The reason we went with these is so that we could just wash the inserts rather than the whole diaper in the case of all-in-ones (less to carry around as well).  That works well for wet diapers only, but we find that we have to wash the shell when there's a poopy one.  The poop tends to run over the edge of the insert and sometimes even gets into the leg gussets a little.  Even so, we've had very few leaks: only 2 in 3 months and both were wet only.  I feel it could have been from us not putting the diaper on quite right though.  The shells come clean and dry quickly (we don't put them in the dryer), and they've held up well so far (we wash diapers every other day).  Because there's no wetness indicator on cloth diapers, we usually just change diapers on a time schedule or until we hear a poop.  The first stage inserts without any doublers are absorbent enough for about 3 hours for our 5 month old.  The shell is super easy to snap up.  You can take these off and put another one on very quickly.  My only gripe is that I wish the waistband on the shell was stretchy in the front. We have a few bumgenius all-in-ones and those are really stretchy up front - it's a nice design.  Sometimes I feel like the diaper is too tight on one snap but too loose on the next looser one.  Nonetheless, like I said, we haven't had any major leaking problems.Finally, I just wanted to add a note to those who are hesitant about cloth diapering: don't be.  It's been great.  Sure, you have to make a pretty good investment up front, but you'll have them paid for after a few months if you factor what you'd be paying for disposable diapers.  We did it mostly for the cost savings, but also because cloth diapering is good for the baby (fewer diaper rashes), and it cuts down A TON on waste.  When we had to use disposables early on I was astonished by how much waste a small baby could generate!  And you don't have to handle dirty diapers much at all.  If we have a poopy diaper, we just toss the whole diaper (shell and insert) into a wet bag right away.  When laundry times comes, we dump all the diapers and the wet bag in the washer and start it up.  After the cold rinse cycle, I separate the shells and liners and start the wash cycle.  After a few months of cloth diapering, I find the smell of a dirty disposable diaper to be much worse than anything we've had with the cloth diapers (there's no fake baby powder smell for one).We've been happy with the Best Bottoms so far and were happy to support a company that makes their products in the USA.  Best Bottoms are a good option for those looking to cloth diaper.",5
Ubbi Steel Diaper Pail in White,"It probably deserves one star, but I'm giving it two: one for it's modern style and appearance, and one because you can use any garbage bags.Like the other low star reviews mentioned, the odor seal fell out within the first two months. That wouldn't have been such a big deal, but you can't put it back in! We almost threw it out and got something else, but with infant twins, we just didn't have the time. The odor wasn't too bad until that happened, but their room has a constant diaper smell. But the kicker is the number of ripped bags we've had. Seriously, did they not test this product with full bags?! We'll keep using it until we can find something better ... but that hopefully won't be long. Then it will put out with the diapers.",2

Kick Mats - Deluxe Car Seat Back Protectors 2 Pack - Keep Your Car Seats 100% Clean From All The Stains And Scuffmarks Left By The Kids With These Auto-Protective Seat Covers - Designed For Most Vehicles - Protect Your Investment - Lifetime Guarantee,"These were a good price.  They have held up well so far after about 6 months of use.  Sometimes the corners at the top flop over.  It is not a problem for protecting the seat, but it looks a little sloppy.  Also, on my car, the elastic that holds the bottom part tight to the seat just barely fit.  You can see it if you are looking at the front seats.  Good product, though, and reasonably priced.",4

The entire line of Baby Joggers (City Mini, City Elite) and BOB strollers have connected hoods/mesh to the back of the seat.  You can not slip it around so it will never be secure.  The company really needs to advertise that it absolutely must slip behind the back of the seat.  Most common strollers it is okay but most jogging strollers (which I think is what you use the most outside) you can not use this item.  Big disappointment.  Hope this saves someone else from the hassle.",2

"Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat, Nitron","This is the 2nd Alpha Omega Elite we've purchased.  The first is still in use and holding up great, just needed another one for my husband's car and saw they were on sale.  Anyway, I've had the first for 7 months now and have zero major complaints.  In fact the only thing I can think of that's gone ""wrong"" is that the fabric is beginning to pill a bit where the back of my son's legs rub.  This has been a very sturdy yet comfortable little seat.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I paid $165 for the first in green/black and jumped on the orange/black when Amazon had it on sale for $115.  The first is in a Subaru Forester (smallish SUV) and the 2nd will go in a Mustang.  It fits comfortably in both vehicles (forward facing).",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"When my daughter first showed an interest in using the toilet, I bought one of those cheap toppers from Walmart. After a couple months I realized that it was starting to fall apart. The handles started to come off and then the seat started to tear exposing the foam on the seat. It was really gross...Then I realized that I should of invested some money for the Baby Bjorn toilet trainer I originally wanted.My daughter was so excited to use her new toilet trainer when it came in the mail!She ripped the box open and ran to the bathroom to try it out. She loved it so much she would not get off the toilet.I really love the quality of this product.There is no tearing foam or handles that will eventually fall off, cleaning is a breeze, and it adjusts to different toilets. So it's great to take on vacations! Oh most importantly since I just had another child she can also use it in the future without it falling apart! Definitely a good investment!",5
Seat Belt Buckle Guard,This is an excellent seat belt guard.  Simple as well as effective. I use these with both my childrens fixed car seats.  We have had an incident (prior to using these) when a family member has in error disconnected the kids car seat belts instead of there own and not said anything.  I was so upset after I realized that I went straight out and tried this cover. A must have for fixed car seat saftey.  If you need to disengage the belt it's quick and simple to use your ignition key to push down against the latch.  No need to hunt for the wooden lolly sticks provided.,5

Neurosmith - Music Blocks with Mozart Music Cartridge,Recently I have purchased the musical mozart blocks set for my two and a half year old daughter at a toys r us department store near me as a Christmas gift for her this year and they had one of the toys out on display. She loved the toy and it is very educational. I had a hard time leaving the store because she wanted to continue to play with it although she is young enough that even though she was with me while I purchased her toys for Christmas this year that she had completely forgotten about it and that I haought this toy for her. My only complaint is that I had to pay [$$$] for this toy and they had told me that the sale on the toy had ended yesterday but this toy I knew was still available online here for [$$$] which is a really good price and I do not think it is right for them to sell it for the other price when it can be bought cheaper. Anyways I liked the toy alot and my daughter did too and that is why I purchased the toy even at the price I  had to pay for it. I think it will get a lot of use out of it and so will my 8 month old daughter when she is old enough as well.,5
Satin Crib Nap Pillow by Little Giraffe in Blue,"I don't know why I thought my baby needed a pillow. It's over stuffed in my opinion and all he does is toss it over the crib. It looks good, but totally not functional. Its also stuffed with what feels like polyester, so not very plush.. there is not way he could snuggle up to it. He either sucks on the edges or tosses it over the crib. Not worth buying in my opinion, but love the blankets for sure.",2
Cloud b Sleep Sheep On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds,"My husband and I are VERY happy with this sheep. The size is perfect for the crib and to travel with (I wouldn't want the bigger size). The sounds are all very soothing. Our child likes the stream and rain sounds best....probably because they are constant. The whale and waves are nice too, though if your baby wakes easily the crashing of the waves or the sudden whale song may wake him or her up, otherwise they are pleasant.The sound has two timer settings, one for 45 min and one or 23 min(the bigger size only has 23 min). We use the 45 min setting most of the time and find that it is more than enough time to help our little one settle and fall asleep. Others complain that the sound doesn't stay on all night, but that's not what this product is created for, so if that's what you want I suggest you look elsewhere.Not only does our daughter love the sounds the sheep makes, but she also enjoys talking to it and batting at it in the morning when she first wakes up. The Velcro is VERY strong so I have never been worried about it falling into the crib.We got this sheep just before my daughter was born and after 6 months of daily use the sound became severely distorted. I sent an e-mail to Cloud b consumer service letting them know about this problem and within 24 hrs I got an e-mail back saying they were shipping me a new sound box. I got the box in the mail a few days later. Other than the issue with the sound box (which was fixed very quickly) I have loved this sheep and would recommend it to any parent!",4
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count","I heard that Diaper Genies are great...until you have to empty them.  So instead, I opted to buy these scented sacks and have had no regrets!  They are surprisingly large enough to fit 4-5 wet diapers (size 3) so I just tie the ties once to keep whatever odor in and stuff it till it's full.  If the diaper is really stinky, I just use one sack, tie it tight and toss it in the nursery trash can.  The odor is contained and very minimal if anything.  The great thing is, you can pack some of these sacks in your diaper bag to take with you, too...just in case.",5

2 Inch Foam Bassinet Mattress - 16&quot; x 32&quot; x 2&quot;,"i so wanted to love this because it took me forever to find a mattress to substitute the pathetic, flimsy one that came with our simmons glide bassinet.  found this finally and it took quite a while to receive it, i'm spoiled by my usual prime shipping, but there wasn't that option with this purchaseany ways, the most important thing, is that IF you buy this, words of high recommendation, you MUST air it out and/or cover it with something else.  it has the most chemical smell to it and even after airing it out overnight outside, our daughter's bassinet smelled and i was appalled thinking this is for a baby and it still smells.NOTE:  my remedy was i wrapped it tightly in plastic seal several times to contain the smell, it was still not going away after washing it with non toxic cleaner and further airing it out.  the seal seemed to do the trick pretty well... have to say i was impressed with my idea.  ;)  but it seriously saved the situation.  i can't imagine that the smell was non toxic to a baby",2

Crisp &amp; Clear Plus Rechargeable 900MHz Monitor,"The positive: The monitor is certainly sensitive. I could hear my son's breathing and little sighs easily with the monitor on 4.The negatives: There was static from the thing--always. Also, on random nights we would hear odd little blips about 2 seconds apart. Did I try turning off appliances, etc.? Yes. Did I move the monitor to different locations? Yep. In addition to being curious about what was causing these sounds, I never could figure out the reason why the blip happened on some nights and not on others.Also, I recently discovered that if I changed the channel my husband and I were treated to the goings-on of little ""Jackie"" and his parents, who apparently live somewhere in our neighborhood. I really do hope that they weren't able to listen in to us. The final straw was the loud interference the monitor would emit when I turned on a fan in my son's room. Again, this was a recent discovery.I returned the thing today and bought a Graco model. So far, so good.",2

"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear","I initially bought two sets of the 2-oz cubes, and since then, I have bought two more. These work great for my homemade baby food purees. I don't make huge batches of food at a time, but I find that 6 cubes hold exactly the same amount that fits in my Baby Brezza. I fill the containers, let them cool, put on the lids, and stick the tray in the freezer. Each evening, I take three cubes out of the freezer and put them into the fridge for baby's meals the next day. The lids seal wonderfully and they pop off just as easily. The plastic is very high quality and stands up to the different temperatures. I haven't had any trouble with staining either, even with sweet potato or carrot. I'll probably buy some of the 4-oz containers soon, since it seems that my daughter is ready for more food in a serving, but these have been a great investment.",5

Fisher-Price Sensory Selections Bouncer,"I really hated the look of this product when I put in on my registry, but all the choices seemed ugly and this did seem to have good features.  Looks aside, my child loves the chair.  As a newborn, the vibration feature was great and he found it very soothing when agitated. He seemed very comfortable to fall asleep in it. Now that he is 3 months, he will just stare at the bumble bee and smile and coo.  He does look up at the thing above.  I think sometimes he is looking at his reflection in the mirror and othertimes I think he is watching it spin.  I do wish the music would play longer because sometimes he reacts when it stops and he is not old enough for the feature where they turn on when something is touched.  All in all, I think it was worth the money.",5

Peg Perego Primo Viaggio Car Seat / Infant Carrier with LATCH Base - Chesapeake,"I bought the Atlantico travel system while still pregnant on a great sale, and it came with the Primo Viaggio car seat(not the latch version though!). I love the stroller, but cannot say the same about the car seat. It is heavier than some other cheaper and just as safe brands on the market, and the plastic attachment that secure both straps together is not very practical - you have to pull both straps together to fasten it, which bothers my baby very much. I had my baby in the fall, so I cannot say a word about tha fabric being too warm. Even knowing he is only 6 weeks old, I can already say he will outgrow this car seat pretty fast. Another downside: we will be flying internationally in 2 months and I just found out I cannot attach the car seat to the airplane seat without the  base. It will be a hassle to carry the stroller+car seat+base on our trip!!! The Graco one can be attached safelly without the bulky base.On the good side, my son seems to enjoy his car seat for now, and the fabric is beautiful.If I had known then what I know now, I would have bought the Graco car seat and the universal car seat attachment to attach it to the Atlantico stroller.Just one remark about the Atlantico stroller: I read in one of the reviews a complain about the stroller's plastic attachment - first of all it is not suppose to stay attached to the stroller with your child in it - it's only purpose is to keep the 5 point harness still while you fasten your child to it, then you are suppose to pull it out. It's on the instructions though.",3

I ended up having a c-section, and did not use them at that time, although I know they would have feltWonderful. I did, however, need them a few months later while recovering from hemorrhoid surgery. They freeze quickly, and unfortunately seem to thaw pretty quickly as well. Since there are 2, it's easy enough to just rotate them. It's relief when you need it. I've also used them on my eyes. The gel feels wonderful, and it's the same as the gel masks they sell. The gauze covers keep them from sliding, so use them wisely.",5

Diaper Genie 3pack Refill,"During the first few weeks it isn't really so necessary to have or to use the genie, being that most diapers are wet and have no smell. Then God comes in and boy, oh boy, you know that the diapers need all the prayers they can get!! Ours was answered by getting this Diaper Genie.I believe that for our family the convenience far more outweighs the cost.  Yes, each refill can cost from $4-$6, however, the fact that we have 2 dogs who can't try to wet their appetite from an ""icky pooh"" diddy is just one of many extras for us. We recycle so our kitchen trash isn't emptied as often and is not filled with the stench from a baby trying new foods. The toddler refills are more effective than the beginners at hiding smells. And after a few refill changes its quick and easy to change the refills. We are extremely happy with our purchase of this genie and would highly recommend it for those of you who need the convenience of a  quick change.. If so- This is definitely the pail for you!!However, if we had 2 children in diapers it would be a very different story because of the amount of diapers each day would increase and the refills would not last as long as they do for our 1.  Not nearly cost effective enough for that. I do wish they made bulk pack refills at discounted prices for the amount you can go though. As well as covers in different shades and prints so the genie wouldn't be so obvious. Even so, This was definitely worth our pick.  And we have gotten our moneys worth.",4
"NUK/Gerber Seal N Go Disposible Liner, 50-Count","The bags that my insurance supplies for free with my pump only hold 5oz which is not enough when you have to pump exclusively.

Evenflo X Sport Plus Convenience Stroller - Christina,"I have two daughters, 3 and 16 months.  I have a nice double stroller but it's just too big to use in some places and it's also a little time consuming because I have to set it up and strap both kids in when all I want to do is quickly do my errands.  This stroller works great and suits its purpose.  I'm an Army wife, who like thousands of others, has to do a lot of things on my own when their husbands are deployed. I'm on my 3rd deployment and although I can do a lot of things without needing help, I do welcome a break whenever I can get one...lol.  Juggling two active little ones when I have to do errands can be really challenging at times.  I had it down to a science before, but my 16 month old is really getting too big to carry and try to hold onto my 3 year old as well, like when we go to the store, daycare or where ever I have to go that day.  So I really like this stroller and so do my kids.  It's easy to maneuver and set up.  The lever is on the bottom and sometimes I can push it with my foot to fold the stroller again.  Most times I have to use my hand though.  But I wouldn't call that an inconvience at all.  It folds up nicely, the handles are comfortable, it's lightweight and it has nice pockets for smaller items.  The only reason I could think of for not giving this stroller 5 stars was it's not completely hands-free.  But, to me, that's a small price to pay for a nice stroller and I've gotten several compliments on it.  I'd definitely buy this one again.",4
Fisher-Price My Little Snugabunny Ultra Comfort Musical Gym,"We purchased this from a local store and when we got it home the connecting electronic hub would work only for a few seconds when turned on before quitting. We called Fisher Price directly and they were good about sending us a prompt replacement hub. But...when we received it, the second one wouldn't work either! Just got off the phone with them for the second time and they are sending us a voucher for the MSRP of the item which is lovely. But in the meantime we have to wait for them to revieve the mat via snail mail before they will  sent the coupon and our little one had to go without entertainment :(",2
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","I like the design and safety rating of this product. However, I am constantly frustrated with how hard it is to tighten my daughter into the seat. I can easily loosen her from the restraints. Therefore, the safety dramatically goes done as it is usually not as tight as I would know it should be on her. I also find the I am constantly having to rethread the restraints as they get twisted very easily. Also, I own 2 of these seats and have the same complaint for both products.  My husband also has issues with getting her in the seat restraint tightly and grandma can not even do it so I needed to get a new car seat for her car and settled on a cheaper car seat called safety 1st Guide 65 sport convertible car seat and am very happy with this purchase and recommend it over the grace nautilus.",3
"Ah Goo Baby The Wipes Case, Audrey","The design is neutral and not too baby-ish.

"BooginHead SippiGrip, Pink/Green/White",My granddaughter likes to throw her sippy cup down when we are shopping. This is great for keeping it attached to the stroller or the shopping cart.

Tot Bots Easy Fit One-Piece Diaper 8-35 lbs (Three Little Piggies),"We have been using this diaper for about a month now on our 3.5 month old. It is one of my favorite clothies. The PUL fabric is nice and soft, as is the inside minky lining. The leg gussets are soft, but do a great job of keeping messy poops inside the diaper. The minky inside is surprisingly absorbent, we never have leaks with these (though there is plenty of space to add extra inserts if you wish). I love the aplix because it allows us to fit the diaper perfectly to our baby. And finally, it gives him a nice soft, cushy bum! Oh, and cute prints!The only thing that might be a downside for some folks is that the inner fabric is not natural. . . pretty sure it is made from polyester.",5

The straps are long enough to wrap around the entire car seat, which made it a little easier for us.  They were great for snacks and playing with toys.  If you want to use it as a desk, you need something hard to write on.",5
Wrapeaze Fleece Hooded Wrap 0-24 Months ~ Quick On/Off Jacket Alternative (Black &amp; Red Camo),I like this jacket/ sweater because its like a little poncho. Its not too heavy but keeps my baby warm in the cool desert winter. Very nice!!,5
Philips AVENT Drying Rack,We are very satisfied with the purchase. Drying is very comfortable and easy going. Conveniently dry bottles and teats. Five stars!,5
Peg Perego Primo Viaggio SIP Infant Car Seat in Soleo,"I purchased this for a friend directly from her baby registry.  She wanted the soleo, but received the revi black.  I called Amazon, and it took me awhile to explain it, but they agreed to ship her another one today as long as she sends the first one back.  hopefully, she will get the one she wants this time, but if this happens to you, DO NOT let them tell you you need to return it for a refund first because it is obviously their mistake.  Even more reason - this item has gone up almost $20 since I placed the original order less than a week ago.",3
"Britax Head and Body Support Pillow, Iron/Gray","I purchased this so my newborn could ride comfortably in our B-agile stroller.  It is soft and easy to put in and out.  It looks like it would wash up well too.I see a lot of people use these types of inserts in their car seats to make their babies ""more comfortable.""  Do NOT use after market inserts in your car seat.  The back of this insert says it's only supposed to be used with Britax car seats.  In other words, Britax has given you the OK to use it in a Britax car seat.  If you have another brand of seat, your manual will say that you may not use after market products because they interfere with the straps of the seat. In fact, you will never see a Chicco or Graco manual, for instance, bless the use of an insert like this.  In fact, use of after market products (i.e. products that didn't come with your seat) will void the warranty and if you get into an accident and your baby is injured because you used something like this, you are out of luck.",5
Kinderkord Child Safety Restraint System,i think i bought a newer version with rubber wristband. its actually a very safe device and would recommend this for safety-first moms like myself. better than other kids safety leashes on the market that i have been using.,5
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Diaper Cover with Hook and Loop, Aqua, Size 1","This Diaper Cover works well and is handy for its' function.  Recommended to help you with your little one!Four stars!P.S., In case you are wondering - it's being used my my first (step-) grandson!",4
Safety 1st 2 Pack Custom Fit All Purpose Strap,I had intended to use this product to hold a bathroom cabinet against the wall but it didn't work out for me.  My fault for trying to addapt it for another use.  It seems like it would work well to child-proof foors and drawers.,3
Stroller Rain Cover,"Living in the city, our only form of entertainment outside is really to just take a stroll, and this cover really helps, especially on those sunny but windy days.  I do agree with others that it's a pain to fold up, but it is do-able.  You just have to keep the creases there (from when you first open the package), but folding it the same way (like a paper bag)...then it'll come out somewhat flat.It's also nice that it fits over the stroller even with the car seat snapped in.",4
Fisher-Price Adorable Animals Baby's Bouncer,"I received this as a gift for my son. He started using it at 4 weeks, he did not like the vibrations at the time, i guess it was too heavy. However when I placed him back in it now at 4 months he absolutely loves it. He loves the zebra rattle and even seems as if he is showing off to us that he can make the toys spins. I fear that the center piece that hangs down will hit him...but so far it hasn't. He giggles and kicks when I place him in it. It allows me to get stuff done around the house...Best gift ever.",5
"MamaDoo Kids Foldable Play Yard Mattress Topper, Blue",I ordered this for our daughter when she started going to my in-laws during the day and she needed a place to nap. she used to be really fussy when we would try to get her to sleep on the regular pack n play mattress but now she really doesn't complain at all. the mattress is firm and doesn't appear to be wearing thin - we've been using it daily since april and it appears to be the same thickness. i am also happy that the mattress fits snugly in the pack n play so there's no worry about gaps and suffocation. i would definitely recommend this product.,5
"RECARO Performance SPORT Combination Harness to Booster, Vibe","We bought this for our 2 year old daughter (she turns 2 in 5 days)! I was worried since this was a booster/convertible car seat it would be too big/advanced/not secure enough (all the factors that go through our mommy brains) but the Recaro Performance Sports Booster conforms to her beautifully, she is SO secure and snug plus very very well protected with the side impact protection pads. I was also worried that the padding wouldn't be as thick because in the picture it does not look as 'thick' as the Recaro Proride car seat but let me tell you I also purchased that one for our 3 month old daughter and they are BOTH relatively the same amount of padding. I was so relieved to get them and see how beautiful the color was in real life, the pink is not so hot pink as it looks in the picture it is a nice soft pink. For the Proride we got the purple color and it is also a very nice deep purple. We had previously the Britax for our 2 yr old and In comparison to buckling and pulling the straps tight or loosening it is basically the same set up (you push down the little lever/button in the same spot on front of car seat just like the britax) but I would have to say the Recaro feels smoother to me. They are virtually the same in the aspect of getting them buckled but it feels easier to do so. In comparison to the Sport and Proride the only major difference I see which may be a factor for you is the strap protection piece for there neck is sewn into or part of the straps on the Sport seat and are removable on the Proride just like the Britax ones.Overall I was trying to debate whether or not to get the Sport or two of the Proride car seats for both of our daughters but I am so happy I chose to get her this Sport booster one for my 2 year old as it conforms to her perfect, she's comfortable and well protected PLUS she can grow with it! And by the time she is out of this, we can move our baby into this one... But that won't be a long ways down the road. I particularly love that these are higher then other car seats as we are not short people. I am 5'9 and my husband is 6'2 so our kids have always been in the 80-90th percentile for height! Happy car seat shopping, you won't be disappointed by this purchase!!! :)",5
26-Piece Foam Puzzle Play Mat - Solid Colored,"It is perfect for what I wanted. Nice and thick to make playing on hardwood floors safer. The colors aren't adult-friendly, but who cares, they keep my baby from hitting his head on a hard floor. They protect the floors from his toys as well. We put three sets in for a birthday party and no one got hurt :)",5
2-in-1 Professional Clinical RY210 Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead and Surface,I like this thermometer because is easy to handle and is very accurate. I don't need to touch the forehead so the patient doesn't feel nothing. it's fast and I can see the temperature in an easy way as it shows in the back of the item. I would recommend it.,5
North States Supergate Wire Mesh Gate,This is a great gate and simple to use.  The one thing that could improve it are a bit more detailed instructions for first time use.  I had to compare the picture to the wording printed on the product itself to determine correct placement.  Once in place though it is very secure.,4
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,"**UPDATE**I've gotten a lot of use out of these pouches now!  I always put them in the dishwasher and they usually come clean.  However, there are times that stuff gets stuck along the bottom and I have to use a nipple cleaner to get it out.  So, they are dishwasher safe, but that doesn't mean the dishwasher will always get all the stuff out.  Just check them when they come out!**Original Review**I've had my little green pouches for about 5 days, and I've put them through the dishwasher 2-3 times now.  They seem to come clean easy, I just rinse out the majority of the stuff before I put them in the dishwasher.  The caps come out clean too.  They hold two containers of baby food.  I haven't had one leak yet and I've let my 16 month old play with it (he likes to squeeze and bang on it) while waiting for me to sit down and open it for him.  I do wish the cap was attached somehow.  I used a different kind of pouch (that I hated) but it did have the cap attached, which was nice.  However, I wouldn't even drop a star for that.  If anything bad goes wrong in the next few months, I'll update my review, but I don't see that happening.  These pouches are very well made.",5
Diono Radian Angle Adjuster,"The Angle Adjuster is a wonderful item, that I was originally reluctant to buy. With the use of the Angle Adjuster, the front seat passenger can put his/her seat all the way back in my small sedan, while the car seat is rearfacing directly behind. This item has allowed me to have full use of my car and continue to rearface, both of which I am thankful for! I now view this item as a necessity, as it has made such a difference.",5
Dora the Explorer Bedding Set Toddler - 4pc Jungle Flowers Comforter Set,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter and I knew it would feel stiff (from other reviews posted) so I washed it 2 times with detergent and fabric softener and it came out alot softer, but for what I paid (about $45) it could be better material. I could not find any other Dora bedding so that is why I settled for this item. The comforter is very colorful and cute, I just wish it was softer like a real comforter is. I haven't put it on her bed yet but I know she will love the colors and Dora. I am still going to look for a better quality Dora bedding set...",3
Medium - Imse Vimse Training Pants (28-37 lbs),"I purchased these thinking they were like a diaper and would prevent a mess while potty training but I was wrong. Might be my mistake but if there was an accident it made a mess everywhere, I just used regular panties instead.",3
"Evenflo SmartSteps Jump and Go, ABC123",The jumper continually spins around where we keep it in the doorway. I would buy a floor jumper if I were to purchase again.,2
"Regalo My Chair Portable Chair, Royal",This is such a easy to use booster seat and is awesome for the travel trailer as it can be used outside arround the fire and then on the bench seat for dinner! The only negative I have found is that the crouch strap in the center is too short so we just dont buckle our 2 yr old in.,5
ReSqueeze Reusable Food Pouch (8-pack),"I have been exceptionally happy with resqueeze pouches. They are easy to fill, easy to clean, and kiddos love them. I have used them myself for lunches and for kiddos I watch during the day. They love them and keep asking me for more. The price is unbeatable. I have seen similar products and you only get two for 20 bucks. 8 pouches for 25 is a steal. You can't go wrong with resqueeze.",5
Sassy Crib and Floor Mirror,"Our little boy loves to stare at himself in the mirror.This mirror is made from safety glass and is a big size.It will sit on the floor on its own and the wings of the bumble bee are crunchy when touched...so the baby like reaching for the wings to make noise.Only drawback is that I wish it attached to the top of his activity mat.There are velcro straps to attach to the side of a crib, but they don't hold the mirror up on if you want to hang it from the top of the activity mat.I am still happy with the purchase and the price is nice",4
"Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Black","I got this bag for traveling since it has so many pockets.  We just took it on a trip and it was great.  I love the pockets on the front to easily get something or put something in, like a toy or pacifier.  The side mesh holder was able to hold my sons two handled sippy cup and the cell phone pocket is awesome.  I like the two pockets on the top of the bag.  These aren't the kind you see on other bags.  I was able to put diapers right there and get at them easily without having to dig in the bag.  I also like the magnetic closures.  I previously had the Spark by Skip Hop from Target, which is also a good bag but I didn't like the velcro because blankets and things would snag on it.I love that you can carry this by one strap unlike the Spark with two straps and the way this attaches to a stroller is awesome!  We kept it attached to our umbrella stroller for our trip and it worked great.  When I first bought this my husband said, ""oh no...another diaper bag"" but after this trip he said ""that was a really good buy; it worked out great for our trip""This is a good bag for traveling or everyday use depending on how much stuff you like to bring. I alternate between this one and my Petunia Pickle Bottom bag, which is more for style rather than this one is more practical but still very cute.I gave it 4 stars because when you do have stuff in the inside pockets it puffs out towards the inside making it a little hard to see or fit other stuff in there.  The changing pad is a great size, but once your bag is full it's a little hard to get in and out of the back pocket (I find this to be true with most bags though).  Overall I would say it's a very good bag and I would recommend it to a friend.",4
Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,"My infant son was an incredible sleeper as a newborn. We counted ourselves as blessed until he hit 3 months. The night before I went back to work, he learned how to break out of his swaddles. He woke us up at 1 am, 3 am, 4:30 (with the swaddle blankets over his face) and finally 6 to eat and be up for the day.  Each time I'd have to re-swaddle, calm him down, and get him back asleep. I was exhausted (and nervous about suffocation)!  This kept up for 3 weeks until I ordered this sleepsuit. He began sleeping from 8-5:30 am without a peep again since the first night!In short, it helped him eliminate that startle reflex and recreates the sensation of the swaddle. We were nervous about him overheating based on the reviews (he sweats a lot!), but it hasn't been a problem at all.Also, an unintended bonus--it works with the car seat. We put him in it last night, and he fell asleep on our way to a cookout. He stayed asleep the whole time. Before, we hated to take him anywhere after 8 because he would wake up getting un-swaddled for the car seat.",5
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","I love this bag! It's super sturdy and well made. My mother sews and so I know what good seams look like. This looks like it is made with care and stands up to (occasionally) being tossed down the stairs when I am carrying, say, the baby, the garbage and a load of laundry in the bag and need to free up a hand. It washes beautifully, contains the smell and the wet, and I'm sure we'll be using it at the beach long after baby is out of diapers!",5
Fun Time 5053 Pre-School Fun Play Push Along Tool Truck,"If you didn't have to destroy the packaging to get it out we would have sent this back.  It is cheap in quality and has not interested him in the least.  I think $5.00 would be a bit much to pay for it as this seems rather """"dollar store"""" in quality.  What a disappointment.",1
FuzziBunz Perfect Size Cloth Diaper - Spearmint (Medium),there is no elastic around the top at all which makes it really comfortable but a little leaky. Also I like the snaps because then you avoid that annoying baby velcro that gets stuck on everything but the snaps do take a little longer and my husband never gets it right.,3
"Britax Boulevard 70 CS Convertible Car Seat, Biscotti",Comfortable and safe.  Fits with no problem in BMW X5.  Would choose this model again.  Moved my son in this seat when he was 22lbs and 7mo.  No regrets on purchase.,5
Simple Wishes Hands Free Tie Back Breastpump Bra - (L - PLUS),"For the price paid this is great! It is really nice to have so you can double pump easily. I love how easy it is to put on and zip up in the front. The only thing I don't love is the tie back, but I can deal with it.",4
Medium - Imse Vimse Training Pants (28-37 lbs),These training pants have worked great for my two and a half daughter. Disposable training pants had put potty training completly out of her mind and with these she became aware once again about using the potty. It has been effortless. They also don't leak after one pee so I can change her if she has an accident and it is not a big deal. I really recommend this product.,4
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Hallway Security Gate, Black",It amazes me how many adults cant figure it out though.  Its not only a baby gate but a sister gate a father inlaw gate and a mother gate as well.  People seem to struggle.  I have no problem.  Pretty simple concept.  Push the button lift the gate and open. Its definately solid and I feel comfortable that its going to keep a young child where they need to be because its adult proof as well lol.Works pretty well for the dog also.,4
"Lamaze Cloth Book, Panda's Pals","I saw these books and thought that my daughter would love them--she just turned 1 year old, and loves &#34;reading&#34; them and turning the pages herself. She never reads this one, the story is cute, but the pictures could be way more interesting. For example, they talk about the shiny scales on a fish, but in the book the color is drab--could they not add shiny fabric to the fish on the page?I may be super picky, but she has a lot of books that she loves and this one was disappointing...",3
Kids Preferred Classic Pooh Flat Blankie Teether Toy,I absolutely adore this.  It is so soft and cute.  I just know my new little one is going to love it.,5
"Diono Trio Cup Holder, Black",Great it.  Easy to clean.,5
Bumkins Waterproof Art Smock - Dr. Seuss Cat In The Hat,"Good fit for my 2-year-old, who's on the small side. My only concern wAs that this wouldn't fit her, but it did. And like any other art smock, it does its job...I'm satisfied that my daughter puts this smock to good use",5
Kick Mats - Deluxe Car Seat Back Protectors 2 Pack - Keep Your Car Seats 100% Clean From All The Stains And Scuffmarks Left By The Kids With These Auto-Protective Seat Covers - Designed For Most Vehicles - Protect Your Investment - Lifetime Guarantee,I have a rambunctious toddler who love to kick the back. This protects my car. I only wish there is something to protect the headrest--he can reach that high!,5
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty",I have an older car that doesn't have the latch out of the seats.  I could never get my car seat as tight as it needs to be.  This car seat was made to work with older cars.  It has latches on the side that prevents the seat belt from loosening.  It is a big car seat for rear facing but I know it is built for safety.  It also has the latch for newer cars.  So when we buy a new car we can use the more updated belt.Also this is my third car seat for my child who is still under 1 year old.  Don't waste money on the others.  This is the best car seat by far.,5
ZPS Cute Baby Flower Cotton Cap (Pink),I got this in the mail and its adorable my fianc&eacute; says the flower looks to big but I disagree I think the hat is so cute and the fabric feels soft for a babies sensitive head.,5
Munchkin Click Lock Fresh Food Freezer Pops,I got these for when my son was teething as he wouldn't suck on a teething ring. These were a hit. I would dilute apple juice with water in a cup and then pour it in. Home made pops without tons of sugar. Perfect size for little hands. He is 21m and he sometimes eats two at a time depending on how hot the day is.,5
Safety 1st 2 Pack Custom Fit All Purpose Strap,We got these once the little genius learned how to open the drawers containing the A/V equipment and DVDs. They've been in place a year and she still hasn't been able to figure them out. I barely notice them anymore but initially found the white quite garish on our espresso-colored TV stand. More color options and removable adhesive and they would be a 5.,4
"Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep","Not too bad, soft and plush, but sounds are pretty muddy.  Overall, it does it's job and gives our little once something cute to look at!",4
Baby Einstein ABC Diaper Bag,The bag was exactly like the picture - but I found that it was difficult to hang it on my son's pram.,3
Munchkin Five Multi Cups,"My children like these because they are colorful and fun.  I like them because they are easy to clean. They are all one piece with no crack or crevasses and are made from nice plastic that stuff comes out of easily; plus the dish cloth fits right in them.  They stack really nicely, too. I thought they would be a little juvenile for my 6 and 8 year old, but they like them as much as my 4 and 2 year old.",5
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"When I learned that there were WASHABLE nursing pads, I was excited! I tend to go through nursing pads pretty quickly. These are comfortable, even when saturated...so comfortable, that I hadn't noticed that they were saturated and leaked everywhere! To combat that, I ended up backing the washable nursing pads up with a disposable pad. I go through a lot less nursing pads now! Because of this, I am now going through 1 washable pad about every other day and have to change the disposables even less often. FYI: When washing these, they tend to fold themselves up in the dryer, but they smooth back out easily with wear.Some people may notice that this is the same review as the Lansinoh Washable Nursing Pads, 8 ct. That is because I used these two brands of nursing pads together.I didn't really like the small washing bag that came with these Medela pads. There wasn't much room to put more than 4 pads in it. I think a bigger bag should come in it because there is no way the pads can be clean with them so stuck together.",4
Tommee Tippee Travel Bottle and Food Warmer,"This works just like you would expect!  I even tried an experiment where I filled it up at night, went to bed and about 8 hours later I used it to warm up a bottle.  The water came out steaming and did the job!  Why don't they make a Thermos this good?I highly recommend this product, just be careful with the boiling water!",5
Graco Direct Connect Digital Baby Monitor with 2 Parent Units,"I would absolutely NOT recommend this monitor.  As other reviewers have noted, the signal drops randomly and without warning.  To get it to work again (if you realize it has happened), you have to go to the base, turn it off and turn it back on.  Personally, I don't enjoy sneaking into my son's room while he is sleeping to do this.  At other times, I have been sleeping myself and awoke to him crying - for who knows how long.  This has been very disturbing and frustrating.  Also, I don't particularly like the blue colored night-light on the monitor base.  I'm sure there are other monitors out there that work more consistently - don't buy this one.",1
"Foundations Serenity Safereach Compact Crib, Clearview, Natural, 0-36 Months",I am so glad we chose the fold down side beds.  It is easy to put a sleeping baby in the bed because we don't have to reach way down.These beds are sturdy and look great.Remember not to leave the sides down if you have babies that pull up.  They can squish a finger if they reach up and mess with the folding side.,5
"Munchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Vary",I put frozen fruit in these things when my baby is teething or fussy and it works like a charm. They are easy to clean and amazing!,5
Evenflo Summit Easy Walk-Thru Gate,"I was looking for a walk through pet gate to keep my pug boys corralled in the kitchen. We had been using a pressure mounted walk over baby gate, but after a couple of falls decided we needed an upgrade. Initially I purchased another brand of gate at twice the price, but decided on a whim to give the Evenflo a go despite its less than 5 star ratings by several buyers. Boy, am I glad I did. Went up in a matter of minutes and is very secure. The metal bars prevent my dogs from jumping up on the gate and knocking it out of place. Easy open and close. Needless to say a took the expensive doggie gate back. The ONLY drawback to this gate is it is too high for my 8 year old (slightly overweight) cat to jump over. There just isn't anything for him to jump onto and spring off of to get over. Fortunately he has another way through the house, but we want to put another walk through gate up and he would have to be able to get over it to get to his food and box.  Guess we'll have to look for something else but I would purchase this again in a  heartbeat.",5
Child to Cherish Nest Egg - Blue,Beautiful gift for a baby boy or girl.  Just the right size - not too big nor too small.  Well packaged and fast shipping.,5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","Me and my wife bought the moby and it was great. My little girl was comfortable, so comfortable that she did not fuss. I had here in there for hours and she actually went to sleep in it. The wrap does not put any stress on one area of your body. It distrubutes the weight of the baby. OUTSTANDING PRODUCT.",5
Bassinet Essentials Kit 5 Piece Set Includes :,"I ordered this set because I cannot find a mattress that fits snugly in my Summer Infant Soothe 'n Sleep Carter's Bassinet.  I contacted the manufacturer and they told me the only one that does fit is this specific mattress set.  It doesn't fit at all, not even close.  Their own product tag says maximum of 1/2"" space between the edge of the mattress and the bassinet sides.  They apparently don't follow that recommendation, however, because I can literally fit four fingers in the gaps on both sides and two fingers on the ends.Also, the crease where the mattress is folded for packaging is irreversible.  It says 'firm' but is very, very soft and flimsy.  This is going back ASAP and I will have to buy another bassinet, one that uses a standard size.  Thankfully the bassinet was a hand-me-down, so I didn't spend money on the bassinet itself, but I will not be purchasing anything else made by Summer Infant since their products are not made to standard sizes, and are not even made to work together.",1

Baby Aspen Baby Firefighter,"So precious can not wait to see on grandson! My son will love it, he is a firefighter and this is for his first son!",5
"Delta 2 Count Nursery Organizer Bin Set , Beige","Got these today, and they are alright, they are not quite as nice as they look in the picture.They are little material and cardboard bins that fold out, and they have pink material inserts with cardboard separators that go in the bins to create the sections.Could just be mine but my inserts do not really fit properly, but in the end the job gets done. I suppose having the removable inserts is nice if anything spills in there.They are alright but keep in mind you get what you pay for and they are only $9. I will use them, but am keeping my eye out for something a bit sturdier.",3
WubbaNub Lamb,"My daughter kept spitting out her binky and would cry after a few moments without it.  The wubbanub helps the binky to stay in her mouth, and she loves cuddling with the little lamb.  Awesome product!",5
"phil&amp;teds Navigator Buggy Stroller, Cherry","I just recently bought the navigator in single mode and just adore it! I have a 11mth oldand she looks so comfortable in it. I have previously wasted my time with a childcare discovery pram (target $170) and a bebe care rverse (original model) and neither of them met my expectations. I have learnt that you need to spend a decent amount of money if you want a diverse stroller.I am so impressed with the navigator i love the all terrain air filled tyres it feels like your floating when pushing. This is the miatake i have made before getting crappy shopping centre wheels the you cant walk anywhere else with comfortably!The follow the sun hood is awesome and the pockets in the side of the hood are sturdier than i thought and could hold bits and pieces well.The basket is larger than i thought but do realise that the second seat will use that space up with the doubles kit. That does not bother me at all because phil and teds have great accessories such as the mini diddie bag that attaches to the back of either seats, the saddle bags that attach to the side of the pram and the hang bag that attached to the handle like a waist bag.I am looking forward to using this in doubles mode.The dpuble kit also reclines unlike other models so will be great for an infant after a few weeks of months. And usimg the flat mode with double kit on top with be pefect.The seat adjustment is a bit fiddly but not a deal breaker just takes getting used to it.I would buy this pram over and over again. Meets all my needs 5 stars!",5
"Stork Craft Venetian 4-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, Cherry","I have a 5 month old little boy and I bought this for his room. Let me say the pictures does not do this crib justice. Plus its huge!!! My husband was out of town and I put this together, yes me. A blonde who cant even walk without running into walls. The only hard part was getting my 4 year old to help me hold it up. The base is heavy so may need help. This crib is not cheap and it very sturdy.",5
Skip Hop Turtle Island Play Set Bath Toy,"Definitely the most interactive bath toy I've bought. I can easily clean my daughter without her squirming, which makes bath time a lot easier. The cute little puzzle stays a-float and the squirting turtles are adorable. I also bought another set of skip hop's bath squirters to go with it so she has some variety.",5
"Combi Cocorro Lightweight Convertible Car Seat, Cool Mint","I have the pink version for my daughter and I have been just so pleased with how it is has held up with 2 years of constant use that I purchased the blue for my son when we transition him soon.  This car seat is so much more compact than other models that I have seen.  It comes in great, simple colors.  The cover comes off easily to wash.  It is very comfortable for my daughter.  The buckling mechanism is as easy as any car seat I have used.  Easy to install.  What else should I say?  I love it!!",5
"Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep","I love this product but I should state that, for my baby, this product soothes him circumstantially. While he is fully awake it makes no difference, which you kinda expect in a baby soothing product. However, when he is tired or sleeping, this product is simply amazing. It puts him quickly to bed by himself (quite a feat since I have one of those ever amazing ""will only sleep when held"" babies, he wakes up when he is put down as well so I can't allow him to fall asleep there then move him to his crib). Once he is asleep this allows him to maintain a deep, calm sleep. He rarely startles himself awake. When I am ready to go to bed I find that it even helps me fall asleep. Not to mention it's cute as can be! Overall a great and I would recommend buying or giving to any baby.",5
"Disney 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set, Taking The Race",Bought this for my 2 year old son and he loves it! My 3 year.old has been upset and wants on also. Bright colors and great quality. Great price on Amazon!,5

Wean Green Lunch Bowl 13oz/400ml Food Glass Containers - Multi Color Garden (Set of 4),these bowls are 6 oz rather than 14 and therefore it makes them completely unusable for most of the items.  It is like a small cup,1
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Pink",This is a must-have for trips to restaurants. It is very easy to clean and made of a durable silicone material. I also love the flap that catches food that my 13 month old drops. It really helps with clean up. My only problem is sometimes the suction cups don't work well. It comes in the box folded up and you really have to get the folds out in order for the tray to stay flat on the table.,4
Carbon Odorless Cloth Diaper Pail Filters - 4 Pack,What a good idea to help keep the smell at bay... We are glad to have found this pail and filters,5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",These gates so easy to install and use. Very durable as we go thru our gates a million times a day (well at least it feels that way!)Love that we don't need to install any hardware in our walls so they are great to move around and take on and off when needed. We've taken them on and off multiple times in the few months that we have had them and as of now there are no marks on our walls from them.Like how well they lock closed with the red slide over the top of the top latch- very secure.,5

"Summer Infant 2 Pack Cotton Knit Swaddleme, Safari (Small/Medium)","We recently ordered this product when our little guy grew out of the small/medium.  I gave it four stars because it is extremely helpful in getting him to sleep and helping him stay asleep, due to flail reduction.  It was especially helpful on a recent trip we took, probably because it was something familiar.  It's also great that it's a two-pack because one swaddle is always needing laundered due to pee or the leakage of our little guy's best and deadliest sleep-fighting technique, the huge poopy.  (Always right after I get him swaddled, of course.)However, I couldn't give it five stars because the construction is not very sturdy.  A major seam started ripping apart on one of them about the fifth time he wore it.  I will need to sew it up.  Also, the sides of the velcro patch are pretty scratchy, and before we realized this, he actually scratched his arms up on it one night when he wiggled them into a different position.  Now I frequently do a check to make sure his hands/arms aren't in contact with that part, but it would be nice if the product couldn't injure my child in the first place.Overall, very helpful but could be improved.",4
"BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Red","My daughter is a very messy eater. She loves to try to feed herself so in the summer I just stripped her down so she wouldn't ruin her clothes. This bib works much better than I expected. She rarely gets food on herself and she loves checking the pocket for more goodies that didn't make it all the way in. I didn't think that I would like the fact that it's made out of a rigid plastic, but it makes for a really easy clean-up as I just wash it when I wash the highchair tray and leave it on the tray to dry before the next meal. I don't have to worry about extra food particles or mold in the tiny crevasse's and I don't have to worry about using a bib rack. I love it when I can just buy 1 of something and it does the job.",5

"North States Supergate Ergo Safety Gate, Ivory","We've had 2 of these gates for a few years.  It's GREAT for a temporary use once in awhile gate. We have a tri-level home, I leave the pins installed by both sets of stairs.  We store both gates in a spare bedroom so they're ready to go anytime we have a visiting baby or new puppy.Our granddaughter came to live with us for awhile as a young toddler - she READILY scaled these gates making them vary dangerous on the stairs.  I do NOT recommend these gates for youngsters who can climb.German Shepherds can readily leap over the gate - not good on stairs.  However since they are not easy to secure, unsecure, in our frequently used stairs we normally just pushed it closed without actually latching. When the dog decides he WILL get around the gate, he does.  I would NOT recommend this gate for determined pets nor high traffic openings.If you have an occasional need, in a low traffic area, and have great hand dexterity - it's a great gate that should last for years.  Otherwise I highly recommend theCardinal Gates Auto-Lock Gate, Whiteor theCardinal Gates Stairway Special Gate, White, which is what I have ""upgraded"" to for use in our home.",3

Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,"I originally used the Avent hand pump, but I realized after 2 months that I had to get an electric pump because my hand hurt and it took too long to pump.  I absolutely love this pump.  I accidentally sat on one of the tubes and it caused a piece to break off of the plug, but it still keeps suction and I haven't had to replace it.  I will with the next baby though.  It's relatively quiet for an electric pump too.  The bag is cute and discreet so I never feel awkward carrying it.  I would recommend buying the steam cleaning bags too -- they'll save you a lot of time.  I really think that this pump made it possible for me to return to work and continue to nurse.  Well worth the money, especially if you plan to have another baby in the future.  Don't forget to buy the car adapter as well!",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These are the best bottles.  I have a four-month old son who was exclusively breastfed until he went to daycare a month ago.  He had no problems making the transition from breast to bottle, especially since the bottles contain breastmilk.  My husband had the same leaking problem mentioned by others, but it's not the bottles.  He was simply overtightening the top of the bottles.  Avent addresses this issue on their website;""Why does my reusable AVENT Bottle sometimes leak?Leaking from underneath the locking ring of the AVENT Bottle most often occurs when the 'skirt' in the base of the AVENT teat is not in the correct position. Try the following steps:Pull the teat through the locking ring until it clicks into place. Then put the dome cap firmly on to the locking ring. Screw the assembled top section onto the bottle.Check that the top section has not been over-tightened. This can distort or trap the anti-colic skirt which will not allow the proper operation of the one-way valve.Wet the base of the teat before pulling the teat through the locking ring. This will ensure that the skirt will slip easily into place inside the neck of the bottle and form a seal.""",5

Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"If you are expecting a child, go out and buy this bouncer (if you haven't already). My daughter loves this bouncer, I started putting her in it at 3 months (there really is no support for a newborn's unstable head)and she was amazed at the bright lights, songs and vibrating seat. She kickes at the toys with her feet and then lets them fall down on the bouncer and it rewards her by playing a song. I love this bouncer and don't know what I would do without it, I can get my housework done and she is highly entertained and learning at the same time!",5
"The Shower Hug for Pregnant and Nursing Moms., X/S, White with Petal Pink Trim","I purchased the Shower Hug for my daughter when she was pregnant and she started using immediately even before her baby came. She said that her breasts were already sore and tender, so the Shower Hug came in handy for her. She also raved about it for breast feeding her little one. I am glad that I could buy a useful present for mom, since sometimes the baby gets all the presents! I highly recommend this for a shower gift.Belmama and Cherub The Shower Hug, Petal Pink Trim, Small/ Medium",5
Zooper Hook-On Chair Navy Blue,"I bought this chair because a different reviewer said it cleared her 4"" table skirt with no problem.  As I also have a 4"" table skirt, I ordered this chair.  It didn't even come close to clearing our table skirt.  I was very disappointed.  Otherwise, it looks like a great chair.",1
"Badger Basket Embassy Wood Baby High Chair with Tray, Espresso",The tray is nice. the seat is hard to get the child in and out of because the tray doesn't move. The straps are worthless. not long enough to fit and the glides for the straps when the child puls they strap they come right out. I would never use it for a small child under 1 year. It needs at minimum a strap between the legs that snaps into place so they can't slide down and out. I am going to make something with a tool box myself but at this kind of money should not have to.,3
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"I purchased this play yard after being happy with Regalo's other gates.  The gate is metal and therefore very sturdy, but you should be aware that the hinges are plastic.  In fact, I received mine from Amazon with a broken hinge, however after calling Regalo support, they were very prompt in mailing a replacement part after sending them the necessary information via e-mail.",4
"My Brest Friend Twins Plus Deluxe Nursing Pillow, Green, 0-12 Months","My twins were able to fit football style for only about 1 month.  They were able to kick the chair behind once they grew a just a little so latching became difficult.  I was able to do one at a time.  Also, the sides near the back of the pillow (so the end nearest the chair/couch) slant down, so the pillow in front slants up.  This caused the baby's head to rest lower than the rest of the body, so I would have to prop pillows all over the place in creative ways AND lean to prevent this causing my back to ache.  The only benefit so far has been not having to support their weight with my arms.",3
Yummi Pouch (Set of 6),"I bought these thinking I'd have to wash them by hand based on other reviews.  When they are brand new, I can definitely see them being difficult to stay open in a dishwasher.  So I washed them by hand for the first several uses.  After they had seen those first several uses, they relaxed into the open position much more easily.  I just put them in the top rack and use a couple wide set prongs to prop them open.  Occasionally, there is a little bit left for me to clean out by hand, but I found it hard to get them as clean by hand as the machine gets them.  There is a little lip of plastic on the inside, right under the zip closure, that sometimes collects debris.  I actually use my nail to scrape it out while running it under water.  That might sound annoying to have to do, but I doesn't cause me to give this product any less than 5 stars.  I was tempted to get those cute animal ones, but I'm so glad I got these because they hold so much. The design of having the spout along the side has even made it so I could tuck the sides of the pouch under his stroller straps and he could suck the food out hands free.  I got two orders of these so I can always have my freezer stocked with baby food.  I use them at home all the time as well, ad it's easier to just hold the pouch for him (while I'm eating), than serve him with a spoon.  I recommend these for everyone with young kids, both for baby food and as snack pouches for toddlers.  These are the perfect baby shower gift too.",5

"Kolcraft Cloud Plus Lightweight Stroller, Fire Red","Like some of the other reviewers, I bought this stroller to use at Disney World and was very pleased with it. My three year old isn't in a stroller any more at  home, but needed this for a trip with so much walking. It was a great solution, cheaper than a rental stroller and pretty easy/compact/lightweight to fold up for buses. There was enough storage space under the stroller for the jackets, snacks, etc. that we needed to carry, and the stroller was comfortable for my daughter, even the one time she napped in it. The sun shade is large enough to be genuinely useful (you will still need lots of sunscreen on knees/legs). The only feature I didn't like was the tray, since it has to pop completely off instead of swinging back and forth for stroller entry/exit. I wound up just leaving the tray in our room and going without, and found that more convenient. There was also some visible wear on the spongy handle material after only one week of use. Overall, very happy with this purchase and would recommend it highly for a trip or for occasional use, as it is probably better priced than anything else similar - but it may not be the best option for long-term daily use.",4
"Gerber Birdseye 10 Count Flatfold Cloth Diapers, White","This product looks like cheesecloth.  I unfolded one right from the package and knew it had to go back when I could see right through the loose weave of the cloth.  I only wanted them for a nicer cleaning rag, but it won't even work for that.  I read the reviews, but thought that people may have been overreacting.  They aren't!  Do not buy this product.",1
Smart-Swaddle Muslin Wrap-3 pack (Sherbet),I really liked these swaddling clothes because they're not too hot and fun colors but after the first wash they got fuzz balls all over them.  I had to get them all off by hand but once I did the first time they seemed to stay nice and neat.,4
Snoogle Chic Total Body Pillow,"This is the first time I've ever taken he time to write a product review, but a decent night's sleep deserves it! I am 18 weeks pregnant now and had a lot of trouble learning to sleep on my side. I'd wake up with back and shoulder pain from constantly twisting muself into a pretzel in an attempt to avoid winding up on my back. This pillow cradles me perfectly so that no matter which way I turn, I'm completely supported. I tried a regular body pillow for a while and this is far superior. I'm getting better sleep now than I often did before pregnancy. I knocked off one star because it can get a little warm being competely cuddled up in the pillow, but cranking the AC helps with that.",4

It sits pretty low to the floor and this just doesn't work for them. When they sit on it, their knees are almost bent to their chins. I will say that it is a fantastic idea and it performs as delivered, just wish it was taller.",3

"Simmons Kids Beautyrest Beginnings Sleepy Whispers Ultra Deluxe 2 n 1 Crib and Toddler Mattress, Neutral",So far so good. We've had it going on 2 months now. Its so sturdy and comfy too! My 3 yr old is actually sleeping better. I did see some lose threads but it really hasnt been a problem. I think this will for sure last her till she's in a full sized bed. Wish I had bought this sooner. We're very happy with it.,5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"I purchased this monitor in November 2012, just before having my 3rd baby.  We have always used audio only monitors for our other  children, but with one of them still being young enough that I wanted to keep an ear on her too once our new baby arrived, we found ourselves looking into a 2nd system for the new baby.  I didn't want to invest a lot of money since this was going to be our last child but I knew I wanted to have the convenience of video monitoring.  I chose the Infant Optics DXR-5 after reading reviews on TONS of different brands and models of baby monitors.  The reviews for the DXR-5 were overall very positive and it just seemed like a great value for the price.The monitor, as others have stated, has a very clear display and seems well built and sturdy. The functions (volume/brightness) were easy to adjust. And overall the unit was very user friendly.  The camera unit is also very easy to adjust and maneuver to obtain the perfect view of the area you need to &#34;watch&#34;.  Overall I was very pleased with my purchase.About a week ago, my monitor started having difficulty maintaining a signal with the camera unit.  I contact customer support at Infant Optics and explained what was happening.  I received a very prompt response from Mae, a representative from the company. She outlined in very clear detail the steps I should try in order to see if it would resolve the issue.  Unfortunately, it did not fix the problem.  I contacted her a second time and let her know I was still having problems. Again, her response was very prompt, and she told me that since it was still under warranty to go ahead and send it back to the company and they would issue a new one to replace it.Here I am a week later and everything is up and running perfectly!  I actually think the image is clearer in the new unit I just received.  They must have improved the optics on them!  Overall, I am very pleased with the product but even more pleased with their company's customer service!  I can't even say enough how impressed I was with the excellence and professionalism of the representative I dealt with. It is something that is VERY rare these days!  I would, without hesitation, recommend this company and product.",4
"DaVinci Emily 3-Drawer Changer Dresser, Ebony","I've had the DaVinci Emily Changer/Dresser in Cherry for 2 years now, my husband assembled it solo in about 1.5 hours.  It's been used heavily ever since for our daughter (who doesn't always like to stay still on a changing table at almost 2).  It's held up beautifully, I think we have 1 scratch on the finish which was from baby teeth when she was teething.  The interior of the drawers is pine, but it's held up great in the high humidity of FL without any warping or cracking and we even have a humidfier on low every night in her room!  It's a great product, considering getting another for my next baby due in April!",5
"Boon Orb Bottle Warmer,Green","The warmer works beautifully. I had read the other reviews before buying and was concerned that you cannot heat the milk again before 10 minutes. Well I have never had to. Even if you need to warm another bottle, the first one would take at least 10 minutes for the baby to feed. So never encountered the need to warm a bottle less than 10 minutes from first. May be this wont be the case as she grows older but I think I know my baby..how much she can drink at each feeding.As for breastmilk, I have never warmed it with the warmer. I just feel that there is a chance of overheating.As for the vial for measuring water, it is a hassle definitely...reason for chopping off one star. But there is a way around it. If you warm the same amount of milk every time then you can just put the water in there in between feedings so that when you are warming the bottle at next feed the warmer is already loaded with water and you just pop the bottle in. After feeding, I rinse the bottle and fill the warmer at the same time. Hope this helps.",4

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Our twins are 20 months and we have used these since they could sit on their own.  We keep them in the car all the time to go out to eat.  You just can't guarentee that a restaurant will have clean high chairs available!  And those high chairs can't be placed at all tables due to size.  These boosters can go at any table.  The kids are getting big for them and we'll be sad to have to stop using them.  We don't use sippy cups so the cup holder isn't a problem-it holds quick straw cups.  Our kids never pull off the top tray-there's usually food on it!We can't say enough about how great these booster seats are!,5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My daughter got this for her first birthday today and she loves it!!  I know the newness will probably wear out eventually, but for now, it's probably her favorite thing from her birthday.  My 2 year old also loves it!

"Summer Infant ComfortMe Wearable Blanket, Sage, Small","Like many other reviewers, I like this blanket for its ability to keep little one warm especially they're ones that likes to around and kick their blankets.  When they are small it's less of an issue which is why would be great they came in larger sizes.We have used the halo, ergo, and others.  While they all have some benefits sometimes I still prefer the simplicity and ease of care and value you from a basic swaddle blanket",4
Baby Aspen Sweet Tee Three Piece Golf Layette Set in Golf Cart Packaging,"I would never have picked this out as a present, but it was on the wish list.  While it is cute, it is for newborns.

Together Tunes Soft Musical Cube by Neurosmith,I bought this for my daughter at the age of 8months. She looooves it.

I would recommend this this toy to anyone wanting something fun for a baby-toddle to play with,5
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"I purchased this item as the regular stroller does not fit in the trunk of my car, making it impossible to do any serious walking with my baby. This stroller frame was easy to put together, all the pieces snap into place, and is very compact, fitting easily into the trunk of my 2000 Mustang. The ride is smooth, and there are usually no complaints out of my little one when we are out and about. The car seat snaps easily into place, and the basket is sturdy enough to place purchases from the local farmers market. I highly recommend this stroller frame.",5

"Child Craft Camden 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Jamocha","This crib is absolutely beautiful! I was worried about purchasing it because of shipping issues that other customers have had. I decided that it was worth the risk because I could not find a solid back crib for only $200.00 anywhere else. Also this crib is sold and shipped by Amazon. So any shipping issues are not the manufacturers fault. It arrived in perfect condition only a few days after I ordered it.As for the women that was upset that she could not use her expensive bedding with this crib, bumber pads should never be used in infants&#8217; cribs, according to new guidelines released by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP). This recommendation, issued as part of an updated and expanded set of guidelines on safe sleep and SIDS prevention for babies, is the first time the AAP has officially come out against the use of crib bumpers. According to the AAP, there is no evidence that bumpers protect against injury, but they do carry a potential risk of suffocation, strangulation, or entrapment because infants lack the motor skills or strength to turn their heads should they roll into something that obstructs their breathing. -Parenting.com",5
"Kushies Flushable Biodegradable Diaper Liners, 100 Sheets",I agree with the reviewers giving 1 star.  Just had to witness my 3 week old son crying from one liner which attached itself to his little butt.  Although I thought these were good - if the diaper is only a little wet (as opposed to very wet following a pee) it has the tendency to cling to my baby's skin.  I would not recommend these - I may try some of the softer alternatives - though I may just do without.,1

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Mortimer the Moose Take Along Toy,"We love Mortimer at our house! We bought Mortimer for our son when he was 5 months old, and one year later he STILL loves Mortimer. Through a happy accident, one of his grandmothers gave him a 2nd Mortimer for Christmas last year. Morty has some terrific chewable antlers, a soft and squishy body, legs that make fun sounds, and a tail of rings to grab. During some rough teething bouts, we witnessed nearly an entire antler disappear into Gabe's mouth.Some reviewers commented on Mortimer being on the large size. When we first got Mortimer, we kept him tethered to some links on the stroller and found that our son could have fun by grabbing just a piece of the moose at a time. So yes, Morty might be a bit large for little ones to hold, but they could easily play with just a leg or an antler at a time.We now keep one in each car because Gabe loves to have Morty with him whenever he is in his carseat. We have also bought Mortimers for other little friends so they can enjoy him too!",5
"Summer Infant Plush Pals Changing Pad Cover, Green/Brown (Monkey)",In the pictures the colors look very vibrant but in reality they are more pastel. The pad is very soft and it holds up to multiple washes and stains come out very easy. It is quite thin so if your looking for a thicker cover this one is not for you but my son does not seem to mind it being thin. He loves changing time.,5
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"I was given this diaper pail at my baby shower for my first child. It keeps the smell in unless you are changing the bag. It uses regular trash bags which is so much cheaper than refills. I loved it so much, now that I have my second child, I have gotten a second to keep downstairs as well. The people who have had trouble must be doing something wrong! It's so easy to use, and my first has lasted almost 3 years! I tell all of my friends not to waste their money with other diaper pails!",5
Hevea Car Orthodontic 3+,I love these binkys and so does my 6 month old. They are super soft and very easy to wash. My son can chew on them with no worry of hurting his gums on plastic.,5

BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,We have tried a number of potties before I came across this product. The ones we purchased prior to the BabyBjorn were either uncomfortable for sitting or difficult to empty out. What I like most about this potty is the raised round support. it makes it easy to start early with the child. Our 15 month old girl uses it as her chair in the bathroom. The raised front of the bowl serves as handle for emptying as well as to prevent splashing from boys. This is a functionally designed potty in every respect.,5
Levana BABYVIEW20 Interference Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby Camera,"Works well, clear screen, limited interference, and night vision. I am very pleased with the product. The exras are great!",5
"Luvable Friends 3 Pack Assorted Sippy Cups &amp; Lids, Pink Assorted",I loved these cups when they first arrived.  A great size for my 20 month old daughter and she loves drinking from them.  They were exactly what the doctor ordered - literally since our dentist said we should be using sippy cups with no valve to teach her how to sip.  The problem is that the lids immediately started to crack on the sides.  They fit very snugly and crack when being snapped on.  About half of them have cracked and although all are still usable I am disappointed that they weren't a bit more durable.  I would still recommend this product and possibly even buy more especially since they will also be good drinking cups for my daughter once she learns to drink with no lid - I just wish they hadn't cracked.,4
"Oh Katy One Size Pocket Diaper, Berry","We have been cloth diapering my son since he was born in September 2011.  We have a dozen of these pocket diapers, as well as a bunch of pre-folds and thirsties wraps.I love these diapers.  However, if you don't know much about cloth diapering, they can be frustrating because they don't really come with good directions.  A key piece of information that we did not know is that if you use any kind of diaper rash ointment/preventative (vaseline, desitin, etc) without putting any barrier between the ointment and the diaper, you will quickly make the diaper waterproof.  This is not unique to Oh Katy, but instead unique to the fabric used to line pocket diapers generally.  This problem is easily solved by cutting up an old t-shirt and using it to line these diapers.  Also, if your diapers do become waterproofed (as ours did), you can strip them by soaking them in the washing machine with a bunch of the classic blue Dawn dish soap in hot water (probably a/b 1/4 C), then rinsing until there are no suds in the rinse cycle.Before we accidentally waterproofed the diapers, they were awesome.  My son was 8 lbs, 9 oz, and very long and skinny.  These diapers fit him great even when he was brand new.  He is now over 25 lbs, and 35 inches high, and we are still using them.  I love the many snap options that allow you to make many different sizes.  In my mind, that is one of the features that sets these apart from other pocket diapers.Another feature, that is great, is that because of the type of covering that is used, the whole diaper can go in the dryer.  SUPER helpful!  Overall, these diapers are great.  Just make sure you line them with an old t-shirt, and don't water proof them like we did!!",4
"Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Navy/Red","This is a thin nylon strap with a few snaps on it. The length of the loops that hold things or that attach to a car-seat/high-chair are not/barely adjustable, and the snaps aren't that strong, so baby can pull things loose. These straps are OK for home use, where the strap coming off does not result in loosing anything, but not for car-seats if you are concerned about loosing the attached item. They are relatively inexpensive, but they are but not nearly as secure or adjustable as Booginhead sippigrips, which we now use instead of these. A good, cheap alternative to Secure-a_toy straps: a shoelace with a clip tied to each end (we use the silver badge clips from conference name tag holders, they look like ""Office Depot Badge Clips"".) Tie the clip to the end of the shoelace, and clip the clip back to the shoelace to make a loop. Do this on both ends.",3
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",I purchased two of these on Amazon after reading some excellent reviews that were posted here. I went to Target to physically look at the product and it was just as sturdy as the Britax booster seat I had originally set out to purchase but with a much lower price tag. I was able to save $20/car seat on Amazon and didn't pay tax or shipping. Next month I'm buying two more for our second car.,5
"Million Dollar Baby Classic Ashbury 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Espresso",The crib is beautiful and really easy to put together. I did receive a broken part but the manufacturer replaced it with not hassle. I am very happy with our purchase and would recommend this crib to anyone.,5

Sassy Bathtime Pals Squirt and Float Toys,"Initially, I would have given these toys 5 stars for being so adorable and fun for my baby, especially for such a low price.  However, these toys retain water inside and there is no way to dry them out, and therefore harbor mold.  My baby would suck the water out of these toys.  It gives me chills just thinking about my baby drinking moldy water.  Please, for safety's sake, do not buy these squirters.  Keep in mind that this is probably a common problem for all squirter toys.",1
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"I haven't actually used the stroller yet, as I'm still waiting for my baby to arrive. But, I got this item as a gift and I had it put together within 10 minutes without looking at the owners' manual. It's very user-friendly.",4

"LA Baby Commercial/Restaurant Wooden High Chair, Cherry","This wooden high chair is sturdy, well made, and easy to put together.  I did find that it is too high to be used at a game table but works very well with the standard height dining table.  It is just what I needed and small enough that I can put it in the trunk of my car if I need to take it to a friend's.  The only drawback I can see is that you have to use it at a table which limits its use. If you go on outings where tables are not available, you would do better getting one with a tray.",5
The First Years Simple &amp; Secure Stair Gate,"I have 2 of these gates, one for the top and one for the bottom of my stairs.  I have had them up for 3 1/2 years, as I have 3 children 3 and under.  They are used extremely often during the day, and neither one has had a problem with the lock breaking.Another reviewier said they used the hands free gate instead. This is also a great gate (we have it blocking off one of the rooms downstairs). However, that gate is NOT DESIGNED to be placed at the top of the stairs!If you are looking for a gate for the top of stairs I would recommend this Simple & Secure gate. You can have the gate swing only one way, so if something does break you don't have to worry about your child leaning into it and falling down the stairs.  Easy to use, and only needs one hand to open.",5
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Bouncer, My Little Snugabunny",Works great! My 4 month old has figured out how to start the music :) she loves it therefore mom and dad love it!,5
"Adult Feeding Bib, Waterproof - Teal","This seemed like a perfect birthday gift for an elderly friend of mine.  Color was perfect, the idea of a folding crumb catcher seemed great!  Alas, when I opened it, I discovered that the snaps for the neck were on one side only . . . in other words,it could not be snapped! The crumb catcher snaps were so widely spaced that nearly everything that fell into the pocketwould immediately fall out of the sides.  Have already returned this to Amazon and would NOT recommend it to anyone.",1
"Skip Hop Zoo Safety Harness, Monkey","I never imagined that I would be one of those people who put a &#34;leash&#34; on their toddler but after an exhausting and frankly scary experience at the airport, I decided to try this harness. I love Skip Hop products because both moms as well as kids love them. And this harness is no different. My 18 month old loves wearing it because it is so cute and attractive and makes her feel like a 'big shot'. I don't use it that often, but in those situations where you prefer not to have a &#34;runaway&#34; baby this really does the trick. And now grandma can feel comfortable walking out doors without worrying that my very active toddler might get away from her. We even keep her sippy cup and snacks in it.",5
Cloud B Tranquil Turtle - Aqua,I purchased a second one of these for my elderly Aunt. My daughter brought hers into her room and she fell asleep (she normally has trouble sleeping and falling asleep). The next morning she talked about how nice it was and how it put her to sleep. So these are good for all ages! I will probably purchase a third one :),5
Jumbo Toy Hammock Net Organize Stuffed Animals,I like this because it holds a lot of my sons stuffed animals and gets them off floor. very nice.,4
"Baby Jogger 2012 City Mini Double Stroller, Green/Gray","I absolutely love this stroller! I had been debating and researching this one compared to the gt and a few others and this one came out on top. I was looking for one that would hold up to many walks, shopping, Disney world and travel, as well as an infant and a toddler. This one won! It's easy to maneuver, set up/fold up easily and very light weight. I was also looking for one that my son wouldn't outgrow too quickly, he is 2 and 33&#34;. This stroller will give us plenty of time as his feet don't even touch the foot rest and he has a few inches to spare for head room. My 3 month old also enjoys it. Excellent stroller!",5
Hudson Baby Plush Blanket with Satin Trim and Backing,The fuzz on the blanket comes off VERY easily.  It ends up in your baby's eyes and mouth.  Plus it is all over any item you wash it with.  I would NOT recommend and have to throw the two I bought away.,1

Evenflo Big Kid Booster Car Seat - Mercury,"Easy to assemble, light for easy change of vehicles - perfect for our 3 & a half year old!!!",5
My Brest Friend Inflatable Travel Nursing Pillow in Green Paisley,"I want so much to love this, and to write a glowing review. The original best friend pillow is the best gift you can give a new mom, and to have this inflatable version to throw in the diaper bag is perfect. However, I am on my third inflatable Brest friend pillow in the last two months, and I haven't been hard on it. So I can't say I love it and I can't really recommend it except if you use it only very very occasionally. I went on a trip to out of state and took the inflatable pillow, hoping I could leave it blown up so I wouldn't have to do a juggling act of knees and pillows and awkward positioning. It popped along one of the circular seams three days into the trip. I tried to patch it with duct tape, glue and then a bicycle patch but because of the odd angle it wouldn't take. I ordered a second pillow right before I went out of country, and that popped a week and a half into my trip. This popped in two places that were pretty easy to patch with duct tape. And then a third. Patched that too. I now am blowing up the pillow between switching sides, while it quietly whooshes to flatness while my baby is nursing. It's almost more trouble than it's worth...almost. Which is why I have a third one waiting at home for me when I get back stateside. As I said, I'm using this in the regularly intended fashion. My baby is 19 pounds, I inflate it to nurse when we're out, gently deflate it and put it back into the diaper bag. If we're home for a whole I leave it inflated. I don't blow it up to bursting. It's just a faulty design. So while I wouldn't discourage someone from getting it, I would caution not to rely on it too much if you can help it.",2

Munchkin Arm &amp; Hammer Disposable Changing Pad - 10 Pack,"I use them under the changing pad cover. They have saved me several times. If they get dirty you can just throw them out. They would also be good on the go to cover dirty changing surfaces in airports, stores etc. if you did not want to carry around a changing pad. They are sturdy enough o use multiple times.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn","I bought the HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece in Lime Animal - Newborn size - for my new granddaughter.  The minute we swaddle her, she quiets down and relaxes - it's amazing!  It's soft and cuddly and easy to use (easier than fighting with a receiving blanket!).  You can peek at the baby's diaper without unswaddling her as well, which is a nice feature.  I am ordering another one for her in NB (she is 8 pounds and there is plenty of room to grow) and a cotton model in SM for the summer weather.",5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,"The foam seems think and soft, and better than felt pads.However, the included double-sided tape is very thin and the backing is very difficult to remove. If you become impatient easily, don't buy this unless you can be sure the included tape is more like the double-side foam tape you can buy at hardware stores and home centers. I spent almost 15 mins. removing the backing from the &#34;other&#34; side after sticking the tape to the cushion.",3
"Adiri BPA Free Natural Nurser Ultimate Bottle Stage 3 Orange, Fast Flow (6+ months)","I don't say that to be insulting to those that have had trouble with it and it's not that large of a learning curve. It's a matter of reading the directions and following them. I thought it was really leaky at first but I didn't have the cap screwed on all the way, when you think it's on, try a little more and it will probably turn at bit more.Also, make sure that you press the cap on to the bottle tightly so the liquid doesn't leak into the cap.THEN when you have it on and you turn it upright and you take the cap off - let it sit for a few seconds upright before giving it to baby, then test it - I did. turn it over, it will give a few dribbles then nothing will come out.ANY bottle is going to leak if it falls down next to the baby in the car seat upside down and the babies body is pressing on the nipple, but barring that, mine is AMAZING.it's been a GODSEND helping him go between bottle and breast easily.Mine never had an issue with the nipple length. I love it, I had stage 1, 2, and we're now on 3.",5
"Thinkbaby Thinkster Straw Bottle, 9 Ounce, Natural/Orange",Our son would only drink his milk from his Thinkbaby sippy cup.  He is now 2 1/2 and we wanted him off of the bottle type nipple of the Thinkbaby sippy cup.  When we introduced the Thinkbaby straw cup he was happy to use this instead of the sippy cup for his milk.  Next stop is drinking without the straw at all.,5

"Combi Catalyst Stroller, Black","I did a lot of research before purchasing this stroller and I am very happy with my decision!!! First of all the price is great because you can not get a decent bassinet stroller for a good price anywhere.  I love the many features this stroller has.  The color that I purchased is blue and the blue online is a little brighter than the actual stroller but I like it more that way.  When I received the stroller I was surprised how small the box was.  The assembly was quick and easy.  I agree with a review from here that the instructions are incomplete and you do have to figure out some things on your own but once you do you will love it.  There are some things that I wish this stroller came along with like a bassinet cover for cold windy days and a rain cover.  I'm having a hard time trying to find a good fitting rain cover for this stroller.  The bassinet is huge, last week I went shopping and fit five gallons of water on the bottom (I probably shouldn't do that because it says not to put more than 10 pounds in the basket).  It rides really smooth and it looks like one of those expensive strollers.  a lot of the parts are plastic so I suggest to be careful with the stroller eventhough it seems to be really sturdy.  I am a tall person so I love love the telescoping handle.  Another great thing about this stroller is that in the bassinet mode you can actually incline a little so that the baby doesn't lay totally flat which is how I keep it all the time and it is good for babies with reflux. The stroller is also a perfect width because my doorway to the building is narrow and I get through it with no problem. Anyone thinking about buying this stroller, go for it!! I highly recommend it!",5
Mumsy Goose Monthly Baby Stickers Gender Neutral 1-12 Months,The stickers are very cute and good quality. They are the perfect size for super cute pictures with the baby.,4
"Munchkin Click Lock 2 Count Trainer Cup, 7 ounce",I originally bought the pink cup for my daughter just to try it out. After doing away with her bottles the &#34;pink cup&#34; is her favorite. I decided to buy more so she could have more cups. At first she didn't like it (because it wasn't her favorite cup) but now shes loves them both. I highly recommend to Moms trying out sippy cups for their children I love it and definately will buy more.Dominique L.,5

NoJo Jungle Tales 6 Piece Crib Set,"I've been using this crib set for over a year and it has held up great.  The material is so soft.  My son loves the animals on the quilt. We had it hanging over his changing table and he loved to look at and touch the animals.  In fact he loved touching it so much I had to take it down because he kept pulling it down. It now hangs over the back of his crib.  I love the different textures of fabrics that each animal is made from.  Most other crib sets I looked at did not have the quality of fabric that this one has.  My son also has a lot of Dr. Seuss decor in his room and the fun colors, quirky animals and circles fit well with the Dr. Seuss theme.  I call it his Dr. Seuss jungle room.",5
PRIMO Infant Bath Seat (White),"This is the BEST infant bath seat around!  We live in a small apartment and really needed a bath seat/tub that was compact and easy to store.  We first had the Puj Tub, which seemed like a great solution, but it was actually too SMALL for our sinks.  It came unsnapped as soon as we placed our baby in it because it wasn't fully supported all around.  Then, I was over at a friend's house one night and saw that she was bathing her 6 month old son in this infant bath seat.  I was amazed at how small it was, but how well-supported and comfortable her (hefty) baby boy was in it!  And then, when I found it on-line, I was even more amazed by the inexpensive price tag compared to all of the other tubs on the market.  I immediately bought it and haven't looked back!  It fits perfectly in our single basin kitchen sink (although we have to position it along the diagonal of the sink).  Our son loved the seat from the beginning.  He sits in it without any complaint.  We now have to put it in our bath tub, though, because our son is really long and didn't like having his legs scrunched up inside the sink (this is an issue with bathing him in the SINK, not with the bath seat).  The bath seat has suction cups on the bottom, so the seat doesn't shift around in the bath tub while he kicks away in the water!  Best of all, it stores away neatly in our linen closet and would probably fit in most under-sink cabinets (we have a pedestal sink, so we keep it in the closet).  I would recommend this bath seat to ANYONE and I've already purchased one for my brother's new baby!",5

Snuza Portable Baby Movement Monitor,"I would have given the product 4 stars for while it worked but am only giving it 1 based on the horrible customer service.  Other than some false alarms the product had worked okay until recently when it just so happened to be just out of their warranty period.  After wasting my money on 2 new batteries thinking that was the problem I contacted their customer service department for assistance.  BTW, you have to leave a voicemail to speak to anyone live (huge inconvenience and informal if you ask me).  After leaving an email asking why it may have stopped working and what could I do, I received a response suggesting a few things to see if I could get it to work properly.  When that failed I was asked the serial # and when I purchased it, and quickly without any empathy or true sincerity in their apology I was told that basically I was S*** out of luck and would have to buy a new one at full price.  Being extremely dissatisfied with this (not expecting a replacement on a new one but at least expecting some decent customer service and some kind of compromise or deal on a new one), I asked to speak to someone else.  My email was forwarded to the VP of their customer service department and she again with the same lack of empathy or sincerity in her apology (actually I don't know if she apologized or not), I was told again I was out of luck.  It was handled poorly and while I did not expect a new one for free I did expect a better response or at least something that would encourage me, motivate me, or entice me to buy a new one.  At this point I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  Ours malfunctioned and completely died when we used it correctly and when we never misused it.  I've received better customer service at a fast food restaurant than I received from this company.",1
Sweetums Doll &amp; Stroller Gift Set,"Very cheaply made. I thought it was a good deal when I saw it at Walmart for $5, but it wasn't a  good deal because the doll falls apart and so does the stroller. It just falls to pieces like nothing i've ever experienced. I've never witnessed such cheap crap before in my life. DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK! Especially at the price these people are selling it for! It's not even worth a dollar. It wont last a week. Stroller broke the first day. I fixed it and it kept breaking in different places. Then doll fell apart. WTF It just broke into pieces",1

Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Newborn Feeding Set,"I am a breastfeeding mom and I had a hard time to get either one of my daughters to take a bottle. I tried EVERY bottle out there, and Dr. Brown's bottles seem to be the ONLY bottles my daughters would accept. This may be due to the fact that Dr. Brown's nipples do not collapse when the babies suck, the nipple is perfect shape and size, the flow is consistent and the unique design eliminates the air bubbles, so there's definitely less gas than we experienced while trying other bottles.I took away one of the stars because of the minor problems we had with this set: these bottles require more time and effort to clean, they leak occasionally [no, I didn't fill them above the line and no, I did not overtighten them - have no idea why they leaked], the larger bottles do not fit in most of the insulated bottle totes that come with diaper bags or sold exclusively for baby bottles [and that was a little bit of a problem for us, because we only use bottles when going places, but we solved it by using a larger/taller insulated lunch bag from Ikea store] and the 4-oz bottles that come in this set will be outgrown pretty quickly. My younger daughter is 7 weeks old and she eats 4 oz per feeding and looks like she could eat more if only the bottle would hold more...I would recommend getting a set of 3 9-oz Dr. Brown's bottles as it looks like a better value and will serve you longer (you can pour as little milk or formula in a 9 oz bottle as you need, while 4 oz bottles will only hold 4 oz max, and will be useless in a couple of months at the latest).",4
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","This backpack and lunch sack are too cute! It's the perfect size for my 2 year old and she absolutely loves it. It's great for littler kids, but probably wouldn't be practical for an older kid to use for school.",5
"BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Booster Seat, Gray/Black/Green","I bought this thinking it'd would be great to travel with.  For the most part, it was.  It folded down flat and was easy to take along.  However, the front part kept folding inwards, to the point where if my son (3yo) was not strapped in, he would have slide forward and off the chair.  We fixed this by adding wood inserts under the chair to keep the front flap from sliding inwards.This is fine for now since we are using this as a permanent booster for him at the dinner table.  When we travel, though, it's going to be a little annoying since the chairs' design does not make it easy to put the wooden inserts in.  If I were to buy another one, I don't think I would buy a folding one again.",3

Kidz-Med VeraTemp 5-in-1 Non-Contact Thermometer #11900 With Pacifier Medicine Dispenser,"It is very inaccurate. I used it for a body temperature and it read 97.9... My son was actually 101.5. I t always reads 97.9 for his temperature and my temperature. The surface temperature is also way off. The only one that is the most accurate is the room temperature. If I had the package it came in, I would return it...",1
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,"Love this product, needed a pad for my changing table, the price appealed to me first.  Once I received it was very happy with it, and the bottom grips so it don't slide all over.  I like the fact that it is wipeable when little man decides to sprinkle all over, and it soaks through the covers.",5
"Summer Infant Bath Center and Shower, Blue","I bought this for my sister's baby, and it's very pretty, affordable and durable. I would really recommend this baby bath tub. she really loved it.",5
"Cosco Umbrella Stroller with Canopy, Floating","This umbrella stroller is great for an occasional use, store-in-the-car stroller. We put a 25lb. year old baby in this stroller. It's a decent construction, the fabric seems to be well-reinforced. Our last umbrella stroller ripped at the frame. The only negative I can think of is the canopy. It's a bit small, doesn't seem to cover the whole stroller, and I think with excess folding and unfolding will likely break. But it hasn't so far, and the canopy does cover my daughter's face, which is the most important part.",4
"MAM BPA Free 5 oz Bottle for Boy, 3-Pack ((Patterns and motifs may vary)","The bottles are beautiful and have a good shape, easy to handle. Air entering from the valve at the bottom is good for baby with gas problems but sometimes it leaks when I put it on water to warm it up. Close it very tight if you want to avoid leaking. Besides this it's a nice poduct and I would recommend it.",4
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","I always look at the one-star reviews to see what the worst features of the product are. The one-star reviews for this item are hilarious. Why? The manufacturer tells you that the unit is slightly splayed when you get it, and the installation process torques it straight (really easily, too).So my grandson installed it for me, and it took him about two minutes. The unit straightened up perfectly, as they said it would, and it works perfectly. If I swing it wide, it stays open, Swing it just a little towards the closed position, and it quietly swings shut, and locks. To open, just lift the gate a little, and swing it open either way, in or outwards.It feels very sturdy, and was worth every penny.So what is it keeping out of my sitting room? Three pit bulls and a rottweiler. the are sweet dogs, but they are very strong, and they don't sense any weakness in the gate that might encourage them to push a bit harder. I am sure if they put their mind to it they could break the whole damn thing down, because they are very strong. But as a gentle reminder to them that this is grandma's space, and they only come in when invited, it is plenty sturdy enough to keep them out, and not encourage them to push the limit.",5
Safety 1st Prograde Finger Pinch Preventer (Pack of 2),"These pinch preventers are so much more discreet than many other baby proofing items. Easy to remove and move around on the door, and hang nicely from the door knob when not in use.",4
Econobum One Size Cloth Diapers Trial Pack (White),"My son is now almost one year old and we have been cloth-diapering him since birth.  The prefolds are a bit bulky, and require some finesse on a newborn but within about 3 months, are much easier to fold and use.  Partly because the baby has grown some and partly from being 'broken in'.  We started off with an investment of 8 diaper covers from Econobum and 30 prefolds.  The prefolds are so sturdy, not only are they still in excellent shape, but I expect they will last the life of my son's diaper usage and possibly into diapering out next child, which we're hoping to work on sometime in the next year or so.  ;-)Now, the covers really seem flimsy, but they're not.  They fit well, and are exceptionally easy to customize to my son's growth.  As for durability, I am really impressed.  The eight covers we had (which pretty much means they are all machine-washed every TWO days) have lasted almost a year.  And I should disclose that this is after a minimum of three washes per week using the sanitary (very hot extended wash cycle), bleach and tumble drying.  The manufacturer instructions clearly say no bleach, no dryer, etc.  So yeah, we've totally abused these things and they have still held up a year.Here is the best part - including the replacement covers we bought a few days ago - we have invested less than $300 TOTAL in the cloth diapering system.  $300 Diapers from birth to potty training.  Now tell me where you will find a better deal than that??  Who needs cute covers that are more often covered than not?  Not this family.As a bonus for my recent purchase of replacement covers, each cover came with THREE prefold inserts.  Awesome bargain.",5
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,"These do a very good job, they are also a bit cheaper than many other brands out there.  They exactly what they claim to be.  But I will say they do an excellent job.Our child has never been able to remove one of them and to be honest I don't expect she will anytime soon, as they are kind of a pain for us to remove.  In truth if I have cut my fingernails recently they are almost too hard for me to remove.  Which in my opinion is probably a good thing for keeping little fingers out of outlets.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","The Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat is exactly what I was looking for!I needed something to feed my niece in. I didn't want to purchase an expensive highchair since I only babysit her once a week. The Fisher-Price Healthy Care Deluxe Booster Seat was the perfect solution.Pros:- Extremely affordable.- Can be used as a stand alone on the floor OR attaches to any chair.- Can be used with the tray OR remove the tray and push up to a table.- Great for an assortment of ages (my niece was 5 months when I purchased it).- Great Quality- Strong materials- Easy to cleanCons:- After repeated removal of the white dishwasher safe tray, it doesn't snap into place well. This is somewhat of a design flaw because it never snapped in the front, only a bit in the back and on the sides. My niece grabs the front and pulls it up. I don't like this, but it isn't the end of the world. You don't need the tray for the seat to be functional.Other than the minor con, I have no complaints with this product. It was exactly what I was expecting, and worked better than I could have hoped!",4

Baby Einstein Bendy Ball,This was a little smaller than the picture showed but a good size for a young child. Colors are bright and cheerful.,5
"Bumkins Disney Baby Waterproof Super Bib, Princess, 6-24 Months, 2 Count","These are promoted as thin and light and that they are.  They are also still very protective against the inevitable food and drink spills and slobbering that comes along with infants and toddlers.  With two to a package, the price isn't as bad as some might think it would be given the Disney name and characters that are featured on these bibs.  For current Disney (or should I say Mickey Mouse) fans, these bibs offer the opportunity to indoctrinate your children (or grandchildren) as the next generation of Disney (Mickey) fans -- not that there is anything wrong with that ;-)",4
Portable Shower Arm Safe-Grip - Portable Shower Arm Safe-Grip-By Metro Fulfillment House,"This holder has been excellent. I primarily bought it so my son could reach the shower head. However I have found it has been useful for washing pets, bathing the baby, taking a bath, etc. This surprised me how useful I find it. It does seem to have a little give in the angle it holds the shower head. Its still perfect for me, but it you are looking for exact angles this may not be for you.Pros,Easy to attach and repositionHolds to the wall very well (Has never come off)worked fine with my shower headinexpensive solutionConsThe 'neck' could be a little stronger",5

"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I have not yet had or raised children, and decided to review these for Amazon Vine as an interested consumer and design enthusiast. The anti-gas, anti-spit-up,anti-colic, ear infection protection and venting technologies on this VentAire system seem pretty impressive. However, if I had children I would be very wary of using plastic materials in feeding them. Babies are the most susceptible to food-borne impurities. These bottles are advertised as being BPA(Bisphenol-A chemical)-free. However, according to Alex Jones at Infowars and others, the medical and chemical industries knew for decades that BPA was highly dangerous to humans and deliberately kept using it in thousands of everyday products anyway. Jones claims they actually wanted to poison people as a eugenics or population control attempt. If they knowingly used BPA, then they could just as easily be using new dangerous and unknown compounds to induce illness and higher medical expenditures in today's ""BPA-free"" products. The scary thing is, to really evaluate the safety of advanced products like these, you would need to be a professional chemist and medical researcher or comparable scientist with access to all sorts of advanced information, personnel and equipment. We are literally risking our lives every day believing what the medical and industrial establishment is promising us, and they have consistently lied to us in the past. If I was nursing babies w my future wife, I would probably lean towards using glass bottles. There is no reason why manufacturers could not incorporate the same advanced technologies in these designs to protect and nurture babies using glass and sterile natural rubbers instead of plastics. We are really in a quandary as far as not really knowing what is truly safe. But they lied to us about BPA and lie to us about practically everything else. So should we really trust them now?",3
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I got this for my girlfriend, she was saying her back hurt so I thought this might help, it seems like my kids had more fun with it than she did, but thats mostly because her and I couldnt fit in bed with the pillow as well",3

"Britax Boulevard 70 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","I had read and heard many great things about Britax car seats, and they are all true!  The seat fits easily into my Honda CR-V, and installed securely without any problems.  The fabric is very soft and better quality than I expected.  My son loves to run his hands over the material!  We transferred him from his infant car seat to the Boulevard when he was 7-months old.  He loves sitting higher and having more room to squirm.  I am extremely happy with my purchase and would definitely buy another Britax product in the future!",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack","This are a little harder consistency than the size 3 nipples, which is good because now my 6th month old daughter is sucking too hard on the size 3 nipples and they are caving in. Perfect for 6 month olds!",5
Mulberry - Drapes: 1 pair,I have almost the entire Mulberry collection for my daughter's room & it is GORGEOUS. These drapes in particular are truly beautiful & I get tons of compliments on them. If you buy the bedding set it comes w/ the awning for the drapes which I didn't realize so ordered it seperately. I have an extra one unused if anyone is interested. Feel free to contact me...but yeah if you have the Mulberry bedding &/or decor I strongly recommend getting the drapes to complete the look.,5
"Joovy Room&sup2; Portable Playard, Yellow","This playpen is very well made and sturdy.  I would recommend it over any of the smaller, standard playpens for an active toddler like mine.  It was easy to assemble, requiring no tools.  There was a faint odor that lingered an hour or two after opening but it faded away.",4
BRICA Deluxe Kick Mats (2 pack),very nice!,5
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"This is the third sleep positioner I have bought since my daughter was born in August.  It's a great product for co-sleeping, especially for us since my daughter refuses to fall and stay asleep unless she can see and touch us.  The only thing that I didn't like was that I thought the foot positioner was removable and it's not.  My daughter is in the 100% for height and now she doesn't fit in it.  I will definitely use it for my next one and wish I could still use it.  It's a great product and worth the money,",4
"Vital Baby Baby's 1st Food Pots, Blue, 7 Ounce, 4 Pack","I ordered this product specifically because the photo and product statement says it comes with lids. Instead of what's pictured, I received square bowls without any lids. So annoyed.**Updated**I sent the food bowls back so that Amazon would send me the correct product. They received the exchange on 8/1...I'm STILL waiting for the bowls. I'm starting to rethink my loyalty to Amazon.",1
Personalized Pacifiers The Chevron Mustache - Pink,The item looks just as cute in person as it does on the site. Just a normal pacifier with a cute stache on it.,5
Chewbeads Mulberry Teether - Turquoise,"My daughter was teething hard. She was always trying to chew on my jewelry. Came across this, bought it and she loves it. She can wear on her wrist and teeth on it. It's soft too. Great buy",5
Fresh N Freeze 4 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 6-Pack,"We used the 2oz containers when our baby started eating foods, but then moved on to the bigger containers. These are great and stack well in the freezer keeping all of the baby food organized. They are easy to fill, serve out of, and take on the go. I used the erasable food labels on them to label all of the food and we still use them for her food, snacks, and to freeze small portions. They are durable and freeze well. I highly recommend this product if you are making your own baby food or need to freeze small portions.",5
"Bananafish Crib Mobile, Love Bird","Adorable.  Bought as a gift for my granddaughter, and after reading other reviews, let my daughter know what might be an issue.  They made sure it couldn't scratch their crib, and it works great.",5
The Original Tummy Tub Baby Bath - Clear,"This is probably a great product. My daughter was 6 months old when I purchased it though, and by then was accustomed to bathtubs, and had no interest in sitting in this container. It was frustrating, but I am hoping a friend can make use of it with her soon-to-arrive newborn.",3
Summer Infant Newborn-To-Toddler Bath Center &amp; Shower,I bought this tub for the shower feature and my son loved the spray. However the pump stopped functioning after 4 uses and the spray head is difficult to handle. I was lucky and was still within my 90 day return timeframe at Babies R Us. I returned this tub and purchased a Sure Comfort Deluxe Newborn-to-Toddler Tub.,1
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Pink","The suction on these is fine.  They do stain easily (gravy, tomato-based sauces, etc.), but they're small.  Smaller that I expected, they don't really offer a lot of room to the toddler transitioning from a highchair tray to a booster seat at the table.  But they'll work for now.  One note though, if you've got inquisitive children (like mine) they will attempt to figure out why these don't move, and eventually determine how to release the suction cups.  Just a warning. : )",3
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Scoopin Spoon, Colors May Vary","I had bought these spoons last year for my oldest when she was learning to self feed. She never really took to these because the bowl of the spoon is very deep and hard for her to get the food out with her mouth by herself. However, I recently found that these soft, rubbery spoons make wonderful teethers, as my 10 mos old quickly discovered when I accidently dropped one on the floor one day. She will chew on the bowl of the spoon for quite some time -- it seems to bring her lots of relief, and she even prefers it over most of her traditional teething toys.",3
Bicycle Stripper Deck - Red - AKA the Tapered Deck,"I would recommend these cards to anyone looking for a fun, easy, and amazing card trick. You should definitely get this deck.",5
Organic Smart Snoogle Chic - Snoogle Total Body Pregnancy Pillow with 100% Organic Cotton Easy On-off Zippered Cover,"The shape of this pillow is comfy enough, but its the material that is really terrible. First, when I received it, I had to wash it in hot water 4 times to get the terrible chemical smell out (and this is supposed to be organic cotton cover).  Also, when I put my face on it at night, the material was so rough and scratchy I had to put a pillow case over it!  Contemplating sending it back.....",3
"Carter's Butterfly Flowers Wall Decals, Pink/Choc",Love them. You get a lot for your money too! The pages were a folded when i opened the package and i was worried they wouldn't stick to the wall well but it's been a little while now and they are all still sticking on great.,4
Mommy's Helper Safe-er-Grip Foot Rest,,3
"JL Childress Wheelie Car Seat Travel Bag, Black","I've purchased this item when we were going on vacation with our 1.5 year old and needed to bring our big car seat (not the small pumpkin seat) with us.  We were traveling with our daughter on our lap, so needed to check in the car seat for when we landed. Our car seat is big and cumbersome to carry around; however, it was very easy to get the car seat in the wheelie and zip it up.  Wheels and handle worked great and it was easy to get around with it!  We were able to put some additional items, diapers and such, in the bag, so that was a great bonus. Highly recommend it!",5
"OXO Tot Plate, Green","She never stops looking for this plate, even after she's old enough to use usual plates. If she sees this one, she takes it.It doesn't slide on feeding-chair's tray, and the green ring helps the food stay in the plate, and it helps the child fork the food. It washed well considering the amount of tomato-sauce pasta my daughter consumes.",5
"Kushies Splash Mat, Zoo Animals","This item is going back.  This is very flimsy, basically it's the same material as a disposable party-store table cloth.  I put it on my hardwood floors underneath our highchair, and couldn't even stand on it, I was slipping and sliding all over the place.  Our poor dog went flying....  :)  Unfortunately, all you have to do is slide the highchair just a little bit, and the whole thing moves with it, crinkling all up, and pretty much defeating its purpose.  Need to find something with a little more substance...needs to be thicker and sturdier.",1
"Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Tower Chest, White","We ordered this product, that matching hutch, and crib. The crib was fine. This piece had scratches and dings as soon as we took it out of the box. Looked like someone else had sent it back and they tried to cover up the scratches and sent it right back out to the next customer. Where they had tried to fix it the color of the stain just flaked right off and looked horrible !! There was a phone number on the box that said no not return product to store for damaged parts just call us and we will ship just what you need. The phone number did not work and was impossible to reach the company (located in Canada). So now we have to pay to ship the entire thing back to amazon wait for a refund and hope for better luck with the next one we order so it will match our crib. Still waiting on the hutch to ship was supposed to be here a week ago and item is not even on backorder ! Goodluck for you guys and hopefully I will get everything squared away before the baby gets here ! Next time I will def. just find something at a local store.",1
"The First Years Indigo Stroller, Red","I do love the stroller, but the wheels were squeaking the first day i used it and the front wheels are very hard to maneuver. The fact that the wheels are horrible I wouldn't recommend.",1
KidCo Outlet Plug Cover,I ordered these to keep my two year old from pulling cords out of their sockets.  After installing these plug covers it took him literally 10 seconds to figure out how to open them.  He can close them properly as well.  Really?  This makes them completely worthless to me.  Can someone make one that actually works??,1
Infantino Compact 2-in-1 Shopping Cart Cover,"we used this for the first time this weekend. it is kind of hard to fold up, but it works great at covering the high chairs",4
Hot Newborn Baby Boy Girl Anti-roll Pillow Flat Head Sleeping Positioner Bear,Not what I expected very disappointed!!!  I would not have wasted my time on this had I known this was what it was going to be.,1
North States Pressure Mount Diamond Mesh Wood Gate,"This gate works but you can tell it's a ""cheap"" gate. Its frame is made out of soft, light-weight wood. Other than that, it's great. Easy to use. To adjust the length, you just move a little metal ""peg"" to the desired length (there's numbers on the adjuster, so you know you're adjusting it to the right lenghth). To install, you just push the arm down. To remove, you just lift the arm up. How much easier can it get?!",4
Bright Starts Soothing Safari Mobile,i liked it very much and my baby too. she loved it looking on it when lieing in her bed.,5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",I needed a 2nd car seat for a different vehicle. I already have the same brand car seat only in a different color. When i saw this one i knew i wanted the same one because we already loved it.,5
"Tike Tech Double City X3 Swivel Stroller, Pacific Blue","I was reluctant to buy this based on some of the reviews, but I am more than pleased that we decided to go with this stroller.  Contrary to the reviews, the fabric is durable, and very comfortable and thick.  We have a BOB single jogger, and the fabric quality is a million times better for $100 less. It is strong, easy to push and turn ( love the shocks and turnable front wheel), fairly compact for a double stroller (wheels come off for easy storage), and there is lots of leg room. My only 2 wishes are that 1- the seats could be less reclining (it's not as easy as other strollers to adjust the incline), and 2- it doesn't come with cup holders, but they can be purchased.  I love, love, love this stroller. It was worth every penny.",5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"OK first they are easy to clean.  Second the nipples DO NOT collapse. Third, they cut down on bubbles.  Sometimes they leak, but thats easy to cure...DONT SCREW EM ON SOOOO TIGHT!  LOL....buy em, you wont go wrong!",5

Tommee Tippee Explora Easi-Roll Bibs,But I like to use it with a cloth bib underneath to catch the wet spills that drip between the chin and the tommee tippee bib,5
Evenflo Soft N Wide Gate,"This gate is outstanding, and I've received much envy over it. I use it in the wide doorway between my kitchen and dining room. I don't have to use any locks on my kitchen cabinets now because my daughter cannot access the kitchen. I love that she can still see me through it, and she has never hurt herself on any bars. In fact, she loves to smoosh her face against the mesh, so it is actually entertainment for her if I am doing the dishes or cooking. It is the perfect size, and great if you are trying to outsmart little toddlers who have figured out how to work the doors on classic baby gates. My friend bought one after seeing mine to deter her 3 and 5 year old from running through the kitchen. So it works great for a long period of time, and takes abuse well. I give this only 4 stars because assembly was a tad bit awkward, and I often bang my foot or knee trying to get over the gate. Even my husband who is 6'5&#34; will bang his knee or shin if he isn't careful. So this is annoying, but so much better than installing 30 cupboard locks or having my child play with the trash can. I'd buy it a thousand times over again if I needed to.",4
Safety 1st Musical Talkin Potty and Step Stool,"I have 2 little boys, one is 19 months and started potty training about a month ago. I started with this potty, the guard is nothing spectacular, I couldn't tell you how many times he has sprayed me. And then it leaked between the bowl and the hole. I had to hold it down for him too. After the first day I went to get another potty seat that is much better. The guard is high and the seat is cushioned. I mean the potty was cute, but just not practical enough for me.",1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I found one of these at a local yard sale, and never imagined it would be so useful. Now with two kids, one wasn't enough. Camping, napping, or just hanging out on a pint size piece of furniture... this cot is a great option.",5

"Thirsties Stay-Dry Duo Insert, White, Size One (6-18 lbs)","These are fantastic inserts. I use these before any of our other inserts. I have microfiber, microfiber/bamboo, prefolds, flour sack towels, etc. Lots of different kinds. These are excellent for absorption and thin enough to not cause a lot of diaper bulk. There are two parts that snap together. The natural fiber cotton/hemp blend takes longer to dry then the microfiber, but this is a great combo. If they were more reasonably priced I'd have these exclusively in our diaper stash.",5
Twin Swift Stroller -Navy w/ Mesh Basket,If you live in the New York/ New Jersey area. There is a chain of stores called Buy Buy Baby &#60;[...] that does carry the Twin Swift as well as other side by side strollers. They have floor models so you can check it out first.,5
"SafeFit By My Side Harness with Backpack, Black/Blue(Light and Dark)/Grey","I bought this backpack harness for international plane travel with my active two-year-old. I liked that this one holds a bit more than some of the other backpack harnesses out there, so she could have a favorite stuffed animal or toys.  My daughter actually asks to wear it and the leash can be removed for those times.  Luckily haven't actually had to leash her more than a couple of times but, I was relieved to have this during our travels.",4
Philips AVENT 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer,I bought this in May 2012 and finally started to use it on Setp 2012. It works for 3 months and it stop working.  we use this steamer three times a day only. the reason I give it one star is that I get to use it for free for three months.  lucky that I could stil return it to amazon.comI give amazon.com a five stars (*****),1
10/pk - Enfamil Disposable Slow-Flow Soft Nipples,"I only uses these nipples for trips when we do not want to mess with bottles and formula. We use these with ""Similac ready to feed"" and work fine when I say that you can get your baby fed. The bad thing is that this nipple collapses when baby sucks, you have to pull out the bottle so you can get some air into the bottle and then continue feeding the baby. Another drawback is that they are very expensive, I would like nipples with a better price.",3

Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker,"I love this little machine.  I worked as a professional nanny for years before having my own baby and I made a lot of baby food during that time (lucky kids :)  This machine makes home made baby food a cinch!Here is what I love:Smaller batches - unless you are living your own version of ""baby boom"" you just don't need to make gallons of apple sauceFast!  I can have baby food in about 10 minutes, so if I run out, it just takes a few minutes to make something freshGreat puree - really smooth and creamy, or as chunky as you wishit's small - not a space hog in my cramped kitchenLooks cute - so I don't having it out all the timeIf you are leaning towards getting the device, or registering one for your baby shower - DO IT!  you will love it, promise.",5
"OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Pink","This is the perfect (yes, pun intended!) wipe dispenser to use with cloth wipes.  Instead of having to spray each wipe with solution before I use it, now I can simply soak the wipes in the solution, fold and place them in the dispenser and... voila I am ready for diaper duty!",5
"Angelcare Baby Sound Monitor, White","This was a gift, but they told me it worked very well.It also is nice looking.  They are quite pleased with it.",4
ERGO Baby Organic Backpack - Dark Chocolate,I switched to this backpack from my traditional messenger style diaper bag and couldn't be happier.  The backpack style is so much easier for me to carry around and I LOVE the straps that are intended to attach the bag to the ergo carrier.  I use these straps to attach it to my stroller (BOB) handle or a shopping cart leaving more space for 'stuff' in the cart and makes it easy to access while shopping.  I love the nice material and that I am able to machine wash/dry it.  There a a nice number of pockets and plenty of space in the body of the bag.,5
"Bunnies by the Bay Wee Plush, Rutabaga","This toy is so soft and cuddly, and it seems very well made. I bought it for my infant, but my two year old has adopted it.",5
Fisher-Price Deluxe Space Saver High Chair,"the only thing I would change about this is perhaps more flexible rubber straps. They can be stiff when moving them away to put baby in, making it difficult. Everything else about it is wonderful: great neutral design that's appealing, the fabric is easy to wash, space saver, and most importantly, cleans up easy. my 2.5 month old loves sitting at the table while everyone eats vs being on the floor.",5
MOBI TykeLight Green,was looking and looking for night lights. Used a few different ones and did not like them. Found this one on-line decided to give it a try. So I bought 2. One for my son and one for my daughter. They loved them. They have dimmers and timers. They are easy to use. The pink is not as bright as the blue. Very durable. They have fallen down stairs and  been put in mouths. I plan on buying more for other parts of the house. Great product.,5

Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,"This is my third high chair model. I have used a Chico, a Graco wooden style, and then this Fisher Price model. I like that the straps are plastic, and that the cover can be removed very easily and washed. However, it still has many cracks and crevices that food collects in. As a person who has a slight bit of OCD, I can not stand leaving the food to sit in the tiny creases of the plastic chair, so I find myself having to clean it out with toothpicks. So annoying If I were you, I would invest my money wisely and get a Boon High chair. My friend has one, and she can basically put her whole chair in the dish washer!",2
Medela Pump in style Advanced Power Adaptor 9207010 9V,"I was about to pump one night and my pump suddenly did not work.  I realized the wire was frayed and quickly found a new plug on Amazon.  It had free super saver shipping and even though I needed it quickly, I could not justify paying for shipping on a $30 product.  Luckily it came in 2 days anyway and was exactly what I needed.",5
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,Taggies big soft blocks.  My 6 moonth old Granddaughter loved these blocks (so did my nine year old West Highland White Terrier).  They have little tags everywhere and are very tactile as well as cute animal designs.  They are very well made and will last a long time.  The fun animal designs will be more interesting as baby gets older.,5
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Standard Glass Bottles,  4 Ounce, 2-Count","Glass have to be better then plastic, we know it and I think babies feel it too :)I think that worm milk is better from these bottles than from the plastic ones, because plastic tends to add some funny taste or smell to the milk especially if you are worming it up in the bottle over and over -I think!That is my opinion and considering that no baby can tell you which kind it prefers and no adult is going to keep drinking his milk out of this type of bottles you should consider what kind of glassware would you like drinking your worm beverage from: glass or plastic! I know I prefer glass so my baby prefers it too :)Oh yes, and the natural flow system that these bottles have works flawlessly!",5

Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"When my baby grew too big to fit in her Puj (which we loved!), I was overwhelmed with the amount of choices for baby tubs. The plastic ones appeared to get good ratings, but they didn't seem like they could be all that comfortable. That's when my mom stepped in and found this gem. She said that back when we were babies, she used them and loved them. Mother knows best. We have used this bath sponge since baby was 2+ months and we're still going strong at 5+ months. Its a win win for everyone.",5
Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,"I purchased this crib mattress to go with my grandson's new crib. It is a very nice, quality mattress. It fits perfectly in the Dream On Me 4 in 1 crib we purchased. He seemed to like it when we placed him on it. He slept soundly all night through. I would definitely recommend this mattress to anyone considering it.",4
"Baby K'tan Baby Carrier, Black, X-Large","LOVE my K'tan. This product was an absolute lifesaver for this mom of a busy baby boy. He wanted to see everything and with this, he could. Works well with little bitties as well. I often wrapped BB up in this, put a coat on both of us, and went for a walk. Great way to keep everyone warm and get some exercise in the winter!",5
Baby Jogger City Micro Double Stroller - Black,"I normally don't review all these products, but this one deserves it! I have tried multiple double strollers and have found myself disappointed. The Kolcraft that does multiple things was much too big and very hard to maneuver, especially while walking our dog. We also have a double jogger and love it, but it doesn't go through a regular sized door. This stroller meets all of our needs. It is very easy to maneuver, even with one hand, it fits through ALL doors, which is a huge plus, and it fits in a small trunk. It also looks very nice. If I had one complaint, it would be the straps. They are sort of low quality, without the ability to adjust as you can on some other strollers. Overall, I give this stroller 5 stars, well worth the money to have both children contained and comfortable.",5
Fisher Price Fisher Price Fastfinder Deluxe Messenger Bag,"Alot of different rooms with marking makes it easier to know where everything is. No need to dig for ages in the bag, just look after the right symbol, and voila! there is the wet wipes, diapers, bottle and pacifier found in no time at all. it have more than good enough space because it is that organized !Please not that this is my first impression. it is still to find out if it works just that good out in the field! If i make any special discoveries, you will get updated :)",5
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free Glass Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology and Bonus Silicone Sleeve, 3-Pack","I think these are the best bottles out there. They are easy to clean, light weight, durable, and don't leak. I have used them with my LO since he was 4 months old for Breast milk feeding. He has never been fussy, never had nipple confusion, and he can hold the bottle on his own.  At 7 months of age, I have continued to use these bottles and nipples. I like the slower flow nipples since we r still breast feeding. He is eating solids now, this is still enough milk for a feeding. We recently bought a born free sippy cup, to convet our bottles to cups and all parts fit. I do recommend these bottles.",5
"Graco Backless TurboBooster Seat, Galaxy","My daughter is of the right age and weight to be upgraded from a car seat to a booster seat and it works marvelously.  It is very light, where if we travel we can take it with us and she can carry it if she so chooses based solely on the light weight.  The design is awesome and the best thing is the cup holders that fold in to get out of the way and pop out so easily that a small child can do it with no assistance at all.  The material comes off easily for washing and can be placed back on without having to worry about putting it wrong or needed instructions to fasten it back in place.  Thus far, I have no complaints...",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was so excited when I recieved this tub thinking it would last for years. Well, first you can NOT use it in your home bathtub, because the suction cups will not adhere to a non-slip surface. Most tubs are non-slip, that's what the little bumps are for in your tub. This was fine though, I planned to use it on our kitchen counter. No matter how hard I pressed on the middle ""locking"" device water always leaked out onto the counter and floor. This tub is more trouble than it's worth!",1

Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,I love this sippy cup! The first time I tried it with my child she did great. Super easy for her to use. Not the easiest to clean and it does leak on occasion. But they are perfect for on the go. I will for sure buy another one.,4

Fresh N Freeze 2 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 12-Pack,"I bought these containers for my niece, who has just started making her own baby food. She absolutely loves them! She fills them up & freezes them, then in the morning takes out what she needs for the day to thaw. Making your own baby food is more economical, plus you know exacatly what is (& isn't) in it.",5
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,We have an older version of this chair that my mom got us at a yard sale.  I LOVE IT.  We use it at any restraunt we go to it's so much nicer than a nasty highchair because he can sit right up to the table and you can easily get in and out of a booth without moving the highchair around.  I get comments every time we're out and using it how neat it is and asking where I got it.  It's also nice because a lot of restraunts won't put a highchair up to a booth so you have to wait longer to get a table.  With this chair we can sit anywhere I just keep it in the car so it's there when we need it.,5
"Baby Brezza Temperature Control Kettle, White/Grey","Seems the older I get, the more problems I have with sinus infections and the like. My doctor got me started on using the neti pot for nasal irrigation, and I do use it when needed. Actually, I mostly use the NeilMed squeeze bottle and saline packages for this purpose, because it is easier than a true neti pot and because it is better for use when packing into luggage for a trip. At home I also have a SinuPulse irrigation machine that comes out when I think the pulsing action might help to break up really thick gunk in the nasal passages.However, there is always the question of whether the water I am using is safe. Some places have too much chlorination and this can cause a burning sensation in the nasal passages. At home, I have well water, filtered but not chlorinated. According to studies I have read, the main problem with well water is the very unlikely possibility of getting an infection of the amoeba ""Naegleria fowleri"", which can destroy the brain if introduced into the nasal passages (just swimming in certain lakes and rivers, and getting water into your nose can infect you, so it is not limited to nasal irrigation). Most studies I have read state that this is not likely to be a problem in wells in the northern part of the States, where I live, and should not be a problem if wells are at least 40 feet deep and not near to a body of fresh water such as a lake. My well is 130 feet deep, so I have used water from it for years without problems, but still the concern lingers.I could use bottles of distilled water from the store, but then it needs to be heated before use. I tried the microwave but it was hard to get the right temperature and it took too long, and this discouraged me from doing it that way. I also tried using an immersion coil heater in a small pot of distilled water, and this also worked but was awkward and slow.Finally I Googled 'device for preheating water for nasal irrigation', and at the top of the results was this Baby Brezza temperature controlled water kettle. It is intended for preheating water for baby's bottles (when they are just drinking water, not milk), and got mostly good reviews on Amazon, so I bought one.The kettle seems to be made pretty well, and has a sold, quality feel. It consists of two parts, the power base and the kettle itself. The base is just a flat plastic disk with a short power cord, and is intended for being left constantly plugged into the wall socket on a shelf or table. At its center is a raised connector that is sealed so that when the kettle is not resting on it, the electrical connections cannot be touched.The kettle has the heating element built into its bottom end, and there is a connector on the bottom side that mates with the raised connector on the base. The connector docks and undocks with very little force, so you don't feel it making the connection and there is no need to hold the base down when lifting the kettle from it.The kettle has one side made of clear frosted plastic, with graduations showing the volume of water in the kettle (in ounces). The kettle holds up to 51 ounces. The lid is locked and can be opened by pressing a button on the top. You don't need to open the lid to pour water into the baby's bottle.At the bottom of the kettle is a digital readout that constantly shows the water temperature in degrees Fahrenheit. This works whether the kettle is trying to heat the water or not. To heat the water, there is a large switch on the handle, and when this is turned on, the kettle will warm the water to 98 degrees Fahrenheit, plus or minus a couple degrees, and hold it at that temperature until you turn the power switch off. Note that the digital temperature display still works any time the kettle is resting on the base. A nifty feature is the there is a colored LED lamp inside the kettle, and it seems to color the water and is easily visible through the transparent side of the kettle. When the water is too cold, the water appears red, but when the water has reached the 98 degrees, the water appears blue. So any time the water is blue, you know it is safe to use for the baby, being virtually at body temperature. In my first test, I poured distilled water, which had just come from the store and was cool but not very cold, into the kettle until it was about half full. It took approximately three minutes to reach 98 degrees.Note that this product is intended for use only with clear water such as distilled or filtered water. It should not be used for milk, juices, or anything that will leave a residue inside the kettle. For cleaning, it is hard to reach inside and trying to clean it after use with anything other than water would be difficult. When used with water, it should need only occasional cleaning with liquid dish soap and water water, swished around, poured out and then a rinse.Also note that the instructions clearly state that this kettle is designed and intended for being left plugged in constantly, so there is always warm water available. There is no need to unplug it, or turn the power off, in between uses. You only want to unplug it or turn it off for long periods of disuse.Because of this, it seems ideal for nasal irrigation. I fill it in the evening before going to bed, and it is ready for use when I get up in the morning. Because it heats so quickly without overshooting to a higher temperature, it is also handy for unplanned irrigations. The spout at the top of the kettle is nicely shaped for pouring the water into a neti pot, NeilMed bottle, etc. When poured through the nasal passages, the water does not seem either cold or warm, because it is at body temperature.I have not head this product long enough to comment on its durability.",5
Diono Travel Pal Car Storage,"I bought this to organize all the toys my almost 2 year old was losing on the floor of the car. I wanted him to have something he could reach and get things out of. He is sooo much happier in the car that I don't have to hand him toys. He can get a sip of water and then read a book and then play with his toy phone and he's a happy camper. I did have to put it up onto the pull down cup holder in the backseat so he could reach it. I think without doing that it would not have worked for what I needed it for, within his reach. It seems very durable and sturdy so far. Amazon shipped it super fast and I'm glad we got it. I would recommend it.",4
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Busy Baby Booster,"I use this thing all the time, and not just for feeding my kid.  The toys on the seat are genius!  My child is 8 months, so sitting still even to eat is a chore for him.  But having a washable insert tray means that I can distract him with toys while I prep his food (or dinner for that matter).  He's up and not on the floor and feels like he's part of the conversation and what I'm doing.  When I'm feeding him, if he's being particularly wiggly I just pop in the toy tray and he is distracted enough to continue eating versus trying to escape... I have a very active little boy.  It's all dishwasher safe as well, which makes for easy and quick cleaning.  I can see this growing with him too, as he can use the booster and sit at the table as he gets older.",5

NUK Nature Design Learner Cup 5oz. 6m+ Latex Spout (Green),"This cup is great, I have several, but the colored spout is horrible. It does not allow air to enter properly when liquid exits the cup, eventually the spout sinks into the cup and no more liquid can come out until the lid is vented. Very confusing for my toddler, and annoying for us parents. I had to order clear replacement spouts, they work properly. I have 2 colored spouts and both of them have this air vent problem. Get the clear spouts only.",1
"Trend Lab Giggles Blooming Bouquet Wash Cloths, Set of 5","I bought these for my newborn daughter.  They just aren't soft.  I love the pattern, but they are scratchy.

"Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue","This is AWESOME.  Very simple to use - no programming. No thinking. Just hit the button with the right picture.  This is a HUGE help when you wake up and 3 in the morning and want to know how long it was since the last feeding... the brain doesn't do clock math on its own that well... especially when its the 4th day in a row of getting up at 3 in the morning... You think you can do it, but the days/times start to blur together a bit.  This takes the thinking right out of it... totally recommend it.",5
"North States Superyard 3 In 1 Arched Decor Metal, Matte Bronze","Pros:Great sturdy gate, easy installation, very attractive.The gate will stay fully open, or spring shut when part-closed.Although not included in the instructions, it is possible to mount an odd-number of segments by exchanging end-caps from the even-segments.Cons:The gate portion is a bit narrow (maybe 1.5 ft)The gate tends to spring shut a bit easily (potentially trapping pets or guests in the enclosed area if they bump the gate)No fractional lengths means you must snake the fence around a bit if your walls are not exactly the right distance apart.Be careful when opening that you don't open the box upside-down onto your floor.  The arched gate-top will scrape against your floor with all the weight of the rest of the gate on top of it.I've listed a lot of cons, in case these are non-starters for you.  I still give the gate five stars because I don't think you'll find a better gate for your needs, and the price is great.  We love this baby gate.",5
"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster, Carbon",Bought this for our Florida trip from northern Indiana.  Have a 7 year old son and wanted him to have more protection and more comfort than just a standard booster seat.  This worked perfectly!  Drove the 20 hours straight thru and he was able to sleep and did NOT complain once about it.  Highly recommend this product.,5

"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce","This cup is well made and worth the price. However, the integral part of this bu being leak proof is that when the lid shuts it pinches the straw off.So if your child bites or chews on the straw then they will render it useless - it will leak any time the cup is anything but absolutely upright. There are replacement straws but they are just as expensive as a completely new cup.Since this is designed for children I feel that the design is flawed. For an adult audience that will not chew their straw up this will work for years. But kids are prone to chew on their straws - because they are teething, bored, or just generally destructive of &#34;all the nice things you buy.&#34; Ha!",3

While it does not have the Velcro I was looking for, they people who responded to my question swore by them, & what can I say - I love them.  The Velcro has not been an issue in the way I was concerned it might be, & it holds up well to tugging by little hands! I like many of i Play's products & these are Organic Cotton.  I would certainly buy them again, & I will recommend them to my friends.",5
"Boon Benders Adaptable Utensils, Blue/White","The bendable features seems great, but the spoon area that's suppose to hold food needs better design. It holds very little food and it's hard to scoop up food. My 14 months old son only used this spoon a few times.  After he got the hang of feeding himself, he prefers his regular Gerber or The First Year disposable spoons that he can more easily scoop up food.",2

Evenflo Comfort Select Performance Single Electric Breast Pump,"I got this pump due to the cheap price, once I got it home and attempted to use it I found out why it was so cheap the suction was so low that I had to firmly smash it against my skin to the point of making red marks just to get any type of suction at all and then It would take about 2 days just to get 4 oz out of this thing. Steer clear of this pump even with the cheap price it's not worth it.",1

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I bought this based on the good quality and bright colors of the Lamaze Peackock which is perfect for my 6 months boy. I incorrectly assumed Lamaze products were of high quality, I was wrong, this lacks of bright color, looks like a fake, I have seen other buyers pictures and there is no way the product I received is the same, bad for me I had this brought to my country by a friend of mine.

"Under the Nile Organic Cotton Side Snap Baby Tee NB to 6M (NB-3M, Blue)",The Product Description makes it sound like you're buying a set of shirts (not just one). I would never paid that much for just one shirt. I was very disappointed when I opened the package.,2
"The First Years True Fit Convertible Car Seat, Monet","I have been using this carseat for about a year now (my daughter is 19 months). We still have her rear-facing. The only downfall (as stated in other reviews) is the strap adjustment is hard to reach while rear-facing. I don't tighten and loosen it every time we get her in and out of the carseat. We just keep it tight enough and we don't have a problem getting her in and out. As far as room-wise, we have a 2007 Chevy Malabu. It fits just fine! I guess if you have a really small car it might be hard to fit. Anyway, we love this carseat it feels a lot safer and sturdier than the Costco one my friend has for her daughter. I did a lot of research on the carseat and we have the Monet (pink flowered one) pattern. It's really pretty! We would definately recommend this carseat to anyone looking for a sturdy, safe carseat that your child can use for years!!!",5
WallStickerUSA Medium &quot;Together WE MAKE A FAMILY&quot; Quote Saying Wall Sticker Decal Transfer Film 17x25,"The product arrived in a protected tube. The instructions were extremely difficult to read - I have good eye site and I had to pull out a magnify glass. Thankfully there was a YouTube link to view because otherwise the written instructions made zero sense. We followed the instructions and during the application process the piece folded on top of itself and since the adhesive was so strong it ruined the whole piece. I contacted the company and they said I should just buy another one. I looked up other companies policies and most say that if an error occurs during the application process they will ship you a new one for free &#8211; you just need to pay for S & H. I DO NOT recommend a wall decal that is one giant piece, opt for ones that are in multiple pieces.",3

Foogo Cup,"The first thing that impressed me about this sippy cup was that the valve was not in the spout so my son was not able to chew it and ruin the cup. I also liked that it is a pretty light weight cup even though it is made of metal, and the thermos aspect is great as well. The first couple of times that he used it the cup worked really well so I went and bought a second one. Within a week both cups leak so badly that I am going to return them. Even though the cup is supposed to be dishwasher safe I have only ever hand washed all of the parts so I am very disappointed.",2
"MAM Love and Affection 2 Pack Pacifier Clips, Colors May Vary","My daughters hate pacis but love their teething toys.

The First Years Disney Pooh Peek &amp; Teethe Crinkle Book,This is a great gift for new or expecting parents.  Babies are going to chew and scrunch the pages of any book.  Getting the hard cardboard like books is just a waste for really young children who are more interested in chewing than reading.  If your really want to get a book for an infant then I would recommend this.  The teething pieces are great for little mouths and kids will love the sound the pages make.,5
Baby Trend Triplet Stroller in Navy,We ordered this triplet stroller when my daughter-in-law found that she was expecting triplets.  We are pleased with the stroller except for the fact that the front seat will not stay in the upright position.  Since we were past the 30 day period for return to Amazon and had discarded the box the stroller had been sent in we are evidently out of luck.  For almost three months we have been trying to get through to the Breckenridge Company who only seem to have part time people working to solve problems.  They have no suggestions other than sending the entire stroller back to them (we had discarded the box) which will take probably many weeks instead of sending a new one in exchange for the malfunctioning one.  They also said they would send a mailing label which has not been received.  We are very disappointed.  They certainly do not seem to stand behind their product!!  So be wary and check every aspect of the stroller IMMEDIATELY.,2
Bottombumpers Organic Cotton and Velour Cloth Wipes - 6 pack,"I ordered these wipes along with some flannel ones.  When these arrived I was surprised because the package looked so big, I knew it was only 6 wipes in there; when I opened the package (came in a biodegradable & reusable package!) and inspected the wipes I was very satisfied to say the least.  Words cannot describe how soft, sturdy, and luxurious these wipes are.  They are very well made.  I'm still pregnant so I haven't had a chance to use them on baby yet, but just thinking about how my babies bottom would be wiped by these made me feel great . . . . and a little jealous - just a little.  I've also decided to use these for baby washcloths - they're much softer than the ones I bought from Carter's.  Each wipe has a small label on it (with washing instructions, etc); I didn't like this at first, but after trying them out myself the tag never got in the way.  I suppose you could just cut it off it was irritating.  These are thick, so I can't bring as many with me (like thinner wipes) - but you should never need more than one to get the job done.  Overall, I love these wipes- I've used them on my hands, face, and one other area I won't mention.  I'll update my post once baby arrives.",5

People just read crap on the internet/ consumer report and believe it without using their own brain. I'd be interested to know how their kids are going to turn out. My husband and I are very educated and we did our own research. What we found out was that this stroller was one of the safest, most user friendly and comfortable for our daughter. It supports rear facing for as long as possible with the rotation feature, the materials are high quality and all of the harnesses are toddler proof. It is extremely light weight and folds with a click compactly. This will be your best investment if you can afford it. If you cannot afford luxury lines of products, then get a graco, because you will whine forever.",5
Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor,"I think I have finally come to the conclusion that there is no ""perfect"" monitor.  My wife and I have been through 4 different monitors and none of them do everything right.  Our last one was a Summer Infant monitor and the video was great, and the sound was amazing, but it kept breaking in one way or another so we returned it to get this one.I'll start by saying the features are fantastic.  The panning, the intercom feature, and the thin touch screen receiver all are great.  Another great aspect is that we have had little to no interference, which is a first in our monitor experience.  A little fuzzy at times, but nothing as annoying as bursts of static, or running static or anything.  This makes just a little bit of noise, and that is very welcome.The problem is the video and sound.  The video is a HUGE step down from our last much cheaper video monitor.  VERY choppy.  Also, with the sound all the way up, it is about as loud as our last monitor was halfway.  We are actually at the point to returning this one because it honestly might be something wrong with our monitor the sound is so low.So it seems Summer spent all their time putting in these ""cool new features"", but the normal monitor features were the side note.  Don't be swayed by these touch features, or anything else.  If you are looking for good video and good sound, this is not the monitor for you.UPDATE:  After over a year with this product, I have learned to enjoy this monitor more then my original review.  I have raised it to 4 stars.  The video is still choppy, but the sound is not as low as I make it seem.  It's lower then our previous ones, but it works.  TThe 2 biggest things that I love about this monitor is that in over a year of having this we have NEVER had any static or bad interferences of ANY KIND.  That is huge.  We have had a few ""No Signal"" messages, but they literally last between 1-10 seconds.  Then it's back.The other thing is that we have ZERO issues with it.  It hasn't broken, the camera still pans and zooms perfectly, and the battery still keeps a long charge.  So I would recommend this product, but again, the drawback is the video is not nearly as smooth as other products.UPDATE 2:  After about 2 years to the date, this finally died on us.  The video starting blinking for a few days, and it finally just stopped picking up the video.  It was a good time anyway, since our daughter is big enough now she doesn't need it in her room.  We used this every night, all night hooked to the charger for 2 years, so I'm not upset because we got a good amount of use from it.  Just wanted to give an update for anyone who is interested to know how long it lasted at least for 1 consumer.",4

I have a dishwasher and a larger dish rack that I use for pots and pans, but when it comes to keeping the kitchen organized when I'm just rinsing my tea pot, etc., this is perfect!  I get many great comments.  I think the grass version would be fun, too.",5

The Baby Bunch Large Bunch Blue 0 to 6 Months,"It looks like all of the reviews for this have been by the gift givers and that makes sense: it looks like a cool and memorable gift and the recipients are always going to write a nice thank you letter...However, as a new mom receiving this, I can assure you that it is an AWFUL GIFT. Once you get past the ""cute"" gimmick of a bouquet, you're left with a truly nasty experience of trying to unwrap the clothing from layers of stinky (chemical smell) and sticky wrapping only to be left with a small selection of boring low quality clothing. Then you have to wash that clothing multiple times to get the nasty smell out.Now that I've checked out how much this ridiculous thing costs I so wish I could have returned this gift for something more worth the price.So if you're considering giving a baby shower gift, PLEASE consider something more thoughtful/useful/meaningful than this mess.",1

"Playtex Insulated &amp; Spill-Proof Cup, Coolster Tumbler, (Colors and Designs May Vary) 1 ea","We have three of these currently and I am tempted to buy more (have been looking at the Foogo, we currently have one of those, but it is just as effective as those, and doesn't have a straw to leak).  There are some pros and cons to these cups. They do keep liquid cool (maybe not fresh from the fridge cold, but we always add ice and that helps too). They don't leak if they are properly sealed (you need to go past the arrow on the lid, and yes I have sometimes had issues where it took me a couple of times to get the lid open, but it's a rare occasion). If there is liquid that comes out, it is usually from what is left it the little hole where they sip from (or from me not tightening the lid properly). Looks like a grownup's coffee mug, my kids sometimes prefer these to other cups that we have. Although I do like a straw, those can be a hassle to clean, these just have the single plug that goes into two slots in the underside of the cup's lid. Colors are nice (we have a dark blue (my daughter calls it indigo) and green and turquoise, all can be unisex. Tapered bottoms that will fit into cup holders. And for the price you can pay for one Foogo (which will leak, trust me, we've been using ours for three years, can't count how many times I've had to clean up a whole 10oz of liquid that have spilled from cups being on their sides), you can purchase three of this one at the same price. BPA free (that's a plus) and will withstand any number of hard falls. These really are good little cups.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,Pros:  lots of music and toys to play with.  Easy height adjustment.Cons:  peekaboo tiger and sunshine toy is really lame - baby hates that side of the jumper.,4
"Infantino Wrap and Tie Baby Carrier, Black Blueberries","I bought this carrier when my daughter was about 4 weeks old; she's now 10 weeks old.  I had a Moby that I borrowed from a friend but could never quite get to work, and my daughter hated being in it.  I also have a Bjorn Active, but she seemed pretty precarious in that when she was so little.This carrier is nearly perfect for infants.  It's not quite as easy to put on as the Bjorn, but MUCH easier than the Moby, and it gives that nice snug fit that the Moby did.  It's much lighter weight than the Bjorn, so it's easier on my back.  I have the khaki-colored version, so I haven't had any problems with it showing dirt and dust.  I wish the straps weren't so long (one size fits all), but I just wrap them around to my back and tie them again loosely.  [I'm 5'4"" and 145 lbs.]  I think this carrier would fit most people.  The fabric is thick, and the construction seems to be of good quality. It might be hot in hot weather, but most carriers are.This has been a life saver.  My daughter won't sleep anywhere except while being held.  Now, once she's fed/diapered/etc and getting fussy (i.e., needs to sleep), I pop her in and walk around and sing.  After a couple of minutes of fussing, she is sound asleep, sometimes for several hours.  I can do a little light work around the house, plus I can sit and type at the computer (she's in the wrap right now).*******Update 8/1/2010--my daughter is now almost 5 months old, and this carrier still works great with her facing me for her naps.  She now weighs about 15 lbs, and it's not bad for a couple hours of use (especially if I can sit for part of the time).  She starts to strain my back when I have to walk around with her for a couple of hours, but less so than when she is forward-facing in the Bjorn Active.I have tried the face-out option, and it works OK, but I probable prefer to face her out in the Bjorn Active (it's quicker to put on).  The Wrap and Tie is a little tall for her facing out, so I have to try to scrunch down the front, and I worry about her falling asleep and having her nose down in it.  This carrier is definitely better than the Bjorn Active for facing-in naps (more support on the back of her neck so that her head doesn't flop around while she's sleeping).  A friend is sending me her Ergo, so I will compare all three once I've tried it.********Update 8/25/2010--Once I got the Ergo, I stopped using the Wrap and Tie.  Both hold the baby snug and close to me, facing in, for sleeping.  The Ergo is super easy to put on and great for my back.  I am now an Ergo convert.In summary---1) Infantino Wrap and Tie:  Pros = Great for little ones, facing in, for sleeping.  Easier to put on than the Moby and yet keeps baby nice and snug.  Can face baby out.  Sturdy.  Cheap (cheaper than other mei tai style carriers).  Not bad on my back.  Can ball it up and shove it in the diaper bag.  Cons = harder to put on than Bjorn/Ergo, not as good as the Bjorn for facing out, not as good on the back as the Ergo.2) Baby Bjorn (I have the Bjorn Active): Pros = My baby LOVES facing out when awake, and this is hands-down the best carrier for that.  I put up with back pain to keep my baby happy.  Cons: Not as good as the Wrap and Tie or Ergo for facing in/sleeping.  Hurts my back to wear it for long (baby now ~15 lbs).  Expensive.3) Ergo: Pros = Quick and easy to put on, perfect for baby facing in/sleeping, cute little hood to put over her head to block out light while sleeping, AWESOME!!!! for my back.  Cons = Expensive, baby can't face out.  (My baby doesn't much like facing in while awake but she's getting used to it.)When I go out, I usually take both the Ergo and the Bjorn with me in the car, and then pick whichever one is appropriate for my baby at the moment.  If you have enough cash to drop on both (or better yet, can get them used or hand-me-down), get both and skip the Wrap and Tie.  If you only have enough $ for one carrier, the Wrap and Tie might work.*****final update--others have commented on the baby's face being smushed into their chest in the facing-in position.  I haven't had a problem with this, but I frequently check my baby's neck position to make sure that her chin is tilted up a bit and her nose is pointing up a bit.  It's easy to look down at her and reposition her head when appropriate.  Also, I usually have her in with the binky in her mouth, which keeps her face off my chest as well.",5

Ingenuity Moonlight Rocking Sleeper - Lullaby Lamb,"We gave this enchanting ensemble to Cindy, our neighbor, four months, 13 pounds.  She fits easily into the rocker and we think she will  able to use it up to 15 pounds. However, the direction warn against putting the baby in the rocker when he or she starts pushing up. The rocker is definitely designed for small babies that are not yet at the crawling stage. The unit is very easy to assemble. It is light weight but very sturdy, an advantage because it is easily moved around, a big plus when going to Grandma's. The interior is very soft and plushy and the rocker is definitely high quality.We hear Cindy went bonkers when tucked in the rocker for the first time, grabbing at the intriguing plush mobile shapes above her head. We are waiting for a full report from Cindy's Mom as regards the baby's reaction to all the nuances this unit provides. Stay tuned! But so far we've received nothing but raves.",5

"Bumbleride Indie Twin Stroller, Lava","We definitely splurged for this stroller after hearing so many great things about them.  When I was pregnant with our second and was going to have 2 under 2 years old, I started asking every mom I saw about how they liked their double stroller.  The only really positive response were from people who owned this one, or the Bob (people said the other side-by-sides were too wide and awkward, or the front-to-back/sit-and-stands were too long).  I didn't see a lot of these out there - the Bob is definitely more prevalent - but the main Bob complaint was the heaviness of it.I didn't give it the full 5 stars for a couple reasons.  There is a cup holder that hooks to the side and you can't fit through doorways when it's on - so it's a bit of the pain to be at the mall and have to take it and your drink off every time you're going into a new store.  It's also a bit tricky to open up, but maybe that's just the issue with double strollers in general.However it has more positives than negatives for sure.  The double wheels in front are awesome - this stroller is easily manipulated around with one hand ""like butta!""  I haven't had a chance to run with it yet, but also liked that feature that I didn't need a totally separate jogging stroller (our garage is already filled with plenty of baby stuff to not add another to the mix).  The overhead shades are also awesome - they cover so much more of the kids than any other stroller I've seen.  I also LOVE how flat the seats recline - my toddler happily lays down for a nap while we're out and about.  The lower basket is huge, although it's tricky for me to shove my diaper bag in there so I hang it off clips on the handlebars (petunia picklebottom).  We tried my infant in the seat, but now just fold up the footrest and stick her carseat in there - it would be nice to have a better way including a strap or something to secure her in - she doesn't move around and we feel safe walking with her like this, but if she gets any bigger and we start running, we'll put her properly in the buckled seat.  We also bought the wind/rain shield and haven't had to use it yet, but love that there was a custom one for it for when we need it.Overall, this stroller is pricey, but if you can afford it I would completely recommend it.  You get what you pay for and there are cheaper strollers out there for sure but you'll probably regret it.",4

This set is just as intense in color in person and the fabric is a nice density (it's not so thin that you can see through it when you hold it up to the light like some other bedding sets I have looked at).  It does have an appliqued giraffe in the middle of the quilt (the rest are printed on the material, but it's a high quality print in my opinion).  The shipping was also lightning fast and it arrived in perfect condition.",5

"Bright Starts Comfort and Harmony Bouncer, Vintage Garden","I loved this bouncer! Although it doesnt bounce very well when your little one kicks, it does make the coziest, softest little seat for them to fall asleep in or sit next to you. The little hanging animals are perfect for young infants because they are large and soft. The giraffe was the first thing my son ever tried to grab because it was large enough and close enough for him to realize he can touch things. The vibrations are a super plus for tired fussy babies, and the music is quiet and calming. If your looking for a bouncer that your baby can kick and bounce themselves in than this isn't the best one to get, but if your looking for the coziest little seat your baby can snuggle in, this is what you need! It reclines as well to be more like a bed. Very useful and easy to throw in the trunk if your visiting away from home.",5
"Blueberry Cotton 6 Piece Prefold Diapers, Unbleached, Large","Our first impression of this product was not great. These diapers pilled up instantly when we pre-washed them according to the instructions. We still used them, but the pilling was alarming at first. Perhaps if there had been some warning on a packaging insert or something to let us know this was normal, we would not have been as concerned.After a few washes, the lint/pilling all came off and never recurred, and the diapers were just as absorbent and functioned just as well as the bleached Chinese prefolds I had used on my older child.Our son is a heavy wetter and he soaked through a single diaper and had leaks out of the leg more than once (we used PUL covers), so we sometimes used fleece doublers that I sewed myself to take up the slack, especially at night. When he outgrew the newborn size, we decided to switch to AIOs, but if we were sticking with prefolds I would have gone with more of these, as they were the most affordable option I was able to find on Amazon. Diaper shipping can be steep, so Prime eligibility is a major consideration for us.",4
"JJ Cole Faux Leather Satchel Diaper Bag, Licorice","I just received this bag for my new little one on the way.  I've always disliked diaper bags that LOOK like diaper bags, so this was a great fit.  The faux leather easily wipes off and the inside lining is lime green, which is nice and gender neutral since I bought it before we knew what we were having.  The bag is more of a charcoal color than black, but I actually prefer it that way.  It comes with a messenger bag strap that makes it very versatile.  It is supposed to include stroller attachments, but mine were missing when my bag arrived.  It was easy to contact JJ Cole and get them replaced though.  While I haven't yet put the bag to use, I am super excited to start using it!",5

"Baby Jogger Car Seat Adapter Single, Mounting Bracket",I have Graco snugride car seat. It does not fit well on the adaptor. You can keep it on the adaptor but it does not secure it (like clicking)...you can lift up the car seat from the adaptor without delodging anything.

KidCo Configure Gate 24&quot; Extension,"This gate definitely met my expectations.  As we are temporarily living with my parents, our baby's room is in the living room.

"Evenflo Right Height High Chair, Georgia Stripe","We bought this high chair approximately 3 months ago, and we are very happy with it. It is very simple in the best sense of the word, and very functional. The tray is easy to wash, and so is the seat fabric. And it is perfect for our dining room, too, because of its compact size and colors, not as ""childish"" as those of some other high chairs (we chose Pink Georgia Stripe color for our baby-girl). Highly recommended!",5
"Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, Green/Blue","Love this chair. So easy to clean up and take anywhere if you wanted to. Extremely portable and light.

Skip Hop Treetop Friends Soft Activity Book,"Not sure what all of the hoopla is about this book.  It's an okay book but when it says activity book, I'm not sure what the activities really are with the exception of turning the page and chewing on the rubber leaf.  It's a cute book and all with the shape of a tree and it's different than what you would find in a normal square book.  I'll update more later after baby uses this if my opinion changes.",4
"Prince Lionheart BoosterPOD, White Base/Lemon",I bought this for my granddaughter to use.  It is much better than the hard plastic one my daughter found in a local store.

I wanted it to be durable.This cute little thing does just what I want it to do. Prior to getting this thermos, I packed cold lunches for my 5th grader everyday. Now I can send pasta, casserole, soups.... I pack his lunch between 6 and 7am; lunch is at Noon. And he tells me his food is ""really warm and yummy."" Worth the 14 bucks for the variety and interest it adds to my growing boy's lunch.",4
"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","I bought this bag (in black) before my son was born, he is now 4 months old,  and I have no regrets. It is cute, roomy, lots of little pockets to stash toys, diapers, bottles,  and what not, without looking like a typical diaper bag.  It is quite large, but I bring lots of stuff with me when we go out so it is perfect. I also love the stroller hooks, very convenient. A little pricey for my taste but in this case I'm glad I spent the extra money, love it!",5
"Philips AVENT 9 Ounce BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup, 1-Pack, Red","We have EVERY sippy cup ever made, but my exclusively breast-fed daughter was having trouble transitioning to a spouted sippy cup. I saw this cup in a magazine and bought it because it didn't have a spout, but also wasn't completely open. It is not spill-proof, but it is the only cup we have that she actually drinks from, instead of just chewing on the spout. I've only used it with water so far, because of how much it spills, but she's getting a lot more liquids with this cup than with any of the other sippy cups, so it's worth it. This cup is great for toddlers, but will probably require adult supervision until the child gets used to it.",4
"Luvable Friends 4 Pack Washcloths, Green","I've ordered a few different brands of wash cloths on Amazon and these were the ones I was most happy with. The binding around the wash cloths ensure the edges don't fray with repeated washings and the material is softer and thicker than the Gerber multi-pack. I've bought 6 sets already because there I use these to wash my son's face, for bath time, as dribble cloths. The colours are also lovely and vibrant.",5
Fisher-Price: Link-a-doos Open-Top Take-Along Swing,This swing is perfect to take anywhere. It folds nicely and unfolds with ease. My baby is 15lbs and it works at all speeds.

I have found Fisher-Price has the best products........I only wish I knew before I had my baby!!:),5
Sealy Baby Ultra Rest Mattress,"This mattress worked fine, but was not near the quality of some other baby mattresses we have owned.

"South Shore Furniture, Cotton Candy Collection, 4 Drawer Chest, Pure White","When you need furniture for your child's room, the last thing you want to do is have to spend a whole week working on it after work for an hour every day! The parts were very heavy, the directions very intricate, and many of the things don't fit together that well so after all the hard work, it looks like crap. I would've sent it back but the thought of taking it apart and having to ship it back would have sent me over the edge.",1

"Stork Craft Verona 4-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, Espresso","It's too bad I have to give this crib a three, because now that it is together, I would give it a five, but the assembly process was a pain. As some other people have mentioned, some of the parts did not line up properly and we had to use extra tools to make adjustments. I'm glad my father-in-law had the tools and know-how for this, or we would have had to pack up the whole (heavy!) thing, figure out how to repackage it, and return it, then hope the replacement parts fit. Some of the screws did not turn easily and it was hard to get them to go in without stripping them. I am not looking forward to figuring out how to deal with those when we have to unscrew and rescrew them when we convert the bed. It does look very nice, though, and feels sturdy.",3
"Baby Aspen My Little Night Owl Snuggle Sack and Cap, 0-6 Months","I love this snuggle sack, it's sooo adorable! And the material is so soft and nice to touch. It's well made and high quality. My only take is that the cap is too small to fit my 1mo infant who has a normal sized head, and this is supposed to last for 6 months.",4
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump,"I have the Ameda Purely Yours, a Madela Pump in Style, and a handheld Madela (Harmony, I think).  This is by far the best!  What I like about the Ameda:You can control strength of suction AND speed, independent of each other.  The Madela only has 1 knob that controls both strength and speed of suction together.I never had to wait for condensation to clear out of the tubing in the Ameda.  Madela tubing has a tendency to collect condensation.The pump also acts as a bottle stand, reducing the chance of spilling.The flanges that come with the Ameda are more my size and more comfortable.I never felt discomfort with the Ameda while letting down like I do with the Madela PIS.  I think this is because I can control suction/speed to mimic my son which is impossible with the Madela.The carry bag is much nicer with the Ameda.I had to call customer service due to it losing suction and did talk to a real person without any wait.  Since the pump was 2 years past warranty she offered a new base for $70.  Not bad but I was able to get the Madela instead.  It sounded like a better option but now I wish had gone with the Ameda.  The handheld is a great back up though.",5

"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","what a great chair! Love the kick stand that allows the chair to recline. My 2 month old looks super comfy and naps peacefully in it! And when she wakes up, toys all up in her face to play with! LOL! Its great!",5
One Step Ahead Secure Transitions Inflatable Baby Tub,"I am very pleased with this tub. I bought it for my 5 month old son, because at 25.5 inches, he was too long for his plastic tub when he was lying down, and the bottom was very slick, so it was a pain to sit him up and wash him.This tub is cushioned and colorful; he enjoys his bath time very much. The first couple of times I put him in there, he would just moves his legs back and forth, I believe he was in awe of the room he had.The only downside is, the tub does not fit under my bath faucet. Luckily, I have a detachable showerhead, so I just take that off, place it in the bottom of the tub and fill it up that way. Even if I had to fill the tub up using buckets of water, it would be worth it, because my son enjoys  himself so much.The drain cover has to be held to empty the tub, but that is only because the drain is rather large and sucks the cover back on as the water is emptying. It's not a problem for me at all, because I just let the baby play as I drain part of the water, while holding the cover and then flip the tub to drain the rest as I dry the baby.I REALLY like the suction cup used to hang the tub. I actually hang the baby tub in my shower on the opposite end of the shower head and I'm still able to take a shower with plenty of room left.",5
"Skip Hop Crib Mobile, Giraffe Safari","This is an adorable mobile, but it only works about half the time.  I even exchanged it for a new one, and it is flung to same thing. It will also only play music for a few seconds.  Thought the quality would be a bit better because it's made by skip hop!",3

4UCAM PAN / TILT Handheld 2.5&quot; Color Video Baby Monitor and 2.4GHz Wireless Camera - Day &amp; Night Video &amp; Audio Infant Nursery Monitor,"Purchased for our new nursery, picture quality isn't great and if you have wireless internet, cordless phones or use your cell phones alot it will interfere.  We've tried changing the channels, moving equipment and it is grainy with alot of lines still.  Not worth the money, but we're stuck.",3

"Babiators Unisex-Baby Infant Ops Junior Sunglasses, Black, Small","These are the cutest, coolest little shades out there. My son is truly the rockstar when he wears these, and thats all the time. The fit was accurate according to age. Just know that these are young childrens sunglasses and they are made of a soft plastic, yet besides the teeth marks my son likes to leave on everything, they are quite durable. I guess the extra money covers the one year warranty which covers loss or if they are broken. I was sold after that. I will buy more and recommend to others.",5
Kidco Hearthgate Extension - 8 Inches,"great gate extension, the gate is the best. It works great around my woodstove, so that my toddler cant touch it",5
Evenflo 1-2-3 Tea for Me Exersaucer,"I have nothing but positive things to say about this exersaucer. It's adorable, its the perfect size ( who has room for those gigantic ones?) I can actually throw this in my trunk and take it with me when we go visit family and friends. It keeps my 5 month old daughter more entertained then any other gadget so far. She will stay for 20-30 minutes at a time happily. She loves to jump in it as well.LOVE LOVE LOVE that the toys can be moved around and changed up if and when she starts getting bored of them. We already put in the musical teapot ( sold separately) and it is one of her favorite toys!This is the only thing that allows me time to get things done around the house right now. I can put my daughter in there and watch her jump and play and spin around while I do a load of laundry, clean the house, etc. It is a god send.  She was never too fond of the swing or bouncer. She prefers either being held ( obviously not convenient for getting things done around the house) or be in a standing position. This solves that problem wonderfully. I don't know what I would do without it!",5
Twooth Timer Twooth Timer,I bought this for my boys and it's wonderful.  The timer is loud so I get to hear it go off which ensures me that they are brushing for the required time,5
Clevamama Baby Formula Mixer,I wouldnt recommend this product at all... i bought this one because the one i had for some reason wont ship overseas..  This product works when it wants to. I'm better off shaking the bottle. Its sad to say but it was a waste of money.,1
Sassy Baby Sweet Dreams Crib Mirror,The mirrors image is ok. It pretty much looks like a fun house mirror (hope the baby isn't getting bad dreams). It is nice that you can change the angle of it by un-velcroing the back. If you have crib bumpers it is difficult to secure the straps because they are positioned low and the bumper will get in the way of them.,3

Graco Secure Coverage Digital Baby Monitor with 1 Parent Unit,"I've had this monitor for over a year now, and it works fine. The range is decent. The main downside I'd say is battery life. If you're going to use it overnight, you'll need to plug it in before you go to sleep, or it will start beeping at you in the middle of the night due to low battery.",4
Angel Dear Curved Animal Pillows (One Size : Pink Giraffe),I order this and the matching blankie for all my baby gifts.  It quickly becomes the child's favorite. I make sure to purchase an extra animal pillow for the older sibling.,5
"Malden Ten Little Fingers, Ten Little Toes Pewter Frame, Pewter",Really adorable frame. It matches any decor. Very unique.  Love the little feet and hands.  Very easy to change photos. I really dislike the metal slats that some frames have. They are so difficult to open.,5
Prince Lionheart On-the-Go Bottle Warmer,The warmer doesn't do a great job of warming a bottle from an ice pak cooler or the fridge. You must take the bottle out of the cooler 30-45 minutes ahead of time then once the chill is somewhat off the bottle heat up the heat pack from the warmer and apply it. Even then it just barely warms the bottle to luke warm.,2
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Newborn Rock N Play Sleeper, My Little Sweetie","My wife and I have a 6 week old and this has a been a wonderful purchases. Good enough that we bought a second one to live downstairs (the first one is next to our bed as a bassinet). We are able to set him down in this while he is still awake and rock him to sleep. It works alright on a soft surface and wonderfully on a hard surface where his motions while sleeping will induce it rock some and soothes him to keep him asleep.The vibration feature is a nice addition as it sometimes will help him go down when he otherwise would not. However, it depends on the day whether he likes that or not. The single D cell battery appears to have a very long life as we have yet to replace it in the model we had since birth and we are not very good at turning it off when we take him out of it after a nap.All fabric surfaces are easily removable and machine washable (and dryer safe). It also folds nicely and easily for travel and we take it with us when we expect to be a different person's house for any period of time.If we had to only pick five items to care for the baby with during this first few weeks, this would be one.",5
Gerber 12-Pack Flatfold Birdseye Cloth Diapers - White,"These diapers are PERFECT as burp cloths and mini-towels.  We used them as burp cloths when our daughter was an infant, and we continue to use them to wipe messy faces after meals, as well as to wipe runny noses during teething.  We keep them all over the house!  Be careful though - there are two types, one with padding and one without - make sure to get the ones without, as the ones with extra padding are useless in this capacity.  (They make great car shammies, though!)",5
"The First Years 4 Pack Ziploc Sippy Cup, 10 Ounce",Great sippy that flows well without too much of mess. There is a certain knack of getting the lid on correctly. If not threaded correctly it makes a nasty spill. Even with that I bought more since they work so well for us.,5
"Evenflo Big Kid High Back SI Car Seat Booster, Alexa","Right out of the box I loved this seat!! The material is nice and thick, with great padding. It is also very taut and does not detach from the seat when a child shifts around in it. It is also very simple to assemble. The bright green contrasts nicely with the black, and has a very modern look. The cup holders have an open side with elastic, leaving a lot of options for dink size, which is nice. It helps keep most any cup secure.  My son is very comfortable, and it has a number of height options, so he will be able to get a lot of use out of this seat. I love the lights that are built in! There are actually 4 lights, 2 on each side. It allows for more or less light, and also different angles of light from their positioning. The lights are simple to use, with a push on function. This is great when my son is sitting in the seat, so he can easily access and change the level of lighting without unbuckling. The speakers are nice as well, but the switch to turn them on is located on the back of the headrest. This means the child has to be sure to turn them on before buckling in. It would have been better if the switch was more accessible to the child from a buckled in position. Also, the cord to attach an Mp3 player is very short, possibly for safety reasons, but it makes it hard for the child to use the mp3 player to change songs or adjust volume.  It is nice that there is a pocket to keep the player in, however. It would also have been nice to be able to choose which side the cord for the speakers attaches on, but it is only to the child&#8217;s left in the seat. Since that is the side of the car the side is against in my car, it can get a bit squished. Lastly, the thread for the seatbelt is open along the outside of the seat, with a small notch to secure it. It is constantly popping out when unbuckling, so it makes it difficult to have to rethread it every time my son gets in his seat. I have had other evenflo seats, and they all threaded with the opening on the inner part of the seat, which I believe is a better design. Overall, it is a wonderful seat that is stylish, comfortable, and has some great extras!PROS:Great lookComfortablePadding stays on securelyMany height optionsElasticized cups to keep drinks secureLights built in, easy access and on/offSpeakersCONS:Speakers can&#8217;t be turned on while buckled inShort cord for mp3 playerCord can only be on the child&#8217;s left sideThread for seatbelt is on the outer part instead of the inner, making the belt pop out often",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,My son got this for Christmas and he loves all the cars.  His favorite is the fire truck.  He plays with it for a while.,4
Imse Vimse Organic Cotton Training Pants - Kiss The Frog Junior+,"They do seem to work a little better than Gerbers training pants.  Gerbers seem to hold a small trickle, while the Imse Vimse pants will temporarily hold in a full accident.  While I found Gerbers to be perfectly adequate for my first two children, my youngest tends to be so absorbed in her play that she sometimes misses her body's cues.That being said, if you are looking for something that will hold in a full accident for any extended length of time - these are NOT what you are looking for.  These will resist leaking long enough for you to remove them before they soak your child's clothing.  (Once you see that ""look"" in your toddler's eye - you'll have maybe a minute or two.)They are not for bedwetting, will not keep a car seat dry, etc, etc, etc.  These are for children who are beginning to show some bladder and bowel control.As for their design - they are very soft and I'd imagine are comfy.  The sizing is accurate.  They hold up well in the wash.  My daughter was so excited to wear these and wants them to stay dry as she loves wearing ""real underwear"" with animals on it.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"He loves being on this mat. He's not fond of tummy-time, but the toys definitely help. He started reaching for the toys with an open hand at 2 months! I've been told this is pretty early. He also enjoys being on his back and looking at the lights and butterfly mobile. The mat has a lot of neat little quirky things like a zebra tail that sticks up, some ribbons on the sun, and things like that. The music that plays is pretty cool too. Jungle-y, but not annoying at all. This is a great developmental toy, and I would definitely recommend it.",5
Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,"With all the rave reviews, I figured this was the product for us.  Boy was I mistaken.  I read most reviews and tried all the tricks, suit case was full and it never was tight enough.  I have a Britax Roundabout 55 and was using a 20"" carry on bag.  After several attempts, it still was not working.  We ended up not bringing any car seats, rented them from the car place and worked like a charm.  I do not think it would have been wise trying to push this through the airport.",1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"The motor is a bit on the loud side and the sideways swinging back and forth was too fast for my little one at first, but at about 2 months of age, he began LOVING it.  He was born 6 weeks early and I was concerned that he was so little in it, but the padding is great and he was fine and didn't slump.  At first he didn't care about the mobile and lights, but the swinging helped him sleep and I was able to get a shower every day!!  Now he LOVES the mobile and lights, too.  In fact, he likes them enough that even when he isn't sleepy, he will sit quietly and watch them while I grab my shower, put away laundry, etc.  It does take up a fair amount of space and I only use it upstairs in my Master Suite's sitting room.  I am considering moving it downstairs, but the lights won't be prominent if I do.  We received this as a gift from his grandparents - I just wish he wouldn't outgrow it since it costs so much.",5
"Natursutten BPA-Free Natural Rubber Pacifier, Orthodontic, 0-6 Months",i was tired of pacifiers that had a hollow center cavity that would fill with water while cleaning (or spit-up!!! gross)and take forever to dry.  i live in a humid climate and they would get stinky and moldy quickly.  this binky is made of one piece of plastic so its much easier to keep clean.  the only down side - it smells like a condom.  either the smell goes away or i'm used to it.  but it is still the best binky.,5
"Orbit Baby Stroller Seat G2, Mocha","In all of my Orbit reviews I rave about the amazing fabrics used in the seats and this is no exception! Only the greatest chemical free materials for your baby! Beyond that the 360* rotation is priceless!  Traveling through Disney, the zoo or the aquarium is a breeze with the Orbit function of this seat!  Turn your little one to face the action in seconds. Easy to rotate, and recline with the greatest hood ever with the ultimate sun protection!  This seat is the best way to use your orbit stroller frame after retiring your infant seat!",5
Bla bla kids Licorice Doggie Doll,Our toddler loves this doggie doll. He sleeps with him every night and uses him as a body pillow and a snugly comfort pal. Licorice washes well and has held up to over 7 months of snuggling and we think will handle many more months if not years. Pricey but worth it to us!,5
Nook LilyPad Playmat - Lawn,"I absolutely LOVE this playmat for my baby.  I have been laying her down on it since she was a few days old.  I love that it is organic- and it's so soft and plush.  Not an eye-sore like so many other playmats out there.  She loves tummy time on it, too.  When she is older it will be a great mat for a cozy corner with pillows!",5
"My Brest Friend Original Pillow, Bluebells","This pillow really worked for me. It provides great back support while breastfeeding. As other reviewers mentioned though, there was a pretty strong smell upon removal from the packaging. I hung it near an open window for a few days and that seemed to help. It did make me suspicious about the foam and wonder if the smell was caused by some sort of toxic chemical? Also the cover appears removable via a zipper but looks like a pain the butt to remove for washing. Overall, based on functionality i would give 5 stars but due to the smell and ease for washing i gave 4 stars.",4
ifavor123 Sticky Bellies Baby Onesie Monthly Milestone Stickers (Oh Sew Handsome 1-12 months),"We love these -a must gift for new parents! So cute to see them change, order right away because it came with a &#34;just born&#34; sticky too!!",5
"Live every moment,Laugh every day,Love beyond words Quote Wall Vinyl Sticker New Wall Decor Art Removable Mural Decal Letting Quotes Life (35x60cm, Black)",This product wasn't the best because they send it to you folded so when you put it up on the wall the creases are still in it. Therefore it will not stay down. I don't really recommend this product.,3
Sassy Happy Hippo Bath Shower Spray,"This product seemed like a great idea, yet is complete junk! It has instructions to fit it onto a tub faucet; so I disagree with a previous review stating it's not designed for that. It claims it will work & shows exactly how it should be done. Four adults, one being a plumber, have followed the instructions word for word & could not get it to work properly. Basically, we threw our money in the trash with this purchase.",1
Petit Tresor Nesting Removable Wall Decals,So cute in my granddaughters nursery! Really adds to the room and looks so cute with the whole set!  She has the whole set now and this is a perfect addition.,5
Graco SnugRider Elite Stroller &amp; Car Seat Carrier,"I love the lightness of this stroller frame, the small size also means that I can navigate through narrow doors and aisles easily. Clicking on the car seat is a breeze, opening the stroller and removing the car seat is a little trickier but certainly not a pain once I figured it out.However, the design of the storage basket can certainly be improved. The first time I used the stroller, I placed the diaper bag in the stroller before clicking on the car seat. Later,I realized that the diaper bag does not fit through the small opening at the side of the storage bag so I had to remove the car seat to access the bag. This is not fun when the baby is screaming in the seat for the milk.",3
Arms Reach Co-Sleeper brand Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,"I am looking for a size comparison on the mini and original co-sleepers.  We got our daughter the original for our granddaughter, and they love it.  My questions are:  should I get the mini sleeper for their visits to us?  How much actual sleeping space inside the bed do I lose by not getting the original size?  How large of a baby, how old a baby can sleep in the mini?The cost difference isn't an issue, it is the sleeping area in the bedroom that I worry about.  I  don't want Emma to  outgrow the bed in 6 months because I chinzed on a couple of inches.  I plan on purchasing the bed in a few days so is anyone can give me some insight, I'd appreciate it.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"10/21/08:  I was so excited when the swing arrived today in the mail.  My 11 day old enjoys car rides, so he will hopefully like a swing!  But then I spent thirty minutes assembling it to discover that 1) the motor is bad and 2) the seat tilts ~20 degrees to the right as mentioned by previous reviews.  The swing has the same (slow) speed at all settings and clicks loudly.  I'm returning it and buying a different swing.Edit added 08/04/12: I called Fisher Price right after my first review (10/08) and they send me a brand new motor (top part) for the swing.  When I called their 800 number a human in Buffalo NY answered the phone, diagnosed the problem with the swing, and had the replacement part there the next day.  This swing is still going, on its third family, after more than three years of swinging.  It is super.",5
Inclined to Sleep,We have found this product to be excellent for our baby boy. He typically has indigestion and a lot of gas. This helps to keep the milk moving down and get the gas out! Also has proven to be great as a 'co-sleeping' device to keep our son protected (stabilized)while nursing overnight in our bed. We would highly recommend the purchase and it's well worth the money.,4
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count",I used to buy these bags and was very happy but recently they started making them so thin that they break even before usage. No longer a good product unfortunately.,1

Magic Bumpers Portable Child Safety Bed Guard Rail 48 Inch - Set of Two with Duffel Bag,I purchase two of this as I have two year old twins. We have lots of sleepovers at Nana and Papaw's house. These are light weight and seem very durable so far.,5
"Baby Jogger City Select Single Child Tray, Black","I got this for our second seat.  My daughter (almost 4) has the belly bar and I was going to get them both the tray, as these days it helps to have snacks when they're contained and the tray has a place for food and drink.  My daughter was satisfied with the bar and the 'Brica Deluxe Snack Pod' setup and didn't want the tray (she doesn't like change) so I only ordered one.  Good thing, because when in tandem, and both seats facing the same way only one will allow the tray to open.  This is because the tray swings outward, while the bar swings upward.  When they are both facing forward, the tray won't open on the top seat (hits the front seat), when both facing backward, the bottom seat becomes difficult.  Overall, I'm happy with the purchase because my son does like it and it's easier for him than the pod would be, but the design is limiting and I'm glad I only needed one.",3

"Consider Yourself Hugged 50&quot; x 60&quot; Stadium Blanket, Chocolate/Pink","I purchased two of these blankets as gifts, one for my daughter in college and one for a friend that watched my pets as a thank you gift.Both recipients love their blankets and think they are awsome.  Very comfy to have around the house and easy to take along to a game.  Great blanket to leave in the car in winter for kids to use while the car is warming up.The blankets are holding up well to a lot of ""abuse"" from two big dogs and raucous kids.Makes an excellent thank you gift and the idea behind the company is a powerful one that really speaks to how much you appreciate the help from a friend or loved one, or just because you are thinking of them.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,"We just finished putting it together and I agree with the other poster who says it doesn't swing much.  It hardly goes 3 inches off center, no matter what the speed setting is.  I think there must be a manufacturing defect because the swing just doesn't move as much as I remember the one in the store moving.  We got ours to swing a little faster on occasion and if you let it warm up long enough, but so far I am disappointed.I like the music, but the controls are definitely lacking.  The controls feel cheap and it's difficult to click them into the place you intend because the settings are so close to each other.I am thinking there is a problem with the motor/controls and will be revisting Babies R Us to see if I need a new motor.UPDATE: I did find that the first swing was defective.  The replacement swing is much quieter and actually swings.  If your swing makes a clicking noise, take it back to the store!I'd rate this swing a 3.5 or 4 now.  I love the plug in feature, but I still have gripes about not being able to cycle through the music.  The buttons themselves can also stand to be improved.  Finally, it would be nice if the seat had more recline options.",2
"Sunshine Kids Soft Wraps Car Seat Harness Pads, Grey/Ivory",In general we are happy with this product and would recommend it. We have used it both with a Graco Infant Safeseat and a Sunshine Radial and from the looks of it these should be compatible with most if not all straps. Here are the pros and cons in our opinion:Pros:Very soft and offers good protection between the strap and the child's neckStrap moves easily through itCons:One side has huge labels on it. So not really reversible unless you cut those labels.The velcro strips are big and unwieldy. Could have been better designed.The straps get twisted within a little more frequently than what we have experienced in the past. Easily fixed though.,4
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","With my son, I was a HUGE fan of the diaper champ.  I've now tried the Diaper Genie with my daughter.  Both designs work very well, in my opinion, and both have their pros and cons.The Diaper Genie wins out in odor control, in my opinion.  We put the pail in our master bedroom, where my daughter was changed most of the time, and believe me, odor control was a big issue.  The Champ was equal in odor control for about six months, at which time I started noticing leaking odors when the top was flipped to cycle the diaper down.  I like that this Genie pail has a foot control.  The Champ requires cranking a handle back and forth, which not only allows the possibility for odor issues but also sometimes individual wipes jam the system if they are put in separately.The Champ wins out in ease of refills.  It uses a regular kitchen trash bag - open the unit, grab the bag, replace and you're set.  The Genie requires its own proprietary bags, and to me those get expensive depending on how 'productive' your little one is.  It also has a few extra steps to change the bag, but I imagine this is why the odor control is superior with the Genie.Both units are about the same price, as they fluctuate five to ten dollars depending on store and sales.  If odor is the main issue, I'd recommend the Genie.  If ease of changing the pail and getting refills is a concern, the Champ is also an excellent product.",4
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","If you are a person that moves a lot in bed, this pillow is huge, heavy and too high for my like, although it can be use in different positions.  I am hoping to get a better use of it when the baby comes.",3

Carter's Just One You Musical Monkey 15&quot; tall - Pink,My 4 month old loves this monkey. She likes to fall asleep with it for her naps and at night for bed. It is NOT worth $45 though. I bought this at Target before she was born. It didn't cost much more than $10. To try to sell this for that much money is disgusting and highway robbery.,1
Beco Baby Butterfly II ORGANIC Carrier In Espresso,"I just purchased the Butterflly 2, thinking it looked so similar to the ergo, yet prettier. I used my Ergo for the past 6 years this is my third baby. He is 8 months and my Ergo is starting to finally fall apart.  I should have just ordered another one instead of buying the beco.You can't unbuckle the arm straps at all, which probably will make  it hard to take it off weather he is on my front or back. I thought It sounded better because of the fact you can buckle it the back strap then slide it over your head so the straps are lower on your back. yeah but then how the hell do you unbuckle it.Also Impossible to get the hood on when in back carry unless you have help.  NO pocket for storing things in front like your wallet.  The hood has to be taken OFF instead of just tucking it in a pocket. And probably the most annoying parts are all the safety features like the  added piece of fabric between you and the babe, and the buckles by the chest have to be opened with TWO hands not one. Complete pain in the ass to me.Well he just fell asleep on my back while I'm standing here typing this. We'll see if I can actually get him off of me.  Just get an Ergo. It is SOOO much easier to use.  (maybe this would be good for use with your first infant, all the extra infant inserts and safety annoying features might actually be reassuring to a first time baby wearer.)  I am not happy to say the least. I would return it if I could.",1
Thomas the Train: TrackMaster Stepstool,"I started potty training my 2-year old boy and bought the Thomas Step Stool for him to use to reach the toilet and the sink.  I gave 5 stars because he LOVES using it and I LOVE the quality of it.  To be honest, I didn't expect the quality to be so good for the priceI paid!  The plastic used was very sturdy and durable, the slip-resistant surface does what it's supposed to, the rubber used seems to be of good quality as well, and the design was really cute (and I think is also durable enough to not chip off or fade in a long, long time).  I have washed the step stool several times already!  We've been using it for quite some time now and am very satisfied with my purchase.  This will definitely last until my 2nd baby starts to potty train!",5
Kidsline Dotty Valance,I love this valance. I bought two for our daughters nursery and am very pleased. They do not look 'cheap' and have the cutest ladybugs on them (in PINK) which made it an extra bonus for me. I've washed them with no issues or fraying. They do need to be ironed afterwards though. Great product.,5

Comes with a volume button and a timer with decent times (I think 24mins and 45mins) the ones I had for my kids had 5min timers so I was going back into the room and setting them off all the time disturbing them.  My son did not want to give this away to his new little cousin.  You can't go wrong with this product.",5
Jolly Jumper Stroller Caddy - Stroller Handlebar Organizer,"We have a Phil and Ted's jogging stroller and it didn't come with cup holders. The Jolly Jumper is an absolute life saver, especially when at the mall or at the amusement park! The 2 cup holders can accomodate just about any cup size and the middle third compartment can serve as a 3rd cup holder!  Great affordable product - thanks Amazon!",5

Replacement 12V AC Adapter for 12V Medela pump in style and Lactina Breastpumps. 100V-240V worldwide input voltage. 80% lighter than Medela Original,"I used the original 12 Volt plug that came with my Medela Pump In Style Advanced breast pump for almost two years while breastfeeding my son.  Now since i've had another baby, the original one had exposed wires and stopped working, so I ordered this replacement one.  I wish I had this one from the beginning! It works great and it is SO much lighter than the original!!  Medela should be selling these with their pumps instead of their huge heavy ones.Pay attention when ordering a replacement power supply, though- they are not interchangeable between the 9 Volt and 12 Volt pumps- you need to look at which pump you have.",5
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Swaddle Blanket, Dino-Roar","I adore this swaddle blanket.  It is a full 47x47 inches.  It's soft, comes in a cute little pouch, and has a cute pattern.  I highly recommend all Aden and anais products.",5
Safe-er-Grip 17&quot; Bathtub and Shower Handle and Shower Foot Rest,Neither the shower handle nor shower foot rest worked on the tile or walls.  The shower foot rest did work in the tub and is convenient.  I have not been able to place the bathtub and shower handle any place in the bath tub/shower area where it will stick and stay.  It is useless.  I wish I had purchased them separately so I could send the bathtub/shower handle back.,3
Aidan Boudoir and Bolster Pillow Set,"I'm probably using these pillows beyond their decorative purposes, but the rectangle one needs to be scotch guarded because the leather(ish) piece is going to stain if it gets wet. And babies are a wet slobbery mess most of the time...:)",3
"[Award winning] Kidsme Food Feeder (Small size),  Blue/Yellow","This is great, it makes it easier for me just let my son snack on fruits when we have some. He does't feel left out and it make my job easier. It's not too messy either. Although I do wish I had gotten the larger one. My son is 7 months old and he does great with it. His favorite is when I put a few pieces of ice in there! Works like a charm, especially when he's teething.",4
"Kaboost Portable Chair Booster, Green","This is a well constructed device and may serve some kids very well.  In my case however with a 2 year old, the booster elevated the chair too high, so that my son's legs were right up against the bottom of our kitchen table.  There are two height settings on this chair booster, but even the lowest setting was too high for us.  For what it's worth, our 2 year old son is about average height, and our dining set was from a large furniture manufacturer: and fairly typical of the dining table and chair set the average household may have.",3
"Boon Catch Toddler Bowl with Spill Catcher, Orange/Blue","Nothing beats it. It loses its suction after about 9 months, but we use it multiple times a day and take it everywhere with us. We're about to buy our 3rd. Worth every penny!  It's been the difference between cleaning up all the food off the floor and watching my son struggle to pull it off his highchair tray- and he's strong! Ha! Parents=1 Toddler=0.",5
"Sesame Street Potty Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Toilet Seat Covers, 40-Count",These toilet paper covers are big as described but the tape strips are very small and hard to use.  Sometimes I can't even use them.,4
Bright Starts Bright Starts Take n' Shake Stroller Toys,My infant loves this toy. It vibrates when you pull the animal down and he laughs and laughs. Better than a DVD player and a fraction of the price:),5
Fisher-Price Disney Baby Lion King Peek-a-Boo Soother,"I love how the music plays a Lion King song, and the lights and movement keep my baby entertained. The only annoying thing about it is that when you turn the movement on, it makes REALLY loud mechanical noises. Its really irritating. I'm not sure if they're all like that or mine is just broken, but we usually have to turn the movement part off because its so loud it drowns out the nature sounds.",3
"Luvable Friends 6 Pack Washcloths, Blue","These are incredibly thin wash cloths, but I am ok with it because i will be using them as cloth wipes. I wouldnt like these for actual baths for my baby because of how thin they are. I prefer a wash cloth that is thick and more towel like than these",3
"Neat Solutions Baby Einstein Biodegradable Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemat , 30-Count","I bought this product to use when my husband and I take our son out to eat. I don't like for him to be touching/biting on the end of the table, so this makes a nice clean space for him to play on. It stays down pretty well, yet is able to come off easily and clean. I would purchase this product again.",5
"Davinci Jayden 6 Drawer Tall Dresser, White","We love it...This is exactly as advertised, and fits so well in our master bedroom in our cabin at the lake.",5
"Safety 1st Wide Doorways Fabric Gate, Natural",We ordered this because we had a very wide opening we needed to block off.  It was very easy to install and fit perfectly!It rolls up and stores in its own bag and doesn't take up much room at all.Highly recommend this gate!,5

Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack,"Cute, but a little awkward to use, cumbersome. Takes up too much space.Prefer the drying rack that looks like a grass mat.",2
"Skip Hop Zoo Bib, Dog","This bib has it all.  If I could give it 6 stars I would! It is cute.  Food doesn't stick to it or stain. It can be rinsed in the sink; and it will be clean, dry and ready to use for the next meal.  I'm not sure I would call it waterproof, but its at least water resistant enough to keep my little guy's clothing dry. It is big enough to his shirt clean too.  My six month old likes to chew on the ears while I get his food ready.  I also like that it closes on the side which makes it easier to get on and off one handed.",5
"HALO SleepSack Big Kids Comfort Mesh Wearable Blanket, Blue, 4T - 5T","I gave this sleep sack 4 stars based on what I knew I was getting-a polyester mesh sleep sack!  I'm not sure why people are giving bad reviews for not reading the title or description correctly (or at all).  I would love a cotton sleep sack to be made, but in order to stay within regulations for fire safety, it cannot be done in this larger size (only in the sizes intended for infants).It is lightweight and is great for the warmer weather we have been getting.  The fleece sleep sack is much warmer, so this is great for spring and summer.  The sack is HUGE on my 20 month, 35 in, 27 lb child.  (wears 24 mo clothing) I'm sure we'll be able to use it next spring.  The material right where the feet go through is a softer material than the mesh that the rest of the sack is made from.I love the big pictures in the top of the sack.  It is perfect for toddlers to identify and love.  My child does not like blankets, but insists on wearing his ""car sack"" or ""dino sack"" to bed.My only complaint is the tag- this goes for all of the sleep sacks we have owned- it's huge!  It is always flipping upside down, and tickling my son's neck.  The tag is a softer material, but I just don't like tags in young children's clothing.  To make this sack perfect, I would like a tagless version!",4
Simmons Kids Full Size Wood Bed Rails Lb Cherry,Only had to do very minor adjustments to the design to get it to work. Mostly having to replace a few of the screws and shave one of the cross slats down to fit properly.  Went together quickly and easily Then slide the cover over it and you are done. Even taking my time and a few trips to the workbench I had this together in about 10 minutes.The slat I had to shave down was literally too long by about 3-4mm. And was probably unique to the one I received.Better too long that too short.,5
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","We bought this blanket because our baby is easily able to wrestle his arms out of the SwaddleMe blankets which wakes him up. We like it that this blanket secures the arms, but the legs always get free, so we have to double swaddle him with a SwaddleMe blanket on top.  It also unwraps easily when I pick him up to feed him if he is not double swaddled because I can't tuck it well enough to make it stay.  Fortunately, it's wintertime, so we're able to do the double swaddle without him overheating.",4

"Carters Easy Fit Jersey Cradle Fitted Sheet, Blue","Great cradle sheet.  It is nice and soft and fits perfectly.  The jersey is great material.  I have only washed it once, but it held up fine in the washer and dryer.",5
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet, Celery","Seems to be made well. I washed it when it arrived and it held up nicely, no beading up or unraveling seams. The fabric is very soft. I have a wooden portacrib with the 1&#34; pad so this sheet is actually a little &#34;deep&#34; as it would fit a thicker pad, but it is staying on just fine because the elastic is tight, its just doesn't stretch tight .I am pleased with my purchase and would buy again.",5
Baby Buddy: Baby's 1st Toothbrush,I have twin girls (2.5) who have been using these brushes (now as supplement to regular toothbrush) since 6 months of age. Very useful to make sure their teeth are clean as the girls chew them like they are gum with a handle.  Teeth look great so I like the brush.,5
"JL Childress Wheelie Car Seat Travel Bag, Black",This was an easy and inexpensive way to travel with a car seat. It was light enough that my 3 year old daughter could pull it behind her while I had our other luggage. Both times going through security I didn't have to take the bag off the car seat. I highly recommend it.,4
"BABYBJORN Comfort Carrier - Gray, Organic","I purchased this carrier for increased comfort as compared to the previous Bjorn models. It is after all, called the Bjorn Comfort, right? I previously used the original Bjorn and liked it because my baby seemed very comfortable in it and the baby loved facing outwards, but found that the straps dug into my shoulders. So, for baby #2 I purchased the Bjorn Comfort based on the extra padding provided in the straps. At first, it was divine. The straps had extra padding and seemed so cushy and I loved this carrier. My infant fit so comfortably in it and I could really feel the difference of having the extra padding in the Bjorn Comfort. I walked all over NYC with my new infant, pain free. However, when the baby hit 6 months, the shoulder pain returned from wearing the Bjon Comfort. By the time the baby was 7 months and getting heavier, the plastic plate that holds the two straps together would ride up and dig into my neck. No matter how I tried to adjust the baby and the straps, that plate holding the straps together would dig painfully into my neck to the point that I felt like the baby was being supported and was essentially dangling by the strength of my neck alone so I had to stop using it. I have no idea how someone could carry a heavier baby with this carrier, and I would think that 18 lbs of baby is pushing it before the carrier's straps dig into your neck. Instead, buy another Bjorn with the lumbar support like the bjorn miracle!BABYBJORN Miracle Soft Cotton Mix Baby Carrier, Black/Silver",3
"BRICA Stay-In-Place Baby Mirror, Black",The product would not stick to the car window. Size is good. But if came off with the slightest bump or turn in the road.,1

Lucy Darling Shop Monthly Bodysuit Baby Sticker - Baby Girl - Branch - Month 1-12,I bought these monthly stickers for my friend's baby shower.  She is having a little girl and has very picky taste. These stickers were a perfect fit- they show the number clearly but are class and not too cutesy.,5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Jumperoo,"My baby boy adores his jumperoo. He has had the busiest legs from the day he was born and I knew that a jumperoo would be fun for him. I was correct. He has loved it since we bought it for him at 6 months old. 3 months later he still loves it and divides his time between it and his playpen when it's time for Mommy to get some work done. My only complaint about this jumperoo is the price. It really is terribly overpriced. Almost $100 for a toy that has 2 toys that flash red, a few repetitive tunes and some assorted movable toys around the round tray is just outrageous. If you find a cheaper jumperoo go for it, for my baby anyway it's all about the jumping and the little hippo flower he enjoys teething on, I think he would have been happy with any jumperoo.Another word of warning. The Precious Planet jumperoo does not fold up like the Rainforest jumperoo. I would have bought the Rainforest jumperoo if I had paid enough attention to the description. This is a big toy and will take up a lot of space if you have a small living room.",4
Medela Swing Breastpump,"I am a stay at home mom who wanted a good electric pump that would last, but I didn't need the full on double pump like the pump in style or similar type things as I did not need to pump every day. Most of the electric pumps that were less expensive had many reviews claiming they broke quickly, and I did not want to waste money on something that would break. This pump doesn't cost much more, and also has excellent reviews. It has worked great for me, is easy to clean and easy to use. I have not had any trouble with the flap part falling out mid pumping, so perhaps they have upgraded the product since that was an issue. It is a great mid-grade pump and at an excellent price. It was definitely worth the money for me. I've had it five months now and I've never had any trouble with it and have always been able to pump adequate amounts of milk with it. I'd recommend it to anyone who plan on only pumping once a day or less, but still wants a good electric pump.",5
"Gerber Birdseye 10 Count 3-Ply Prefold Cloth Diapers, White",I clean my eye glasses . its works great and dose not scratch them.just put in washer when dirty,5
"Sealy Sweet Pea 2-in-1 Maternity and Nursing Pillow, Cappuccino","I am only 5'4"" so I am not a tall person. This pillow is not as big as the picture seems. While it'll be good for propping me up, since it is very rigid and not very fluffy/squishy, it is NOT good for using to support your belly or in between your legs and forget about putting your head on it!! I'm keeping it only cause I am pregnant with twins and I predict bed rest in my future, so I can use it to prop me up or maybe set on my lap so I can have a bowl or plate of food in front of me.  Plan on buying that snoogle pillow or one similar.",2
"Gerber Training Pants 3 Pack, Blue/White, 2T",These training pants are a great way to wean you child off diapers.  It has the extra padding that regular jockey underwear doesn't have so its not as messy when an accident occurs.I wish they were easier to find.  I could only find them at Amazon.  No stores that I went to carried this item.,5
ReStik Race Ya! Wall Stickers,"Track works great.  Can pill and re-stick over and over, something I had to do to get my track right.  Would be nice if they included different lengths for straight-a-ways or maybe a few more packs of track.  Wish I could have a little bigger track, but don't need a second set.  Otherwise, great product.  You wont be disappointed in the quality.",5
Proudbody Baby Safe Ink Pads (Blue),It was very difficult to even get a small amount of inkless on my infants feet and hands and the print on white paper was very faint. It did was off very easily.,1
"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss Bodysuit, Cat In The Hat It's Fun To Have Fun, White, 0-3 Months",It is a great product and a great price. We have gotten several cat in the hat products and have been happy with all.,5
Kidkusion Kid Safe Banister Guard,"The good part about this item is that it's cheap, the bad is that it is junk. I don't know what I was expecting, but this is just a plastic sheet that you are supposed to punch holes in yourself and fasten to your railing any which way you can. After struggling with this thing for about 20 minutes, I was not confident my crafty and relentless little one wouldn't just tear it up and slip through. Highly not recommended. I ended up getting a sheet of white plastic garden lattice from the local Mega-Lo-Mart, cut it to fit, and fastened with zip ties. It looks OK, and more importantly there is no way she's busting through that without X-Men powers.",1
Easy Grip Handle Fork &amp; Spoon Set***Boy Colors***,"These are the best utensils we found for our kids.  We got them at Walmart (the Parent's Choice brand, but says Nuby in the fine print) for under $4 for the same set.  The handles are easy to hold for left or right hands, and the scoop is just the right size.  The ""spork"" isn't sharp enough to actually poke most foods to use as a fork, but I suppose it's better that way for little ones.  We loved these, but I'd suggest looking for a cheaper one, either search for Nuby or look at Walmart.",5
"Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Tower Chest, White","I bought this piece from Stork Craft while awaiting my newborn baby.  The first one they shipped was the wrong style and color.  So I had to wait two more weeks to get this product that when we put it together cracked and split at almost every screw hole.  The funny thing is, is that we have the matching crib that is built beautifully and sturdy.  This Changing table/dresser is not.",1
Meeno Babies &quot;Cool Mee&quot; Universal Bucket Seat Liner ~ Yellow,"I bought the light pink colored one for my friend's first baby girl at her baby shower party and she loved it!  It's really light, durable and you can even wash it so it'll constantly stay clean for your baby, especially in hot,sticky or muggy weather.  It's a good investment for your baby and as a simple but usable gift for a friend or co-worker. I would highly recommend it!",5
"Baby Doll Bedding Regal Port-a-Crib Bedding Set, Mint","Affordable mini crib set which is hard to find anyways, and here it is! It's decent, seems to be well made, and relatively soft. I had to buy the mini crib ruffle separately, but all in all it is a nice set at a great price.",4
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar",My son  started to teething since he was 4 month and this has become his first and foremost important things for him in his life. The doll is bit smaller than I thought but I guess he is OK with it. I ended up ordering dino one for daycare so he can keep his bear at home. Great product and the only downside is that I cannot change pacifier part. So I gave 4 stars.,4
"Sassy Baby Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary","Ok product for little bottle (4oz). Formula did shift from one cell to another, which defeated the purpose of the pre-measuring option. I eventually gave up on the option and bought a thermos to hold hot water and pre-measured formula into each bottle - it was a lot easier in the end.",2
The Potty Stool for Toddler Toilet Training Step Stool,I love this potty stool.  it gives my special needs daughter the ability to climb up by her self and security. It gives her stability while she is focusing on being potty trained and it gives her the ability to access the toilet by herself to reinforce independence.,5
Evenflo ExerSaucer Triple Fun - Jungle,"I spent a lot of time researching the different stationary entertainers out there and I am SO HAPPY I chose this one. My most important criteria for selecting one was 1) the seat needed to be low enough for my 4 month old's toes to reach the bottom (she is 24 in), and 2) there needed to be lots of interesting toys that my baby could reach. This exersaucer definitely meets these and has so many other great features. The toys are colorful and fun; half of them light up and/or play music. The separate floor gym that comes with it is a big hit with my baby, and I love that the exersaucer converts to an activity table for when my baby is older.",5
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Sleeping Bag, Star Light, Medium (Previous Model)","We typically use Halo sleep sacks, but read good things about the material of the A+A sacks and figured we'd give it a try. First, I have to agree with another review, the material doesn't wash well. More importantly, we woke up this morning to find our baby was completely out of the sack and wondered how a 6 month old could possibly do that. Turned out the zipper broke. That's really dangerous because it was bunched up and close to her head.",1
"Dreambaby Stroller Fan, White/Blue","Its a nice little fan.  A bit noisy, but gets the job done.  I wouldn't be surprised if it broke within the year, it's an $8 cheap fan after all.",4
Mommy's Helper Toilet Seat Lid-Lok,This is a good idea but putting it under the seat and over the ring is not a good idea.  The seat cracked and I had to buy a new one and they are not cheap.  It didn't take my great granddaughter very long to figure it out so it was all for nothing and I will not risk cracking another seat.  Would not recommend the product.,1
Dream On Me Toddler Bed with Storage Drawer - Cherry,"Quality was good, just the color was way off.  Was supposed to be espresso and was more like the cherry.  The boxes even said espresso so not that type of error.",3
"Baby Phat 4 Piece Bottle Set, Heart",It's very nice plus the good discount price. It is a gift for my twins nieces. They would love them,5

Disney Cars Folding Potty Seat,"We got this portable potty seat to take with us on a trip out of the country.  Unfortunately, the seat didn't provide stability when our son sat on it.  The ""gripper"" feet didn't hold on to the seat as it said it would so the seat moved around on the toilet lid and scared my son.  He won't sit on it now.  He'll sit on the regular potty and hold on to the potty or to me instead of using this portable potty seat.",1
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Clear Bottle without BPA, 8 Ounce",Nipples suck! Slow flow doesn't stay slow for long. More like a fire hose. Bottles don't work well with higher quality nipples.,2
Chomp Baby Pacifier,Got this for baby shower.  My son loved it.  Can't wait to see it on.  Beats those silly diaper tower gifts any day.,5
bumGenius Diaper Sprayer,I think this works well and helps incredibly with cloth diapers.  I don't think I would cloth diaper without it.  I love how it has an adjustable pressure so you can control the force of the spray.  It does a great job getting the poop off my son's diapers.  You have to remember to always turn the valve off after each use.  I also press the button to release what left over water there may be after I turn off the valve to prevent drips. I haven't had any problems with any leaks.,5
Safety 1st Railnet,Brilliant product. Very easy and quick to install. Would definitely recommend this product. Very reasonably priced compared to other options.,5

Mommy's Little Bear Open Edition Giclee Wall Decor,When I received this so cute painting....I was so happy.  I have been looking for sweet things to put up in my baby boy's nursery but everything is for girls!  To have an original piece of art in our nursery is so impressive to all of our friends. The price is very fair for an original piece of art.We plan on ordering more on the artist's website.,5
"Clevamama ClevaFoam Baby Pillow, Cream",It is super soft. My almost 4 mo old loves to sleep on it. I feel good knowing she is sleeping flat on her back while using this pillow.,5
Starting Small Frog Novelty Hamper - Green,"Very cute hamper and it worked great for about 6 months, then the mesh on the side starting tearing. The little plastic bars (4) that are supposed to keep the sides apart started bending when carrying it to the laundry room. Keep in mind our son was only about 4 months old at the time when these started bending and we would only let it get about half full before washing clothes. At about 6 months of use the mesh sides were tearing and one of the plastic bars actually snapped in half. Not sure how anyone could say that it could hold any amount of toys and be carried around because it would do the same thing then. It was cute while it lasted but I'm glad it wasn't me that spent money on it.",2
Philips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kit,"these work well to convert from ameda to avent, but just keep your bottles upright as even a slight tilt seems to cause leaking when you take the bottles off.  and all moms know that each drop of liquid gold is priceless!!",3
Munchkin Lulla-Vibe Vibrating Mattress Pad,I found this to be a useless product.  It made a ton of noise and the sound it made was a little unnerving.  It was anything but soothing for a baby who is trying to sleep.  The pace of vibration is way too furied.,1
"Boon Swap Baby Utensils,Blue/Orange","Okay, that sounds like an exaggeration, but I have 4 kids spanning 16 years.  Every baby spoon I have found was short handled and most had spoons that were too large and round for a baby learning to eat solids.  This baby spoon is perfect, from the length of the handle down the the size of the spoon.  You have to try it, you won't be sorry!",5
"Munchkin Travel Bottle Warmer, Gray",We bought this before vacation bc my son was picky about his warm milk. I was very pleased with this product.  It takes a little bit to warm the milk. So like anything with a little one you have to plan ahead.,5

C.R. Gibson B is for Boy Keepsake Memory Book of Baby's First Year,"The Keepsake Memory book is ok.  It was not what I expected.  I purchased a keepsake book for my daughter back in 2005 and it was much nicer than this one.  Just the quality was not what I was looking for.  But for the price, it is ok.",2
"Dena Happi Tree Plush Pillow, Pink",Good size pillow and very cute!  My daughter loves it!  I just wish the Happi bedding came in larger sizes for normal bed (not just cribs).,4
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I have both this and the Medela Easy Expressions pumping bra. The adjustable sizing of this one makes it so much more comfortable than the Medela bra. Both work great as hands-free pumping bras, allowing me to answer emails, etc. while pumping, but given that I often just put the bra on over my nursing tank/nursing bra, I needed something with a little flexibility in sizing. This is perfect. I was concerned that the XS-M size would be too small (I'm a 36D) but it works great with room to spare. It is slightly bulkier than the Medela bra, so if you were going to wear something under your clothes, that might be a consideration. But for wearing just to pump, this bra is definitely my go to hands free bra.",5

"Merino Kids Baby Sleep Sack For Babies 0-2 Years, Banbury","I hesitated a while before buying this blanket, mainly because of the price.I wanted some natural alternative to the normal fleece blankets, my daughter sweats a lot in fleece.I bought this when she was approx 2 months old, now she's  4 and I've been using the blanket almost every night.I'm very satisfied, it's high quality, it fits her right on her upper body even if it's long (it will be good for a long time on her).It opens and zips easily.It's soft and keeps her dry and warm.I washed it without any problems in the washing machine.(woolite detergent and cold water).It dried beautifully on the drier's low setting.Overall I'm very happy with it.",5
MobiCam Audio Video Baby Monitoring System,"I have been using this product for 15 months...I have twins so I have been using two cameras and one base since day one.  I am on my third and fourth camera because the night vision went out on both of my monitors and I am in need of a new monitor because there is ""dead spots"" in the volume dial.I really, really wanted this monitoring system to work.  I bragged and told everyone I knew how GREAT this product was in the first 6 months that I had it.  But that was about how long the honeymoon period lasted.  Then I had to purchase a new monitor because it was actually cheaper to buy a new camera then it was to ship and pay to have the old one fixed.  Then a month later the other camera quit working.  In both the camera the night vision quit working.  So you could still use the cameras as long as you didn't turn the lights out...which of course doesn't work with babies that are trying to sleep.A couple months ago the power cord for the monitor quit working, luckily I was able to use a power cord from one of the two old cameras I still had in a drawer.  And now the sound keeps messing up, I have to find just the right spot for the volume dial because of ""dead spots"" where you NO sound.  And sometimes the sound will just go away, I turn it off and back on and then it is fine.  But during the middle of the night the last thing I need is for the sound to stop working.Like I said I really wanted to LOVE this system, but it has worked really really hard to make me hate it!  And the I have tried to get customer service from the company and have had no luck.  So it looks like I will get to spend time finding another monitoring system that hopefully will work better for me and my twins...but if I were you I would NOT waste my time or money on this system.",1
Munchkin Snail Stacker Bath Toy,"First, the little snail holder doesn't float very well, it just topples over.  The rings are ok, but my son doesn't enjoy it as much as i thought he would, especially since he LOVES his wooden ring stacking toy.  I wish the rings were a little more interactive.  The squeeze flower on top doesn't really do anything, and it doesn't attach to the top.",3
Kolcraft Pure Sleep Therapeutic 150 Crib Mattress,It fit fine when I tucked in the padded edging for the crib. There is no standard crib size every cribmaker is slightly different a match in size is just dumb luck. Got it fast and wrapped in plastic which is good for our compulsive cleanliness. It's just the right comfort level.,5
"Munchkin Fun Ice Teether Babies, Styles and Colors May Vary",After my son started teething he preferred soft plush toys to chew on rather than the plastic teethers. So we decided to try this one since it had both. I also decided to try this over others because it was machine washable and with two dogs and a 2 year old machine washable is great. He loves it and I am going to order two more just for the car and one for when I am washing the others. He is really soft and the plastic parts have withstood his two little teeth. I don't like the ring it comes with because of the opening but I just switched it out with the little linking rings.,5
Dr. Brown's Double Electric Breast Pump,"I am a third time breastfeeding mother....so, this isn't my first rodeo.I received this product in a makeshift, opened, tampered with, without original packaging...WITHOUT safety seal box!!!!!!!!!!!  If you receive this item NOT in it's original packaging assume it has been USED!  This is a level 2 health code validation!!!!!  (spoke to associates at the Dr. Brown Corporation) ...and could cause health problems to your newborn!Disgusting and unbelievable that such a company would take that &#34;risk&#34; and resale this item.To make matters worse, I ordered a SECOND one and....the SAME thing happened.  Please...please, buy elsewhere.",1
"Dreambaby 24.5&quot; Gate Extension, White","looks great! i love the variety of sizes the extensions come in. Follow the installation instructions- went up fast and easy.  Only con I have is that the bars could be a bit closer together.  My two year old got his leg stuck in between the bars- luckily he's a live and learn kind of kid, so he won't be getting stuck again.",4
Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,Brought it in advance for my newborn little boy. The wife love using it in the middle of the night for breastfeeding. This is my second one in two months. The wife dropped it so many times in the day time moving it around in the bedroom three of the five colors stopped working. We only had blue and green. Blue is the brightest at night but when the baby wanted to go back to sleep it was to much light. The red color is bright enough to see around the room to move around but dim enough for baby to sleep. Since we no longer had red we had to buy a whole new one. Now the wife and I both have one on our night table.lol,5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"I've went through researching most of the baby monitors and I finally bought this one. We have an extra add-on camera paired to our monitor. This is one of the basic monitors that you can get, but for the price you're going for better value. The most important criteria for us was the video quality, and this monitor lives up to what is claimed. It's got clear images and smooth video. It's alot of fun being able to watch our daughter when we aren't right next to her. We've caught her putting things into her mouth that she wasn't suppose to! Lots of fun, also very safe.",5
Cloud b Baby Turtle with Quiet Rattle,"This rattle is adorable! It's the perfect size for tiny hands, and although my baby hasn't reached the age where he can actually hold things yet, he likes to hug it to his chest and he likes looking at it when I make it rattle. Aside from it being a rattle, it's really well made and is just too stinkin' cute! We collect turtles, so this is a baby toy that will probably remain out with our collection instead of getting packed up once the baby outgrows it.",5
"CoCaLo Jacana Plush Giraffe, Ecru/Brown","Looks cute with the Jacana themed nursery...and additional nice touch.  Good quality, and I'm sure it'll get snuggled with as the baby gets bigger.",4
"Nat and Jules Nightlight, Blue Ollie Owl","Overall this is a very cute nightlight and we are happy with it. It's going in the bathroom for now but will eventually go in our infant son's bedroom. The light seems fairly bright for only having a 7 watt bulb. My only criticism is that the &#34;paint&#34; or dye job on the plastic is less than perfect which makes it look a little cheap. We expected more for a sixteen dollar nightlight. Also, it has an on/off switch, but for the price it would be nice if it also included a light sensor so that it could turn on and off automatically.",4
Set of 26 ~ ABC's Rubber Duckies,These will be great to use with my preschoolers for learning the alphabet. I just wish the letters were a little darker.,4
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"Nice stroller. Good quality. Just be carefull if You are expecting a light stroller, of course its heavier than an umbrella and bigger as well. Over all, vera satisfied",5
MyHome Glow in the Dark New York City Light Wall Decals Wall Stickers Wall Art Decals Home Decoration (170*45cm),"The glow in the dark window lights come in the form of a roll of individual rectangle stickers that you must stick yourself to all the windows.  It is a very time consuming process, but it looks great.  I love the way it turned out on my wall and the stickers glow vibrantly in the dark.  I use a blacklight in my room every once in a while and the glow in the dark windows illuminate very nicely. This is a good product but requires some assembly and all the instructions are in another language that I could not decipher.",4
"The First Years Ultra Folding Booster Seat, Cappuccino",These are perfect seats for my grandkids. This is the third one that I bought. I love the fact that they fold in half and I can keep it in the trunk and always have it when I need it.Every grandparent should have one,5
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Soho Square",We have had for about 2 months with no issues. It is light and sturdy. It also stands I it's own when fully collapsed to save space.,4
"Britax Second Seat for B-Ready Stroller, Red","Good updated buckle and space saving design. It is smaller than the top seat. The sun shade is also shorter, but due to the positioning of the other seat, it blocks the sun for the bottom seat. I definitely did not see my toddler using it very often, but she likes to use it. Be careful if a toddler does use it though, it makes the stroller bottom heavy and can tip back.",5
Peg Perego Aria Twin Double Stroller in Toffee,"I love this stroller!  I hunted high and low and it came down to the Aria Twin or the Maclaren Twin Techno.  Both were great but we settled on the Aria Twin because of a few things.  Ultralight weight...I am 5'1"" and this is easy to fold and load in to my SUV.  Also, it has a great basket underneath, steers easily with one hand and each seat reclines to almost flat.  It also has a tray that does two things, keeps the kids in the stroller and it's easily utilized for snacks, etc.  When we tested the Maclaren my older daughter who is 3-1/2 kept on leaping out of the stroller because it did not have a tray.  Of course you can buckle them in repeatedly but it can become a pain if you are using this stroller at let's say the mall or Disneyland like we do.I've read many reviews on this stroller and I must say that if you are looking for a ultralight weight stroller with great style and durability, this is the only choice.  We used this stroller traveling to Maui just recently and it was perfect.  We also use this stroller at Disneyland frequently (we have annual passes and go almost every weekend)and it definetely gets and A+!  We also have a Graco DuoGlider and this is a 1/4 of the weight.  We enjoyed the DuoGlider, too but that was a beast!  Something like 35 lbs. without kids and stuff in it.  Yikes!  Try pushing that around for 8 hours at Disneyland!  The Aria Twin is a stroller well worth the money, you won't be disappointed.",5
"Sugarbooger Children's Closet Dividers, Pink Dot",These have come in very handy in organizing my little ones closet. I gave it 4 stars because I had to make my own labels. I didn't find the labels enclosed practical for organizing the closet.,4
"Bella Tunno Terry Bib, Coco Dapper Dot",This bib has been great for our 3 month old baby for use with spit up and drool.  It does curl a bit in the wash but straightens out with some gentle tugging.  We'd be buying these in bulk if they were not so pricey.  Definitely better than the bibs with all of the decals.,5
"Boon Orb Bottle Warmer,Green",Fits tommee tippee bottles.Auto off feature - which should come with any bottle warmer.Small but efficient.By far the best bottle warmer I have seen on the market for that price.,5
Levana Safe N'See Digital Video Baby Monitor with Talk-to-Baby Intercom and Lullaby Control (LV-TW501),"I read the other reviews prior to purchasing and was somewhat hesisant.  We also had the Graco video monitor as well and I was more used to the features of that one. I like the Graco one better.  The Graco one is shaped like a flip phone, so in the middle of the night, there is no light shining out of it to keep you up at night.  This one shiones light all the time.  It did not do that in the beginning, but now is the only way that it works. I feel that overall it is a really good product.  Everything works as described.  The only one item that I could complain about is a design flaw.  The sound quality of you hearing what is going on in your child's room is excellent, but the sound quality on the reverse side - the speak or music option that plays in your child room - It's terrible.  Like F-.  Also, the button to play music in your child's room is on the side of it - exactly where your hand would naturally go to pick it up, so numerous times, we have started the music in her room, only to watch her pick her head up to wonder what in the hell is going on after trying to get her to sleep.  Whoever designed this feature either does not have any kids or did not complete any testing on this feature whatsoever.",4
The Door Guardian Childproofing Lock Colors: White,"Excellent!  After installing one of these on the front door & garage access door, my 18 year old daughter (blonde) can no longer figure out how to sneak out of the house; score one for dad's around the world trying to keep tabs on their daughters!BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!  Her jackass boyfriend(s) can no longer get into the house, because the door guardian also serves as a very effective deterrent to thieves, thieves trying to seal your daughters innocents.  Again, score one for dads!HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANYONE W/ TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, ESPECIALLY BLONDES.",5
"Supergate Deluxe D&eacute;cor Metal Gate, Espresso","There are several things I like about this gate.  The one thing I do not like, is it has to be attached to the wall.  I like that it does not have to only be straight, it can be configured to best fit the space you need it for.  It would feel a bit more secure if it was on the ground - I had to attach it to the wall above my floor molding.  The gate is quiet - for anyone with kids who lets the gate crash shut behind them, it doesn't make the loud noise other gates can make.  The release button can take a bit getting accustomed to, but once you figure out the trick its easy to open.  The gate is a good height too.",4
HABA Discovery Block Set,"My biggest issue with these blocks was the quality of the ones we received.  One block had a crack running up the side, and we had to put it out of commission as soon as they arrived.  Terribly unsafe for a baby.The block with the bell and the one with the clicky balls inside it also had a wooden dowel visibly poking through the side on each block.  Not sanded smooth or anything.I'm disappointed as I've always loved HABA toys, and even after my husband spent a LONG time on the phone with their customer service, the best they said they &#34;could do&#34; was to offer us a discount of 20% if we bought any other products from them!",2
Alphabet Soup 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set by Cocalo,"Good for boy or girl, we also bought it before we knew the sex. In the end we had a boy, he loves the animal and now know jiraffe, zebra, elefant and so on...very pretty and educational, good quality too",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System Complete,"These are really classy baby latches. I'd go with these unless you really don't like the magnetic-style latch. If you want a regular push-it-down style latch, look at the Kidco with the springs. Otherwise, just get these and live happily ever after. These also work where standard latches don't, for example where a counter overhangs so that it is hard to get your finger in there.",5
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),"These did not qualify under my Amazon Prime membership, but they were so inexpensive including the shipping that they were well worth the wait to ship from China to the USA.  They actually did not even take that long to receive.  They were packaged safely and work like a dream.  I bought two sets to give to my friends.  After a long day I sit watching TV massaging my head.  Love, love, love this massager.",5
12 Volt Vehicle Car Lighter Adaptor for Medela Pump in style Breast Pump Freestyle and Lactina Pumps Replacement Auto Adapter for Medela # 67153,Bought this to work with my &#34;12V USB & FM 20W+20W Mini Car Power Amplifier With Remote Controller&#34; and it does the trick!,5
"KF Baby Table Edge Guard with 4 Corner Guards, Black, with kilofly Refrigerator Magnet","I bought this to wrap around the glass edges of my TV stand, and so far it has held up to the abuse by my one year old. She constantly pulls at it and attempts to bite it (before I can get to her), and the guard has stayed in place. This uses true 3M tape, so I'm not sure what others are complaining about. If you clean the area you intend to use this on well, it works better than any other tape.",5
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,"He absolutely loves this playmat.  He can spend 20 minutes there easily at one time!  He smiles, talks to the star and blinking lights and kicks the side bars like crazy to make the music play.  A great toy!",5
Special Edition Diaper Dude Boba 3G Carrier : Black with white Pinstripes,The carrier is awesome!  It works for both my husband and myself.  Easy to adjust sizing to fit both of us.  Son &#34;rode&#34; in it during a trip at Disneyland.  Worked wonderfully!  The buckles are heavy duty and the material is nice and durable.  Totally worth the money.,5
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty",tall for my Honda Odyssey and Corolla. good build and a decent car seat out there.,3
CoCaLo Daniella Crib Bedding Set 8 Piece,"I was attracted to this set for several reasons. The first thing that attracted me was its elegance and romantic feel. I am not a fan of all of the cutesy and frilly stuff available for baby girls. The price for an 8 piece set is almost too good to be true and I didn't have to pay for a bumper I would never use, to boot!Now that the set is in and the nursery is set up, I am even more pleased with the crib bedding. It is even prettier in person!",5
P'Kolino Full Size Puzzle Stacker,This is a twist on the traditional stacking toys with couple of added levels of complexity. If the plain wooden pieces are not interlocked with the colored piece according to size then all the pieces will not fit into the stacking rod. My daughter got this toy when she was 21 months old and is slowly figuring out all the levels of play. I think it will be a really good educational toy for a couple of years.,4
Black Diaper Bag,"I have tried MANY diaper bags over the course of my son's first year.  He is almost 14 months now and this diaper bag is absolutely perfect for him.  However, imagining having this bag during his first few months would be difficult.  In the beginning I carried A LOT!  Now his daily needs have downgraded to just a few items and this bag has worked best.  The bag is perfect for my toddlers needs and I also have room for my keys, wallet, lipstick, etc.  The cell phone carrier on the strap is a super great idea because I usually don't have time to dig for it in the bag while on the run.  It's a comfortable bag to wear for me, although it does get a little heavy when I've worn it for long periods of time.  My husband loves it also and he doesn't find the weight to be bothersome, even when I've jam packed it with all of our needs.  I bought this bag anticipating it will be well used on our upcoming trip to Disney World.  I believe I have made a wise purchase!",4
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Dee Dee the Dragon","My daughter decided on a nursery with a dragon theme!  Items have been hard to come by.  This dragon is very cute, seems to have a lot of stimulating details for the baby and I know she will love it!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"This is a great toy!  Our son will be 4 months old in a few days and we introduced it to him last week.  He has been a VERY active baby since birth -- kicking, wiggling, looking around, ready to move.  While he isn't a big fan of tummy time, he loves to be held in a sitting or standing position.  So once we were confident that he was strong enough to hold his head up to play, we got the jumperoo.  And, of course, he LOVES it!  His favorite toys are the lion and the sun.  He figured out right away what he needed to do to make the lights/music play (we keep it on short play so he's forced to interact more).  He isn't tall enough to touch the ground on the lowest setting, but we put a pillow under there so he can kick off the ground.  He bounces, plays with the toys and turns the seat.  Awesome addition to our growing collection of baby toys!  Wish it wasn't so big and could be stored easily, but that's my only complaint (and I don't see a way they could remedy).",5
Fisher-Price Little Superstar Step N' Play Piano,My son is now 1 year old & has already outgrown the center part in which he sat. I agree the quality of side toys is not the best both side hanging rattles broke in less than a month of use. but the music is soft & melodious doesnt hurt ears & my son enjoys just walking upto it & making the music now if not standing inside. (he manages to crawl out when we try to put him in). All in all happy inspite of minor flaws.,4
Lollacup Infant / Toddler Straw Sippy Cup + Straw Replacement Pack (Green),"Saw it on shark tank. Fell in love with it, ordered it, and my daughter loves it. Wifey say it leaks......they all leak.",5
"Boppy Noggin Nest Head Support, Brown Wheels","When I opened the box it was dusty from inside, i washed it and colors started to mix.This is not a head supporter for babies to sleep on, it's designed to support babies in a car's seat.",3
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","We received this as a shower gift in October. Our son was born in December and we began using the swing immediately, it cradled him well, and the sounds and swinging soothed him (he was 6.5 pounds, 21 inches when we brought him home). It became our favorite place for him to nap, he was comfy and fell immediately asleep and I was able to keep an eye on him as I went about chores around the house. A week before he turned 6 months, the motor just stopped working (he's now about 26 inches and 19 lbs, he is a very solid baby!). I chatted online with a representative and was informed that they did not have a replacement motor for the swing and that I could send it back, having to pay for shipping, to get a replacement swing. My son is getting to a point where he is not going to be able to use the swing for much longer, and I have to be without a swing for the time it takes for me to mail them the upper legs and them to turn around and send me a replacement. I can understand that they do not want to send swings out to people every time someone says something is wrong as it would be an easy way for someone to get a free swing, but it is a real inconvenience to the consumer to be without a swing in the interim. On top of that, the replacement would not be the same model, but the Snugamonkey version. My son adores the ears on this swing, they still sell the Snugabunny, so why the change? And, I feel irritated that I have to figure out how to box this up, go to the post office with an infant(my husband works full time and we are both full time students so I have to fit this into my already busy schedule) and pay money out of my pocket to ship because their motor is inadequate. I could understand there being issues if I was using this for a second child or if it was longer than six months even. As other reviewers have stated, that for the money paid for the product, the consumer should be able to use the product for longer. We have found a fix online for using an automatic air freshener motor to fix the issue, so we are going to give that a try first.",3
"Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey","I got this for my son who is just starting potty training at 2 years old. He is so determind to be a &#34;big boy&#34; he is doing much better with this than a kids potty chair, which works awesome for me (no clean up!). I love that seat has suction cups on the bottom to prevent the seat from slidding around on him. As the mom of a boy, I can also tell you the built in &#34;splash guard&#34; has saved me, and my floor, multiple times! I also like the fact that it is really soft, that way he can sit there for a while without his poor bottom getting red and sore (as he's just starting, sometimes it takes him a while!). I plan on getting another one for the grandparents house as well!",5
"BabySmart Cooshee Booster Seat Hybak with Travel Bag, Onyx","I'm very pleased with this product.  No hassle booster chair and easy to transport (fits in my larger stroller basket).  Also, very easy to clean.  I love the trendy colors and style--way better than those clunky hard plastic--straps everywhere boosters.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"""DISCLAIMER: I feel the need to add this  disclaimer to my negative feedbacks, it seems like when a product reviewer rates a products at Amazon with negative feedback, many other users who happen to like the item gets upset and vote on that negative reviews as being not helpful..If you really think you disagree with the review, let it go, do not vote down reviews just because you like the item. Rate reviews based on its merit, not yours""REVIEW:Pros:-Very easy to put togetherCons:-Very cheaply made, I would value it no more than $25-Requires C batteries, who uses C batteries nowadays !-The melodies does not last more than a minute, and it has 4 songs on it.I would expect something of a more quality built item from Fisher-Price, I can imagine this thing being sold in China Town for $10 in Flushing NY.However, if this ever goes to sale for $24.95, it is a good option as a cheap Gym for the baby.",3
"Kolcraft Easy Reach Rocking Bassinet with Light Vibes Mobile, Savannah Swirl Sage","We got this for our 3rd and it's perfect for both boy and girl.  There are a few bows on it that make it a tad more fem, but not bad.  It is cozy and the mobile is great!  We did not have this for our other kiddos.  It vibrates, moves bears in circles, sings, nature noises, music (no voice) and even has lights when you get baby in the middle of the night.  You don't have to turn on a lamp or overhead light and wake your spouse.  Also is very easy to move from room to room.  You can even take off the top bassinet part to use if you want to just lay on the floor (I did this when we had company and wanted to move baby's bed to a quieter area).  Great product!",5
"Britax Boulevard 65 TSIP Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I thought with as much as this seat cost it would be great but I think it is anything but great. The buckle at the bottom is so short it makes it very hard to fasten.It also has a big cushion around it making it hard to get the baby in the seat right. The seat looks comfy but it is very hot due to all the lining and surrounding side areas. The straps have too much on them making it also hard to fasten and its either too tight or too loose. It is not easy to adjust either. I have to take my baby out of the seat to tighten the straps. It may be safer but this seat is a pure pain, esp as much as it cost. Do not buy this style.",2
UPPAbaby G-Series Rain Shield,"A good product, but some instructions would have been nice.  It's not obvious which end is up when you take it out of the box.",4
Fisher-Price Sounds 'N Lights Monitor With Dual Receivers,We have used this monitor for almost two years without a single problem.  I keep it turned down low as it will buzz if you turn it up too high.  It hasn't failed us yet.,5
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,I bought this to replace the one I have -  my buttons were completely worn out... In fact I ordered two - as to have a spare ..  It does work.... but IT DOES NOT work with batteries... YOU MUST plug it in at all times... Very disappointing for what I needed it for!!  Will not really say I recommend this to anyone!,3
"Miracle Blanket Sleeper Wearable Blanket, Gray, Medium",Love this blanket!  I tried another but this one was much better quality.  It fits perfect and is also very soft.  My little girl loves to sleep in it!  I recommend getting two so when one is dirty you aren't having to go without.,5
"Sugarbooger Diaper Bag Organizer Pouches, Cotton",they make my diaper bag look so much better and i know where everything is..before I would have to dig in my bag but now that I have these i just grab the bag get what i need and I'm done.. I loveeee things bags,5
Baby's My First Photo Album of Family &amp; Friends,"I was looking for a baby album that would hold lots of photos and this one does. (I can't remember how many, maybe about 10.) I love the reflective mirror on the back page for baby to see herself.",5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"Knowing that I can hear my baby upstairs should she need me. It is veryclear and the """"Voice Activated"""" setting has no annoying hiss while the weeone is quiet. Good product - has been working fine for months now and was a good price (bought a used one).",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Miracle, Black/Silver, Cotton Mix","I have no comfort issues and it is quite easy to strap baby in and take her out. I imagine that pretty much any carrier would eventually be rather hot in the warmer season so I have no complaints there. The only thing I'd prefer is if it had some kind of pocket because it does become an issue of where to place ones phone, keys etc..which has made me consider also getting an ergobaby.  Otherwise it's a great stylish product.",4
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,I specifically bought this matress cover because our Babee Tenda matress is longer than the standard matress and all the reviews said it was too large for a standard crib matress.  It fits our babee tenda matress perfectly!  We LOVE IT!!,5
"Gerber 10 Count Prefold Gauze Cloth Diapers, White",I couldn't believe how hard it was to find cloth diapers.  Should have known that Amazon would have them!  Loved the thinkness of them and used them for burp cloths after I added ribbon and monograms!  Love 'em!,5
"Evenflo Triumph 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Santee","My son is almost 4 and has been in this seat since he was 4 months old (19lbs!). It is easily adjustable, sturdy, and safe. Being able to loosen and tighten the straps so easily to compensate for presence of coats, or a incredibly squirmy child, is really convenient. I am buying another Evenflo for baby # 2 (although I am getting the symphony so that kiddo can be in a 5-point harness until 65 lbs). That is my only genuine complaint, as I am replacing this seat with a booster for the 4 year old this summer that will allow him to stay in a harness until 65 lbs, rather than 50. The car seat does last long enough for this to potentially become an issue.",5
Fisher-Price Surround Lights &amp; Sounds Monitor with dual receivers,This is by far one of the worst purchase I've ever made. Don't waste your money! There's a random loud beeping all the time.,1
Once Upon a Potty POTTY GIFT BOX with mini-book -- GIRL,"My daughter loved this book and I loved that the first day we got it, she went pee.  She was only 20 months old.  It's been almost a year and she just stopped using it and started using the potty chair that is easier for me to dump.  This was easier for her to train in, but harder for me to clean.  It was a little gross that when I dumped it, it splattered. She has been potty trained all day and night for about a 4 months now.  SO it is GREAT for beginners.",4
"Baby Jogger Car Seat Adapter Single, Mounting Bracket","Easy to install. Works well with our chicco infant seat, baby sits pretty high up.  Folds down just fine but the bracket sticks out a bit, which makes it difficult but still possible to fit in the mini cooper trunk.",4
"Gerber 10 Count Flatfold Gauze Cloth Diapers, White",While we finally wore out our old ones was looking for a close match and these fill the bill while not as soft as our older ones.  I can see that they would fill the bill for babies as well.,4
KidCo Anti-Tip Furniture Straps,"I love this strap. It is easy to install and holds the furniture firmly against the wall. The directions say to always use two straps for each piece of furniture. For my little, light stuff I used one and couldn't tip it even when trying to pull it over. I used three on my tall, heavy bookshelf though just because it is a little top heavy and I didn't want to risk it falling. It is very sturdy now. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because of it being plastic and if the strap isn't pulled tight enough it could slip off of the one end of the bracket. If they are installed correctly this isn't a problem though.",4
Summer Infant Deluxe Comfort Booster- Tan,"This item is a good value and worthwhile for temporary use. The cloth on the back is a joke, it is just attached with two small bands and does not serve any purpose. We threw it away when we got it. The chair is nice for restaurants and visiting friends as it folds down and is fairly light. It folds up pretty well (the dark tan legs fold toward the middle and the dark tan arms fold toward the seat after the back of the chair is folded flat toward the seat). The problem is that once folded, it doesn't do a very good job of staying that way and easily comes apart.Summary: Good value and easy to use. Much better than the cloth that attaches to the table that we tried.",4
"Ju-Ju-Be Super Be Zippered Tote Diaper Bag with Pockets, Perfect Paisley",I love this Super Be!  I have several Ju Ju Be bags including a similar bag called the Mighty Be.  I love this one bc it has a zipper at the top and mesh pockets on the inside to stay organized.  You can't say that this bag isn't big enough bc there is tons of room.  Love the new color too!! Awesome job JJB!,5
Babys Journey Always Ready Changing Station,This is exactly what I needed for when our grandbaby comes to visit.  I love the stand with the compartments which hold everything you need for changing diapers.,5
"Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory","I am 9 weeks pregnant with twins and recieved this pillow about 2 weeks ago.  I am nearly 6 feet tall, so the pillow is a little short for where it should hit on the knees.  I also feel like it is lacking a bit in the cushioning especially for the back and I find I have a hard time keeping the pillow from falling of the edge of the bed as I move at night.  I have found that if I use a pillow along my back and another body pillow on the front and a pillow under my head it is very comfortable.  I also am not a huge fan of the pillow cover, it is a little rough and hard to get on.",2
"Munchkin Diaper Duty Organizer, Colors May Vary","Looks cute on changing dresser, but wish the cups were a bit bigger. Overall, it's a great organizer and recommend.",4
"DaVinci Parker 4 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Pure White",This Crib is very light wieght.  I was easy to assemble.  We love the bottom drawer for blanket strorage.  It is very pretty.  The only draw back it that in curves down in the front so when your baby learns to stand or pull themselves up you have to put the mattress even lower than you normally would because the middle section is a few inches shorter than the outer section.  It is alot easier for them to climb out in the center.  It would be better if it was straight instead of curved.  Other than that for the price it is nice.  If you are thinking this is a solid heavy wood crib its not.  Its something compareable to what you would get a kmart walmart or even target.,3
"Bloom Nano Urban High Chair, White Frame With Seat Pad Henna Brown","HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDLove everything about this chair. No idea why other rated it poorly since this chair is absolutely as described: looks fantastic, sturdy, cleans easily, and folds down to really thin (this is the most important part for us since we live in a small space).",5
"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant","We had the infant version of this last year and loved how easy it was to use.  I thought this was expensive for essentially a small sleeping bag.  But after a cold snap left us grouchy and chilly and staying inside wasn't an option, I bought this.  It's amazing.  Life changing.  He stays so warm inside, I don't have to worry if I take another lap around the block.  The only issue I had was how it affected the umbrella on my stroller.  Mine secures with velcro along the back of the seat.  This product slides down over the top of the seat, so my umbrella wouldn't attach.  I simply used four or five safety pins to hook the umbrella to the bundleme.  Worked great!Edit = I've received a lot of questions from people online this year asking if it works for specific strollers so I thought I'd edit to add that I have a Britax B-Ready that we used this on.  But we've also taken it on vacation with us and used it with a Chicco umbrella stroller and it worked fine.  I wouldn't use it full time with an umbrella stroller (I felt it was too bulky) but it worked.  I do leave it on all winter on the B-Ready.",5
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda Sportivo Stroller, Red","We have had this stroller for almost 2 years now, and it honestly has not been used too much. My daughter out grew it quickly not long after turning two she could reach the floor with her feet making it difficult to use. On some floor surfaces it is very difficult to maneuver. Our stroller also got a hole along the seem of the seat where the support bar is. I would not recommend this stroller or buy it again. The only pro is the storage basket is bigger than some similar strollers. The shade is also pretty useless.",2
4moms Cleanwater Infant Bath Tub with Digital Thermometer,"We have a large sink in our bathroom and this fit perfectly on top.  We had to buy a little hose (about a foot) to slide over the faucet and direct the water into the little container of the tub.  The set-up will take max 3 min, and we had our son at a normal height for his baths.  It was easy to manage the bath routine by one parent.We've tried other infant tubs but none fit over the sink.So, with a measuring tape, and some calculations this could be a GREAT tub!However he did grow out of it after a couple of months!",5
"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","My husband and I bought this for the top of our steps. We have always bought the extra tall gate. This gate, while well made, is way too high! It is partially my fault b/c I should have measured this before purchasing it.**Measure the height of where you want this to go before purchasing!**",2
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I LOVE this booster seat,which I use in place of a high chair because I have such a small house. It is portable, light, and easy to clean. It fits on any chair, and is tight and secure. I would definately recommend!",5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Pacific","I purchased the Moby Wrap as a Shower Gift for my son and his wife on the birth of their first child, a son, Finnegan. The Moby Wrap was on their gift list. Little Finn, arrived at 30 weeks, weighing in at 3# 3oz., and was released after 5 weeks in the NICU last weekend. The Moby Wrap was pressed into service immediately after discharge.On the day of discharge, my son shared a video (search YouTube) of Dr. Harvey Karp, a nationally renowned pediatrician and child development specialist, who serves as an Assistant Professor of Pediatrics at UCLA. Karp insists that babies are born with a calming reflex (much like the sucking, or rooting reflex) and it is the job of the parents to turn it on ...or suffer some anxious moments. Swaddling is one of those ways to turn it on, tight swaddling provides the continuous touching and support the fetus experienced while in Mom's womb.The Moby Wrap, while not technically swaddling, comes very close to it and provides comfort to both the newborn and the parents. I have had the chance to see Finnegan in his Moby Wrap with mom and dad, and will vouch that it makes a big difference. This is ""must have' for any newborn.",5

"Best Bottom Training Pants, Blueberry, Large",It worked for potty training but outer cover leaks easily. Still prevents a big mess on the floor but the covers turned out to be single use and therefore not that helpful unless I purchased more covers.,4
"Comotomo Natural Feel Set - Single Pack Green 5 oz Baby Bottle, PLUS Extra Pack Slow Flow Nipples","My Little One loves this bottle! It is a great bottle for transition from nursing to bottle feeding. My Little One had no issues with it. I would recommend them for nursing moms. They are also very easy to clean, there are not a lot of parts.",5
"Kidz Delight Magic Mirror Laptop, White/Blue","I gave this toy one star because it is creepy. It will tell your baby &#34;I love you&#34; and  &#34;you are my friend&#34;. Which is strange for any toy to do, but especially a laptop mirror.  An image matching the buttons that are pushed lights up in the mirror, and they flash very fast and bright. I am not sure if that is good for tiny developing brains. Every so often it will give the incorrect color or shape. If I had saved the box this I would have returned this item.",1
Dundee Burp Cloths/Diapers - White,"Bought these for my daughter to use with my Grandson and she says they work great. Highly recommend them to others,",5
Safety 1st Soothing Mist Ultrasonic Humidifier,Purchased this item because it was rated as the best in Consumer reports  Founed it to be very efficent  If you can t  stand the sound of water gurgling then it will be annnoying  Becuase I wear ear plugs because of noisy neigbors it is not a problem for me otherwise the noise would definitely keep me awake  So for me it works fine and I would recommed it highly,4
Gerber Graduates Insulated Sports Tumbler 3-Pack,"Maybe it's just my toddler boys but it seems once sippy cups with straws are introduced, that's the way they'd like to stay.  These cups are great, the little &#34;stopcock&#34; on the inside helps control the flow.  I've taken them off so fluid trickles out but my kids still don't want to drink from them.  So I'd recommend these cups for younger kids, like 12m.  They're very cute, we'll made.",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",These car seats are the best we have ever had!  Easy for our kids to get in and out of and they have a high safety rating we value above anything else!  Come in all different colors and convert as your kids grow.  Love the versatility.  Highly recommend.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"My 2 month old already loves this gym, and I am looking forward to when he can grasp the toys. He stays happy right now in it for about 10 mins on his own, longer if I play with him. He loves the music and stares at the lights. My only gripe is that it came with few toys, but that can be a good thing too because there are several places to attach your own and we filled it up! Great product. Also, it arrived on Christmas Eve, two days earlier than I expected. Excellent.",4
"Green Eats 8 Pack Feeding Spoons, Yellow","I know... made in USA, recycled material etc.. but these are not really usable esp for an infant.. (handle too small and was looking for something softer that he can bite) maybe once he grows up!",1
"Peg-Perego Pliko Mini Stroller, Aloe","Easy to fold and unfold. Stands nicely on its own. Nice and compact. LOVE the roomy seat, baby has room to grow, and she is soo comfortable in it too. Love the deep recline. LOVE the big canopy. Love the fabric and print. Pushes nicely. Very good quality.  I did buy this stroller to take in car and use at the malls and stores etc. I use an all terrains for long neighborhood walks and parks etc. I probably wouldn't use this one on rougher terrain.",5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"Very comfy.. You should buy when u r expecting ... i bought it for my wife..She was having a lot of trouble getting comfortable and sleeping through the night about 20 weeks into my pregnancy. She tried everything, proping a pillow between my knees, one under my side, etc...I was so uncomfortable. I finally decided to break down and spend the money on this pillow and I can't begin to tell you how much it has helped. She love the fact that it wraps around my back and come between my legs and also under my head all at the same time. Yes, the reviews about the pillow flattening out are true but I just fluff mine back up. There were also complaints about when you want to flip over on your other side, it's hard to adjust the pillow. She just flip her body over and don't move the pillow. It's just as comfortable. It does take up a lot of room in the bed but She can't stress that a good night sleep is so worth it for a pregnant lady. I think this is a must have during pregnancy. It also helps when you have back pain...",5
Sony 900 MHz BabyCall Nursery Monitor with Receivers,"We bought these monitors from Amazon when I was pregnant with our now 11 month old son and to this day have NO complaints or issues with the product. They have many different channels, which our old model did not (resulting in static and overheard conversations from our neighborhood!), are so sensitive we can hear him breathe, and have a nice battery saving feature which only turns on when it hears noise (even sighs in our baby's sleep!). We have receiver in our bedroom plugged into the outlet and have the other battery powered to move around our house and outside. The range indicator is an excellent feature and we have coverage everywhere we need it. I truely cannot find a thing about these monitors that we don't care for.As per any monitor, if you put a cell phone or cordless phone next to the monitor, you do get a little feedback but if you move it a foot away, the noise stops.",5
Carter's Child of Mine Baby's First Memory Book &quot;Thank Heaven for Little Girls&quot;,"I bought this for my son and 'daughter' for their first child (my first grandchild), and in comparing to the one I (still) have for my son from 20 years ago when quality was generally better for the price paid, this ranked nicely in equality.The pages are beautiful and everything is so nicely laid out! They already began entering in as much as they could (she was born on 12/12/2012 so we were a tad late in the purchasing of it).Currently I highly recommend this beautiful keepsake...and hopefully you won't see an update because it fell apart, but I will post an update if it does (but I pray that it won't, and it doesn't feel like it will).",5
Haba Ladybug Pacifier Chain,"I get a ton of compliments on this. I bought this one as a gift for someone else, but received a similar looking one (same maker) and it is perfect to attach to my daughters carrier/car seat. From 0-5 months, it provided me easy access to find the pacifier in a hurry, even while driving when I had to reach back and do it blindly. Now after 5 months, she picks it up herself and plays with it & looks at the colors. I can easily detach it from the carrier & re-attach it to her clothes when I take her out of the car. This way she has it with her if she wants it, and it's never falling on the floor. I love it!",5
"Kissaluvs Diaper Lotion Potion 4 oz, Spray",We cloth diaper and use cloth wipes. When necessary I just wet the wipes with water and spray this directly on my daughter's diaper area. Cleans well and makes everything smell fresh and clean.,5
"Taggies Max the Monster Character Blanket, Blue/Orange","We bought several so we'd always have a clean one. It's his favorite thing! He's never been into pacifiers, but his taggie makes him happy.",5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn","I really like the Halo sleepsacks because they keep blankets out of baby's crib.  They also work fairly well for swaddling my little one when he sleeps.  My only complaint with them is it is sometimes difficult to get a good swaddle with these, especially when baby is being non-cooperative.  It would help if there was a way to fasten both 'wings' instead of just the top one.  The Summer Swaddle-Mes have this and we find it much easier to defeat our Houdini baby in those than in the Halo swaddles.",4
"Graco Backless TurboBooster Seat, Galaxy","I read a lot of reviews, and checked safety ratings before purchasing this seat.  For the price you can't beat what you're getting!  This is simple to put in place (doesn't sit at an awkward angle), light-weight so your child can carry their seat to school for field trips if needed without hassle, and the fabric isn't itchy.  Having said that it will still snag like any other fabric and get little &#34;fray balls&#34; if you're kid is rough on it but it seems like pretty good quality.  I have one in every vehicle and my 7yr old son has no issues strapping himself in and making sure the belt is secure under the armrests. Would highly recommend over other boosters if backless is what you're looking for.",5
"Dr. Brown's Designed To Nourish My Dot Storage Labels, 72-Count, Colors May Vary",These labels are great!  I use them for labeling bottles for daycare.  they remove easily and leave no sticky residue behind. I love these labels!  they also fit glass jar baby food perfectly!,5
Medela TheraShells Breast Shells,"I bought these breast shells to help with sore nipples while breastfeeding my second child. I had high hopes for this product because I had previously used the larger-sized Medela shells with my first son years before (I thought I was buying the same thing). One problem with buying these online is that you can't see what size they are. They are very small, just big enough to fit over your nipples only, which makes these extremely awkward looking underneath clothing. It makes it look like you have giant, round nipples. Trust me, it's not a cute profile.Another problem is that they are only made for people with smallish nipples. I don't think I have particularly large nipples, but these cut right into the middle of mine, totally defeating the purpose of making them less sore.Finally, I only wore these two times, and both times they LEAKED MILK ALL OVER ME. The seal created by snapping the parts together isn't water tight, so the milk leaked right through both times even after I tried to secure them tightly. I was extremely disappointed in everything about these shells and wish I could get my money back.I highly recommend the Avent Isis Breast Shells intead. They're more comfortable and more effective than the similar sized Medela shells, and certainly better than these little ones!",1

Yookidoo Flow 'N Fill Spout Bath Toy (9m+),"My son loves this toy, he will play wih it for as long as we let him.

Jiniy CAR &amp; ROAD Kids Wall Decals Deco Mural Sticker(BSS58241),"The decals bring directions with numbers, which most of them don't.  This makes it very easy for me to put together.  I love it and it was the perfect buy for my toddler's playroom.",5
Reusable Adhesive Silicone Nipple Cover Breast Pads,"These are great for the price. I have used them over and over ( about a dozen times) and they still stay on. They are starting now to lose stickiness so I will most likely be buying another pair soon. I have tried many and this is UP there in quality, especially for the price.. I wear them alone but mostly under a nice fitting cami or sports bra",4
"Colgate Classica I Foam Crib Mattress, White","After extensive review, I decided to go with this firm mattress for our three-month old.  The mattress is extra firm, especially around the edges, which we like.  Great peace of mind knowing that our son will have the spine support needed as he grows and reduced chance of suffocating from the mattress.He slept easy on it from day one.I highly recommend this mattress to parents looking for quality and FIRM support for their infants.",5
"OXO Tot On-The-Go Drying Rack and Bottle Brush, Green","This works for travel, I like the brush and nipple cleaner. I wish there was a small hole for drainage, but otherwise it suits its purpose. Plus you don't have to put bottle parts on counters at work or hotel rooms is a major plus.",4
"BooginHead SippiGrip, Blue/Green/White","Fits any sippy with a dip in the middle or with loop handles well.  Seems like it may slip off of a sippy without handles or with straight sides.  Great for stroller, also used for traveling in the airport.  I put sippy in the cupholder on my son's bag and strapped it in for additional security.",5
"Safefit Snack Pod, Grey","I bought this to use on my daughter's carseat (Britax marathon.)  It was ok while it lasted.  My husband somehow broke the plastic arm that goes over the carseat right before we took off for a weekend road trip.  I was dissapointed.  It needs to be much more durable, it only lasted about a month.  Maybe if that part was reinforced with metal or something it would be more durable.",3
"The First Years Lanolin Free Nipple Butter, 2 Ounce","Used it for both kids who are 23 months and 7 months. My oldest breast fed up to 8 months, my youngest is still breastfeeding. It is oily soft light and absorbs quickly. Did not affect the feedings or give any problems whatsoever. If anything, my babies recognized the smell that they were excited to start a feeding even more, like the smell of something gourmet reeking from the oven, yummm.",5
Safety 1st UniLite Universal Car Seat Umbrella Stroller - Blackstone (car seat not included),"Pros- fits easily with my safety 1st car seat, smooth ride, light, fairly easy to collapse and reopen- great for small spaces and traveling. The little bar for sippy or snack cups is nice. Comes with a cup holder for adults. The sun hood has some tiny side pockets which is useful for storing a few small items. Decently priced if you look around.Cons- Recline maximum is about a 45 degree angle and seat could use a bit more cushion. I'm thinking about getting a  memory foam seat liner. I do like the cupholder when it manages to stay on, but the darn thing is always swiveling all over the place and eventually my drink falls out due to it turning upside down or the whole thing comes off. I also REEALLLLLY wish safety 1st made umbrella strollers with an adjustable leg rest so that my kiddo can sleep better while I'm shopping. The sun hood doesn't have a little peek a boo window so I can check on sleeping beauty. Also the basket is tiny. Like really tiny.",4
"CoCaLo Window Valance, Azania",I bought the bedding set that matches and needed to get a second valance to fit the window opening in the nursery. Love the quality and colors.,5
"Mumi&amp;Bubi Solids Starter Kit, 42 x 1oz Cubes In Two Compact Baby Food Freezer Storage Trays, Plus Free e-Recipes","I was hesitatant about spending this much on ice cube trays for baby food but these are totally worth it! The food comes out so easily especially if you let the trays sit out for a few minutes and run hot water over the back which isn't a big deal.  I first used them for spinach that I blended in my vitamix to use in smoothies before my baby was big enough for solids.  I've pureed bananas which came out the easiest, mangoes, and sweet potatoes so far. I needed to spread the sweet potatoes smoother on the tops and that would have made it easier to push on them to get them out. Next time I might try coconut oil wiped in the trays to help but they even came out just fine after letting them sit out a few minutes. I love that there are 2 trays and they hold big batches of food from my vitamix.  I just store them in freezer bags so I can make more food.",4
"Infantino Crib Companion Soother, Lullabuddy","I received this as a gift for my 15 month old over 2 months ago.  I'm not sure how this could be considered a soother when there are so many issues with it.CONS-The lights are WAY bright and blink to the beat of the music.  Unless you're using this in a brightly lit room, the blinking lights are jarring and way too rapid.  I feel like I'm going to have a seizure looking at this thing in the dark.  It gets my toddler's attention but by keeping him distracted, not lulling him to sleep.-You have to really push on the belly for it to go on so my toddler has a hard time getting it to turn on on his own.-The music is much too loud.  It does have a lower volume setting but I think it could be quieter.  The high volume setting is ridiculously loud.PROS-The music is really nice, playing familiar songs like ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" and ""Old MacDonald.""  My son likes listening to it and will dance to it.-It's got a cute design that my son like to look at.When we're having a rough night, I turn to this and it will help calm him down sometimes by distracting him.  The problem is that it doesn't really help him fall asleep because nothing is controllable on this thing.  If you could dim the lights more or make them stay lit, this would be so much more useful.  It's fun to play with when he's awake and wants to dance or hear me sing along to it but I don't think that's the toy's intention. I'm looking for something else to help with the nighttime sleeping.  You should too!",2
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","I purchased this as a replacement for the HomemedicsHoMedics myBaby Soundspa Lullaby Sound Machine and Projectorsound machine and projector.  I was replacing the Homedics one due to a broken projector.The munchkin one worked great for about 2 months, then the projector broke.

"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","swing gate opening  is very narrow, larger people won't be able to use this with out squeezing through.  also don't like walking over the metal support along the bottom, children trip when allowed to go through.  good thing is that you don't have to drill holes in walls to set it up as it can be pressure mounted or screwed into the wall.  I would never use it for a stairway as it is easy to trip over bottom!",4

"Stork Craft Tuscany 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, White",I rated it as a 5 because this crib is exactly what my daughter-in-law ordered.  Easy to put together.  Have it shipped exactly where you want it; it' doesn't fit in a sedan to transport to the baby shower yourself.,5
North States Supergate Expandable Swing Gate,I've used a lot of these gates for both children and pets.  My satisfaction is usually dominated by how easy they are to operate.  This is the worst one I've used.  I am physically strong but cannot compress the latch spring without using two hands.  The latch components are cheap and ill fitting.  I doubt many mothers could operate it with a baby in one arm.,2
"Cosco Umbria Stroller, Moonstone Dot","this has everything i like, storage, tray and cup holder. but the seating space is not very much. my 2yr old granddaughter is small for her size and it's a tight fit. The tray has no release and i couldn't get her out of this stroller without her shoes coming off. i finally popped off the tray but now it doesn't stay on very well. this really seems like a doll stroller. maybe for the first few months ok but after that i wouldn't recommend it.",3

(1) Prime Line Automatic Door Closer in WHITE,I followed the instructions.Did the install to a typical household door that goes to my garage.  This is a door that swings very easy on its hinges.Worked the first time.  On the second it was a little weaker.  By the fourth try it barely moved the door.Cheap manufacture.  My guess is that some will work and some will not.  If you are like me you do not have the time to waste.On top of that I now have four holes in the molding to my door plus another one in my door.I hate crappy products.,1
"Mommys Helper Safe-Er-Grip Drip Dry Portable Drying Rack, White","It adheres to the wall via a suction cup. It cannot hold anything with any weight to it, like a towel - it just falls off the wall. It would probably hold a light-weight item like a handkerchief.",3
"Leachco Easy Teether XL Side Crib Rail Cover, 2 Pack, Ivory",These teething guards are great!  I like that they're washable and easily removable.  I would much rather have my infant son mouthing/chewing these cotton ones instead of the other plastic ones that are on the market.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I used the have this dangling from her carseat, but it is a tad large, so I relocated it to her evenflow megasaucer.  She just stared at it on her carseat (she was younger then though, now she's 4 months old), but now have smaller toys for that. So have this attached to her evenflow megasaucer via the chain link toys for infants and this makes the toy easily reachable plus won't fall on the ground when she drops it..it just dangles over the side (so it stays clean).  She gets so angry when this thing falls too.  She loves chewing the ""feathers"".  She just goes to town and this toy gets drenched!!  Cute toy and the hook is awesome so you can attach it to anything really.  I have other toys that are easily reachable on the megasaucer as well, but it seems like this is her favorite..I think it is the crinkle sound that she is drawn to. This will keep her busy in her megasaucer for a while, so I can get stuff done; she's a needy baby too. Anyways..cool toy, lots of colors and textures and you can hook to anything.",5
"Genuine Inspired by Finn Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklaces (11.5&quot;-12.5&quot;, Raw Amber - Diversity)","We bought an amber necklace for our firstborn out of desperation when he was cutting 6 teeth in one month around 15 months old. It was miraculous how much relief it brought him! With our second baby, we wasted no time ordering an amber necklace. Both our kids have been early teethers (4 months old) & the necklace definitely brings relief to our newest addition.  He drools less & is much less irritable while wearing it.During overnight sleep, I usually wrap it twice around his ankle & put on footsie pjs or tuck them into his socks so I don't worry about strangulation.  I don't know what we would do without our teething necklaces!",5
"InGenuity Smart and Quiet Swing, Briarcliff","The swing is beautiful, quiet and made of quality material (except the yellow straps, they did feel a little cheap). The music is wonderful and relaxing. The only problem is that my son HATES it with a passion. As soon as he would be laid down in this swing he would start screaming at the top of his lungs. I think it might be because of the position he has in the seat - not seated down, not laid on his back but just in between. I had to sell it at a yard sale a couple weeks later because I had gotten rid of the box. So this swing was a waste of money for us but I can see it working wonderfully with other children.",3
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Since we have a high table in our home, normal high chairs could not work for our baby. After searching and reading reviews, we chose this booster seat to be the main eating area for our child. It looked durable, clean and has a name we trust. Our baby began eating in it at 4 months and is now 8 months. Recently we have found bruises on her back and looked for the cause. Our child is not in daycare and is in our care all day. We realized that when she gets excited, she bounces up and down in her seat. The back of this booster seat is hard and is the reason she has these bruises on her back. We now place a small pillow behind her to solve this problem. I would caution any parent from buying this seat or any others without a padding on the back. No parent wants to see thier child harmed, especially if they know they could prevent it.",3

Railroad Train Baby Boy Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"I bought this for my son, who is now 15 months old.  After Months of washing the quilt and sheet are still vibrant and in great shape.  The only thing that didnt hold up was the bumper.  My son ripped it apart from the strings that held it to his crib.  It is very cute though, I turned the part that said ""railroad"" into a window valence. It was too cute to get rid of.  When I bought it, it did not come with the diaper bag part, so I don't know how that is, it did come with odd things like the diaper holder and a little pillow...which I did not need or want and ended up throwing those out.  The price is fantastic for what you get, I highly recommend :)",5

"Ingenuity Cradle and Sway Swing, Bella Vista","Overall:  I would buy this swing again.  We bought it new and got our money's worth.  I would recommend this to a friend or consider buying it for them if it were on their registry.For context, I don't have a point of comparison - we have one baby, we had this one swing.  I was shopping for used swings, but I liked the reviews for this one and since our infant was already old enough to use it (and I had dishes that needed to be washed!) I bought it new here.Our baby prefers to be held, and this swing still satisfied him well.  The option to turn him to swing side-to-side or forward-and-back was not only useful to change his motion, but also to give him a more neutral view when using the swing to help rock him to sleep.  He's 10 months and 19 pounds, and we could keep using the swing based on height/weight, but he prefers to roll to his stomach/side when he's sleeping and to be moving around when awake, so it fits him but doesn't suit him anymore.PROS:-Amazing battery life.  We used it regularly for almost nine months and I did not have to change the battery once.  Easy to change if you have to.-Very easy to assemble.  I put it together during one of our little's cat naps.-Music and white noise are both fine.  Let's face it, you listen to a LOT of crappy music when you have kids, it's nice when someone makes something child-oriented that is still respectful of a parent's ear.-Seems very sturdy.  The structure of the swing did not rock or sway at all when he was in motion.-Easy in/easy out.  The open design and adjustable mobile makes it very easy to get baby in and out.  Also, high enough off the ground that it's not a strain.-Very smooth motion, no clicking or ticking that I've seen with other people's swings.CONS:-Huge footprint.  If you are tight on space, this will feel big.  (I suppose the footprint is also a pro because the swing feels very sturdy.)-Taking it apart for storage, it gave me some trouble.  It's pretty easy to disassemble overall, but there is one metal piece with an inexplicable groove, and in order to remove the clip I had to use a needle nose pliers, and then ended up jamming it down in the hollow stand.  This is probably user-error, but it does mean I need to buy a new clip if I am going to pass the swing along to anyone else.-You turn the swing on, then push it to get it going.  Sometimes I had to turn the swing off and on several times to get it to stay in motion after I pushed it.  Again, could be a user-error problem, but I did find this perplexing.",4
"Evenflo Jump &amp; Go Baby Exerciser, Red Racer",I got this jumper second hand and love it.  is is cute and has lights and two little toys attached that slide.

"Toy Hammock - Deluxe Jumbo Toy Hammock Storage Organizer - If Your Looking To Eliminate Clutter, Like Stuffed Toy Animals or Soft Toys Then This Extra Large Toy Hammock Net Is The Perfect Solution - Designed In White So It Blends Perfectly In To Any Nursery, Boys or Girls Bedroom. Very Easy To Install And Expands To 6 feet/1.83 meters (72 x 48 x 48 inches) - Comes With A Lifetime Guarantee From A Company You Can Trust.","TheToy Hammock by Freddie and Sebbiemakes for easy and quick storage of stuffed animals when it comes time for sleep.  The hammock is attached to the wall in three places and install was really simple  The kit includes 3 hand screw hooks for attaching to the wall; I would recommend for best application, try to put them into studs if you can.  If you don't have a stud finder, the included plastic wall ankers should give you pretty good stability, especially considering this net is designed for lightweight objects.I installed this hammock net in my nieces room.  This is great for bedtime when all the stuffed animals just won't fit on the bed too.  The great part is this keeps the clutter up and out of the way.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]",5
WallStickerUSA Medium &quot;TRIUMPH is just a little TRY plus a little UMPH&quot; Quote Saying Wall Sticker Decal Transfer Film 17x25,"Awesome decal for my gym!  My clients absolutely love it.  It wasn't too difficult to mount, though it did not come with instructions.  Word of advice: it's a much easier task with two people.  The decal has adhesive on both sides of the lettering and is mounted on waxed paper.  The top is protected by a sheet of plastic.  You have to roll the paper backing off and carefully align the decal on the wall (a grid is provided).  MAKE SURE TO LEAVE THE PROTECTIVE PLASTIC OVER THE DECAL WHILE AFFIXING IT TO THE WALL!  Gently rub the decal to press in place and then SLOWLY and very CAREFULLY remove the plastic covering.  I've had it up on a Sheetrock painted wall for for six months now with no peeling.",5
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I bought this manual pump after talking to my sister who swore by it.  I had been using a rented electric pump from the hospital and was shocked to hear how she loved the manual one!  I decided to give it a try and was surprised that I enjoyed it.  The manual pump took a little time to assemble (nothing major as most of the parts came already put together)and once I started pumping- it was very smooth.  I found it worked well in conjunction with the electrical pump (when I was pumping every 4 hours I would use it every other pumping)I was pleased I was able to get as much out of each breast as when I used the electric pump- and I liked that it was quiet and I could do it in my living room while I was watching tv (rather than in the bedroom where the electric one was set up)I was not able to use it exclusively tho as when I tried to do so, I would not be able to pump as much out as I had done regularly.  I loved that you could pump directly into the bottle and then put the lids on (instead of having to pump it out and then pour into a bag). The downside was you could only do one breast at a time so it did take a little longer than the electric one. Overall I was very pleased with the purchase and am glad I had it as an alternative.",4
Tommee Tippee Sippy Cup 11oz - 9m (Pink/Purple),"While, at first I thought the cup was great, it really did not leak at all- my daughter who is only 17 months has figured out how to throw it, or even drop it, and dislodges the stopper. Then is spills all over the place. So as long as you don't have a kid who is going to drop or throw the cup, It isn't the best.",3

"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","My daughter is in kindergarten and has this lunchbox along with the owl backpack.  We love it!  It is the perfect size for her snack, and it is so, so, SO cute!  It'll never get mixed up with anyone else's!  It is not a huge bag, so probably not a great option for older kids who are bringing more food.  It's easy to clean out, and my daughter has no trouble opening/closing it, or getting her items out.  It seems to be very durable.UPDATE:This lunchbox is now in it's second year of use and we still adore it.  My youngest daughter (in preschool) has adopted it for her snacks at school.  I put it in the washing machine often (I air dry it) and it still looks almost brand new.  And gets compliments all the time!Update aug 2013:Still going strong!  This is now to small for us to use for school but its great for bringing snacks and drinks when we are running errands.  Has been washed a zillion times and still looks pretty good.  :)",5
"UPPAbaby 2013 G-lite Stroller, Denny Red","So...I had written a review a few months ago complaining that the stroller was amazing while it lasted but that it gave out after a few months.  I finally got around to calling Uppababy and I could not be more impressed or amazed at their customer service.  For one thing, somebody picked up IMMEDIATELY (how great to talk to a human and not have to go through a maze of ""Press 1 for blah, Press 4 for blah"") and the lady, Julie, was incredibly helpful.  It turns out mine had been from a small batch of strollers that had a defective latch and that, since I had been stupid and forgotten to register it, they  weren't able to inform me of it.  They are sending me a brand new stroller (without a defective latch this time!), and I couldn't be more delighted because when I had it and it worked it was the lightest, easiest, most maneuverable stroller I have ever owned, and I was crushed when it broke.So bottom line, don't even think about trying to save a few bucks.  Not only is this the best stroller I've ever used but the customer service is unbeatable.  Worth every penny.",5
"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black","We bought this before our first since we had leather seats in the car at the time. We wanted to protect the leather from getting permanant dent marks from the car seats.  This thing catches everything!!! We even had a few barfing accidents when he was almost a year old when the car seat didnt catch the mess, the seat protector did which in turn saved us from cleaning formula and gung from in between the back seats!  This is also great for those runaway cracker crumbs and cheerios!  We now have a different car without leather seats but we still using it to keep the seats a little neater from spills!  Great product!By the way, when we sold the car with the leather interior, you never would have known there was a baby car seat back there!",5

It was a gift for a grandson and grandma did well with this one. I highly recommend this product.",5
Aquaus Toilet Bidet Handle / Diaper Sprayer with ** BONUS ** Rockin' Green Laundry Detergent and Tooth Tissue sample,"I bought this to spray down dirty diapers. Dunking is possible and a good choice if you don't have the money to buy these, but we are very happy to make the change to a diaper sprayer. I'm pregnant and nauseous, and was still dunking diapers for the beginning of this pregnancy... Being able to spray down the diapers decreases the amount of time I have to deal with poo and I've noticed having fewer issues. This diaper sprayer was fine on installation and has not leaked at all. We just turn on the water flow, spray the diaper, turn off the water flow, quickly squeeze the trigger to get the rest of the water out of the sprayer, and hang it up. We haven't had issues with water being left in the sprayer and creating a pool on the floor like other people have mentioned about diaper sprayers. Overall, awesome purchase and so glad we got this! If you need to use it on yourself, it is a little cold since it just uses the tap water temp, but it would do the job.",5
Mommy's Helper Kid Keeper,While my son found it amusing... and actually was having fun with it...

Fisher-Price Rainforest Baby View Auto Mirror,"I absolutely love this monkey mirror. My husband has an Eddie Bauer child safety mirror in his truck and it works very well, but only shows the baby's face. This Rainforest mirror shows me my baby's entire car seat so I know what she's doing with her hands as well.The only thing I would change is the method of stabilizing it. It tethers great to the built-in hook behind my back seat, but the stabilizing strap doesn't attach to the actual seat. If I take a turn faster than 8-10mph, the whole thing tips over. It's not a safety problem, since the mirror is round and I can still see my baby, but it's off-center at this point, so I have to adjust my rear-view mirror...and the monkey is then upside down.Otherwise... great product!!",4
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,"My daughter has been in this seat since she was 8 mo. old, she will be 2 in 17 days - This seat is awesome!

While he is not quite ready to self feed (he just likes to mash the food with his hands) I took the rubber off and hold onto the plate and feed him. I love the divided sections, keeps the apple sauce from running into the rest of the food :) and the plate size itself is fairly big (a lot bigger than I expected) so it's something he can use for a long time.The robot pattern is really cute and I know this will be a plate he will use and love for years to come.",5

"Prince Lionheart Faucet Extender, Gumball Green","We bought this for our kitchen sink so our toddler could wash her hands, and it works great!  Over time, it does tend to work its way up the faucet (towards the back of the sink) for some reason, which shortens its &#34;extension&#34;, but it's very easy to pull it back into position.  We take it off pretty often to facilitate doing the dishes, and it's easy to take on/off.  Note that the water will have some momentum as it flows through this (especially if coming from a higher flow kitchen faucet), so the water sort of shoots off the end and actually gets extended past the edge of the plastic extender.  This is great because otherwise, the water would still be too far away for our daughter to reach.  However, if you have a very small sink, it might be a problem.",5
Graco Ultra Clear  49MHZ Baby Monitor,"These monitors are very clear, and can be turned up VERY loud. They wake up my boyfriend on low during his shift with baby, and almost nothing wakes him up. My son often spits up long after feedings when we put him down, and sometimes he chokes on it in bed... this monitor picks up the gurglings so we can go in and make sure he's okay. We like that it has a visual guage for how loud he is getting. There is some static, and some sort of high pitched tone sometimes, but we live in apartments and I'm sure there is interference from upstairs. Our phones chagers cannot be plugged in on the same socket. For the price, these are worth the money :)",4

"Dr. Brown's 3 Pack BPA Free Polypropylene Bottle, 8 oz","These bottles leak badly no matter what I do!! They started leaking about 6 weeks after I bought them. They leak from the rim. I searched the net for a solution to this problem, tried experimenting with the bottles etc but nothing works. Do not buy these bottles if you hate leaky bottles like I do. I have a hard time producing breast milk and pumping it and it is very hard to see it leak out the side of the bottle. Bottom line don't buy them unless the compANY FIXES THE PROBLEM AS I HAVE REALIZED THAT I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH THIS PROBLEM. ON THEIR WEBSITE THEY TELL YOU 3 REASONS WHY THE BOTTLE MAY LEAK BUT THE LEAKAGE FROM MY BOTTLES IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH ANY OF THESE THINGS. THEY NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THEIR BOTTLES!!!",1
"The First Years 4 Pack Ziploc Sippy Cup, 10 Ounce","I bought these at Wal-Mart thinking the Ziplock brand would last me longer than the cheaper brand I usually buy. They leaked... really bad. So I thought I was doing it wrong. I tried many different ways of closing them and nothing worked. Nothing makes you madder than paying good money for a product and then upon getting it home realizing that's it defective. :( Seeing all the negative reviews made me realize I shouldn't have bought them, but still there are the other reviews; the few five-star reviews that loved the product saying ""learn how to put the lid on"" and ""these are great cups"". So... I tried again to make them work, and there was no getting around it. They leak. If there's a way to make them work, I couldn't figure it out. Here are some alternatives that I've tried and liked.I use the Munchkin Click Lock with my 10 mo. old and my 2 yr. old. I like the soft spout and the click lock lid. This is the best spill-proof sippy cup that I have tried.For older kids who haven't quite mastered drinking out of a regular cup, I use the First Years Take and Toss for my three yr old. They are inexpensive and spill-proof, but the tops can pop off if your child prys it off.Other mentionable sippy cups include Munchkin Mighty Grip Toddler Sports Bottle, Nuby No Spill Sports Sipper, and the Nuby No-Spill Insulated Cool Sipper.",1

The harness is very thin, it will twist a lot.",5

Sony 900 MHz BabyCall Nursery Monitor with Receivers,"The Sony BabyCall monitor is a solid performer.  We have used one for almost 3 years with our first child and the battery still continues to hold a charge.  We have a 2 story home with the children's rooms upstairs.  There is occasional interference, but it is easily remedied by moving the monitor slightly.  With the 27 channels to choose from, there will be one that will work well in the home.  The advantages of the rechargeable battery and good performance led us to purchase yet another monitor for our second child.  The two receivers are nice to have, as we can leave one upstairs and the other downstairs for the newborn.  I would recommend anyone to buy.",4

Cariboo Classic Bassinet in Mahogany,"I don't have room in my bedroom for a crib and looked at all the bassinets I could find and they seemed like junk  that actually would fall apart. This crib has a natural wool pad which fits the bassinet perfectly and the wood is beautiful and so far has not scratched at all. Because I had done the research and went to magic beans store to see the bassinet first, I knew what it would look like and that it was the bassinet for my family.  I am not sure about it sliding across the floor as I also have hardwood floors and it has not moved unless pushed with a good bit of weight. In addition it is the most stable bassinet that I seen, it does not shake or wobble. The sheet can not be washed but I think it is because it is not preshrunk which is slightly disappointing but I really wanted a natural organic experience for the first few months of my babies life. In addition you get the 100% cotton sheet which is super soft.  I would recommend that you go to a store to see if you like before you purchase this item as this item is a bit pricey for a bassinet. In addition having done the research beforehand I knew that you had to buy specialized sheets but that seems to be standard for bassinets.",5
Munchie Mug - Top Rated Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Ages 1 to 4 years. Made in AMERICA. - BPA and phthalate free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top,"My daughter is 11 months old and I bought this cup out of desperation.  She is always tossing and dumping her cheerios all over the house.... I hate stepping on cheerios everywhere I go and sick of cleaning them up.  It took her about an hour to get the hang of the cup and it is amazing.  It doesn't spill, you can throw it, shake it, drop it or whatever you want and it won't spill.  The only downside is that my daughter will grab one side of the fabric cover and then shake the cup and that causes cheerios to come out, but not nearly as much as if she dumped a tupperware.  The babies can also take out a handful of cheerios and toss them.  For the price this product is worth every penny and I am going to tell every mother I know about it!! I love it and so does my daughter!! (it can come in handy as a toy too)",5

Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,"Before getting pregnant and round I was a stomach sleeper. I'm short- 5'1"", and before getting the bump was pear shaped- large hips and a small chest. I've had it since I was about 18 weeks and am now at about 27 weeks.Pros:-When sleeping on your side it supports both your front and your back, taking some pressure off of your hips. (It's hard to describe and you can only really see what I mean when you try it.)-Before I got it I was sleeping with three pillows- one under my head, one in between my legs and and one hugged up to my chest. That made it really hard to roll over, taking all of the sheets with me and requiring a lot of effort. Now, I just have to roll over and there's pillow on the other side of me, too.-It allows me to sleep sort of on my back/sort of on my side. I can keep my hips and knees wrapped around one side of the pillow, but I can lean my chest back so that it isn't crushed. (It's hard to explain, but hopefully it makes sense to some of you)-If you have to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night (hahaha, ""if"") you just fold up one of the ""legs"" and go. When you get back you just fold it back down and go back to sleep-no wrestling multiple pillows back into place.Cons:-It can be a little warm, but nothing a couple of degrees on the a/c thermostat cannot fix-I can see it getting a little ""flatter"" over time, but I think fluffing it and flipping it regularly (since I try to sleep more on my left than my right) should help with that-It's big! We have a queen-sized bed and it definitely takes up my half of the bed and perhaps a bit more-Some might consider the cover to be a bit ""scratchy,"" though I thought it was fine. I bought two nicer pillow cases and sewed them together and covered the part where my face goes, but this was mostly for ease of washing.Overall, it's not perfect. I still have times when my hips hurt or my arm falls asleep, but I feel like it's better than it was before I got it. Actually, we went to visit family about two weeks ago and I didn't bring the pillow because it's so large. I didn't sleep a wink all weekend because my back and hips ached without it. So, don't anticipate that this will be a 100% fix, but I definitely wouldn't want to be without it!",4
"Little Luxe Infant Car Seat Handle Arm Cushion, Black",The padding was nice on the arm handle cushion and great price.  I think next time around I would purchase the more expensive brand arm cushion though.,3
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump,"I have been exclusively pumping since my daughter was born. I was initially given my sister's old unit that was seven years old and that she used for two years. I bought new parts and was all ready to use it, but sadly the unit died almost immediately. So I ordered a new one just like it in the newer model.  It is a great little machine.Pros:Closed system is great.It's small and easy to travel with.Cons:It's a little noisy. I always have to turn the TV volume up when I'm pumping.For the price this little unit is really great.",5
"Evenflo 6 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","LOVE LOVE LOVE these bottles!!!I know they are ""old school"" but these are the bottles for me!I feel better having glass...I'm weird like that. These fit in the diaper bag so much better than the fat new bottles and I've never had one leak. My son has never had an issue with them (even while breastfeeding too). We've been using these and the 8 ounce Evenflo Classic Glass for 6 months now and I plan to with any future children. No leak issues, no gas issues.We got a few Similac bottles and a Tommee Tippee. I prefer these over them.",5
Baby Trend Activity Walker,"The picture makes you think the rear wheels rotate like the front ones do, but they don't. This was the reason I purchased it. Walmart sells this exact one for $30.00. Which would have been &15.00 cheaper and I knew those wheels didn't rotate.",3
"OXO Tot Flip-Top Snack Cup, Green, 5 Ounce","I got this for my 3 year old and it fits perfectly in his car seat cup holder. A bit too perfect, in fact, it's gotten stuck before. The flip lid doesn't feel secure enough to me. I feel like it could easily get knocked open inside his backpack and spill the contents everywhere. Otherwise, I like the design of it. My 3 year old can't open it by himself (yet) so that's a plus.",2
"Neat Solutions Baby Einstein Biodegradable Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemat , 30-Count","These are nice to have when we go out with our son to restaurants and we need to feed him.  You do not have to worry about the cleanliness of the table or how dirty things will get.  My son is only 11 months, so he is more fascinated with the noise the plastic makes than the decorations.",5
NoJo Alexis Garden Wall Decals,I wound up framing these for my baby girl's bedroom to match her bedding set.  I stuck them to photo paper in different configurations and have them in 5 frames.  I still have some decals left over too. A good buy - especially if you have the frames already.,5
Fisher-Price Kick and Feel Musical Farm Friends,My friend recommended this toy saying that it's her son's favorite so I started searching for it. BRU/TRU used to have it online but not any more. I called my local TRU and was told it would be in stock soon. TRU sells it for $[...] or something. I'm surprised to see it's sold so expensive here. Is it different from the model sold at TRU?,5
BRICA Baby In-Sight Magical Firefly Auto Mirror for in Car Safety,One of my twin grandsons does not like to ride in the car very much. His brother immediately falls asleep and Aiden just cried. Bought this for him and it works perfectly. He needs lots of visual and auditory stimulation at times (comes from spending his first 3 months in the NICU and PICU) and this works perfectly. He can watch himself in the mirror and loves the music and fireflies.  What a great buy!,5
"Maclaren Quest Sport Stroller, Black/Champagne",We spent a lot of time reviewing this product and researching information prior to our purchase.The product is indeed great! The best stroller and (or) umbrella stroller we've ever had for our kid.,5
The First Years Breastflow Starter Kit,It works as per the claims. But it is leaky. Very frustrating when you are feeding a crying baby.,3
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"We didn't buy this for my daughter until she was about 11 months old and we were about to move cross-country so we needed some good car toys. She's now 13 months old and still loves this thing!! She pushes the button herself to play the music and lights and sometimes will keep it going for 20 mins straight (that's huge for a toddler!!). The music itself is nice, my husband describes it as the most calming toy she has. The lights are pretty and blink with the music (they look especially impressive when we drive at night!).Her face just lights up and she moves to the music when we hand this to her after buckling her in her car seat. I'm back to buy a second one so she can use it in Gammy's car too!",5
Harmony High Chair - Windsor,This chair is such a pain to move anywhere. I would like this chair fine if I didn't want to move it around my kitchen. The brakes are constantly being pushed down by the covers of the legs and I can't get it to roll. I don't personally use the brakes yet because my daughter doesn't move it. I have been trying to contact Graco to see if this is a common problem and what they will do to fix it.,1
Skip Hop Via Messenger Diaper Bag Black,So many pocket is a blessing and a curse. &#34;Where is the phone?&#34; which pocket?

"Prince Lionheart bebePOD Flex Plus Baby Seat, Green/Kiwi","This is a very nice chair but honestly I was not able to use it much, my baby didn't like being stuck on a chair.

"Munchkin Bottle and Nipple Brush, Colors May Vary","It's a simple useful brush but the pink sponge like material at the end of the brush starts to tear and break up. We used the brush for a month and already we had to rip the sponge part off since it was breaking off into tiny pieces. Just use a simple all bristle brush to clean your babies bottles, do not buy this.",1
"BRICA Deluxe Snack Pod Stroller Drink and Snack Holder, Gray","We have a The First year (ignite stroller) and the stroller wont lock if this is on it. Other than that, its pretty convenient to have this versatile  snack pod to pull out and attach to car seat and stroller.",3
"Britax Frontier 85 SICT Booster Seat, Cardinal","I have 2 of these seats in my 2012 Prius V and they are extremely WIDE.  My prior Britax allowed a third person to set in the back, but with these, even a small child cannot easily (or safely) sit in the middle.We would NOT recommend this seat to people with cars smaller in width than a Priius V (which means that you better have an american SUV if you expect to seat 3 in the back with 2 of these seats installed.",3
Motion Sensing Sleep Sheep,"This is great. This particular model has a sound sensor which makes it a step up from the regular one, which is great also. I gave this to my daughter who just found out she is pregnant. It is gender non specific so no worries there. They did not have this model when I gave it to my older daughter for her baby. However this was a life saver for her baby (my granddaughter). No parent should be without this to help baby sleep and just to sooth when upset.",5
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I hate this product because this ""Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump"" doesn't work at all.I am breast feeding my baby from last three months and thought of buying a pump which i can use occasionally when i am out for work.I have tried to use it many times since then and there is not really any suction and certainly not enough milk to save as it takes forever to get a few drops.Frankly speaking I couldn't get even 10 drops of milk using this pump. I can't return it so the only way is to throw in trash and post pictures here so every one is aware of it that i really mean it.I do not recommend this product even for stay at home moms.Bad part about breast feeding pump is, once you opened it we cannot return it even if it is bad manufacturing product.Please dont waste your money on this crappy product.",1
"Safety 1st Wide Doorways Fabric Gate, Natural","We have a new dog in the house and I've been struggling to find an easy to use and washable fabric gate.  This one is AWESOME!  I've purchased and returned 2 other gates and this one was a last resort.  I paid more than price listed on Amazon.com and that wasn't smart, but I'm so glad to find this gate.  It is super simple to put together and install.  It's a tall gate so if you're a shorter person (I'm 5'11) you will have a hard time stepping over it with out removing.  Don't even try with another baby in your arms!  I really like the mesh so doggie can see through it.  I also love how easy it is to install.  A few twists and you're good to go.  I have a slightly off set half wall in one room where I'd like to keep the dog and I am able to use this gate very easily on the small angle.  The only thing I wish were different is the width.  I would buy 2 if it could reduce down to 36"" but it's a solid 38"" at the shortest length.",5

Sassy Bath &amp; Sun Visors,"I gave it four stars because it is what it says it is and functions correctly but it did not work for me.  As soon as I tried pouring water on my child's head, he did his usual freak out.  They do seem to help it from running directly into the child's eyes, but if they lean forward it will run off the side and into their face.",4
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,I love the design on this and it covers up everything so I don't have to worry when I'm out and about with my little one.  I'm also able to see through the top allowing me to view my baby while she's nursing and allows for an easier time maneuvering her while under the cover.,5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"you get what you pay for in price and lemme tell you it's amazing!!! BUY IT! you wont regret it...need a simple gate for stairs, or one for a fireplace, large opening, work out area like a treadmill or entertaiment center this thing works for anything!",5
ChooMee Sip'n Soft Top - Red and Purple,"These work fairly well, but like many other tips for food pouches they are not perfect.  I also ownPouchPop Topper 2 Pack for Pouch Feeding, 4 Months Plus - Red/Orange, so I will try to make a comparison of the two.Functionality: The benefit to the ChooMee tops is the little valve that prevents accidentally-on-purpose spills when baby squeezes the pouch.  The top is all one piece of silicone and the valve itself is a thin piece of silicone with a slit down the middle. PouchPop tops have no valve and baby can just squeeze the food out everywhere.  Well, both have their pro's and cons as far as the functionality.  The ChooMee tops are awesome at preventing accidental spills, but they are also really difficult to suck the food out of unless the puree is very thin (I mean watered down regular yogurt with no fruit thin).  So most of the time we end up using the PouchPop tops because even thick purees will come out of this just fine.  Because there is no valve, these allow a lot of food to flow out at one time, so young babies might have a hard time with that.Caps: The little cap on the ChooMee feeder is a nice touch.  These are great if baby doesn't eat all of the pouch at once and you don't want to take this off to replace the cap temporarily.  PouchPops do not have these.  Although this isn't a huge issue for us, my baby does sometimes get distracted by the cap hanging off of the ChooMee top and would rather play with it than eat.Staying put on Pouch: ChooMee tops push onto the food pouch and kind of ""snap"" on.  They are super easy to put on and even more easy to take off.  This has been our biggest issue with these caps.  My 12 month old is constantly taking off the cap, then the contents of the pouch spill everywhere.  The PouchPop tops screw on to the cap and have fit every pouch I've tried (squooshie refillable, infantino pouches, and store bought pouches).  These definitely win in this category because my baby cannot get the off of the pouches. Update: I recently bought theSquooshi Reusable Food Pouch | 8 Pack - G.O. Pattern | Refillable Squeeze Pouches for Kids of All Agesand the ChooMee tops are perfect for these!  It is harder to snap them on, but my baby can't get them off.  I still use PouchPop toppers more often because I tend to make thick purees that flow more easily through the PouchPop.Overall: Both are made of quality silicone material, they are super easy to clean, and work decently for their purpose.  Neither is perfect.  The ChooMee caps are probably better for younger infants (6 months and up), and the PouchPop tops are probably better for older babies (12 months and up) when the baby is better about not squeezing the pouch too hard and they can handle more food at one time.",4

Chicco Cortina KeyFit 30 Travel System in Adventure,"I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR MY NIECE AND HER HUSBAND. THEY RECEIVED IT IN 4 DAYS AFTER I ORDERED IT, AND SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT.

"Philips AVENT 2 Piece BPA Free Soothie Pacifier, 3+ months, Green","It&#8217;s still inexpensive, still easy to clean and still my toddler&#8217;s favorite. I&#8217;ve tried others and he just keeps spitting them out. My kid has good taste!",4
"Honeysuckle Breast Milk Storage Bags, 75 Ct (3 Boxes of 25 pcs)","These bags work well. No leaking issues yet and I've been using them for 2 weeks. I haven't used any of the frozen milk yet, so I can't comment on that yet. I used Lansinoh bags with my older daughter, these seem pretty equivalent.",5
Evenflo Summit Easy Walk-Thru Gate,This gate serves its purpose but not as strong as I thought.  The latch system is very inconvenient.,4
"GroVia Hybrid Hook/Loop Shell Diaper, Surf, One Size","Love these cloth diapers. Grovia really thought of everything in their design. They are simple & easy to use. The Velcro only sticks to itself, there are little tabs to stick the Velcro under for washing. The snaps (to resize) are perfectly placed & do their job. They wash really well (I'm using Charlie's Soap) with no staining & they dry really really quickly. We also use disposables for on the go convenience. I can honestly say we've had more 'blow outs' & leaks with the disposables than with the cloth. They were a little bulky looking whe she was small, but now (about 3mos) they're looking more normal. I do wish they had more colors, sometimes it's hard to match the diaper & make it look like part of the outfit.",5
"Philips AVENT Comfort Breast Shell Set, 2-Pack",The other shell sets I have seen in the past are hard and not vented very well.  These are quite comfortable and the venting is just right.,5
Levana Safe N'See Digital Video Baby Monitor with Talk-to-Baby Intercom and Lullaby Control (LV-TW501),"just got my monitor but i did a lot of research, looked at reviews and it held up to all the expectations I had. I previously had a summer infant video monitor and this one is much better. Better clarity on the screen, better options, and the reviews say is lasts longer. My Summer infant monitor the screen broke multiple times during the year i used it. I would recommend this monitor.",4
"Skip Hop Pacifier Pocket, Red",Thank the item arrived very quickly.I can think of a multitude of uses for this little bag.,4
Quick Change (TM) - Purse or Diaper Bag Organizer and Insert (black),"This is working great for me.  I'm using it in my purse for my newborn's diaper needs.  I have two bags, one actual diaper bag and my purse.  I don't like carrying both bags, plus baby, plus toddler with me.  This allows me to put baby wipes, antibacterial wipes, baggies for dirty diapers, mini Lysol, a few disposable changing kiners, and a couple of diapers in my purse in an easy to pullout and use fashion.  I keep the diaper bag in my car for refilling the supplies in my purse, and carrying extra items if I need them.  This gives me just a little more freedom and less frustration by letting me carry one less bag around.",5
Cosco Juvenile Pronto Belt-Positioning Booster Car Seat,"I ordered this car seat on-line for my granddaughter who is 2-1/2.  She had outgrown her regular car seat. She wasn't tall enough at 35-1/2 inches and 30 pounds to fit the other booster seats.  She fits perfectly in this seat.  I was concerned that it wasn't the bold pink that she's used to--but, she was really happy with the color.  Only issue that I have had--She can unbuckle the seat belt.  I had to be stringent in ensuring she understood not to unbuckle until I told her it was ok.  Overall, I've been very pleased with the product.",4
Seal 'n Go Breast Milk Bags,"I stored 5.5 days worth of milk between these Gerber Seal-n-Go bags and First Year storage bags.  Everything in the other companies bags was fine, just like previous times I used them, however I lost 52 oz worth of pumped milk that was stored in the Gerber bags.  How you ask, all of it was spoiled.  All the over 100oz of milk was handled and stored the exact same way, and only the bags of milk stored in the Gerber bags were spoiled.  Thanks a lot Gerber, for producing bags that spoil milk!!!!",1
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I bought this for my daughter who is 1 month old. The moment I put her on it, I knew, she would not be comfortable.I think, this rocker is designed for kids 1 year and above but certainly not for infants.",2

"Dream On Me 3&quot; Playard Mattress, White","Fits great in our Kolcraft playpen.  I didn't know what to expect and now feel so badly that our first child slept on just the playpen mattress.  Baby #3 will be here soon and he will be sleeping in the same playpen, as #1 and #2.  This mattress will set my heart at ease knowing his back will be supported.  It's pretty firm and the sheets the recommend for it fit perfectly (American Baby).  Great purchase for us.",5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"We originally registered for the Kick and Play, but returned it for this product. Our friend had the Kick and Play and their daughter would constantly fall over, it didn't have good head support for a newborn and was too upright. This chair is more reclined and padded better for a newborn. True, our daughter does slide down after a while of vibrating, but she stays straight and her head is supported. I also like how the strap that comes in between her legs is long enought that if we want to swaddle her in there, we can still strap her in. It would be nice if the music/vibration stayed on longer, but I think the timer also probably saves us from too many batteries when we forget to turn it off. All in all, a great product for the first few months. Allows me to eat and shower on a daily basis!",4
Philips AVENT Newborn Starter Set,"I have used Avent bottles for all 3 of my kids and am still using them for my daughter now.  I had a lot of problems in the beginning with leaks, until I figured out that the problem was only when I screwed the nipple on too tightly.  It's your natural inclination to screw it on tightly to avoid leaks, but if you do it too tight it causes the nipple to buckle under the rim and then leaks as the other parents have experienced.  Aside from that (which is easily remedied) they are easier to clean than other brands, and my babies took to them immediately.  I'm not fond of the pacifiers though - and prefer the Gerber Nuk because I can buy it at the grocery store in an emergency (and my babies all liked them better anyway).  You can use a regular dish brush to clean the bottles, too, so you really don't even need a bottle brush.  I'd just buy bottles instead of the starter set.",4
"Safety 1st Space Saver Infant Tub, Blue","We had originally gotten a Puj tub for our son (now 4 months old). We were unable to use that Puj tub in our full size kitchen sink and this is our only option as our bathroom sink is much too small. Enter the safety 1st tub. Its been great. Its a nice compact design that allows me to tuck it in when not in use. My son sits in it nicely and doesn't seem to slip around too much. There is a plug in one side which is nice if you want the baby to sit in a bit of water (not recommended) or you can leave it open and it drains as you go. There is also a nice compartment at the base where you can set your wash cloth or soap or bath toys as you are working. Overall, its more than worth this price. I would have paid twice as much for it.",4

Kolcraft Pure Sleep Therapeutic 150 Crib Mattress,"I did a good amount of comparison shopping before buying a mattress for my daughters crib.

ProGradeTM Front Load Washer-Dryer Lock by Safety 1st&reg;,"My son is 4 and he can open it, but that's not what I bought it for so I'm ok with that. I have a tiny laundry room right off of the garage and a front load washer. I'd try to leave the washer door open and every time I'd come in through the garage with an armload of groceries I'd bash my legs on that stinkin' washer door. Leaving it closed made the washer stink, so that wasn't an option either... This lock looks great (like it came with the washer) and it holds the washer door mostly closed when not in use allowing about a 1 inch gap. It's perfect! No more knee banging and no more stinky washer! Yay!!",5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","I love the whole concept of this but it's TERRIBLY made.  I purchased for my now 4month old son. I noticed the stuffing on the center one coming out so I contacted the company and they immediately sent a new one out..great! However, upon receiving the second one I checked the center piece ( mirror ) and you can see the threading is very loosely stitched sooo I am expecting the same incident to occur. I will be sending this product back because as much as I like the concept it's not worth the risk. :(",1
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","These sleep sacks are wonderful! My granddaughter used them all winter....and where we're from, it gets very cold at night.

What a wonderful idea someone came up with....sleep with no worries about the blanket covering the infant's head!",5
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Hallway Security Gate, Black","This gate is really great.  It's strong, sturdy, and semi-attractive.  We used it on the bottom of our stairs between two wooden banisters that required a gate to be wider at the top than at the bottom.  This gate can be adjusted for that situation.  It can also be installed without drilling into your walls or wood stair rails, which was very important to my husband.  It keeps baby off the stairs, and it's easy to operate.  My 3 and 5 year old kids have both figured out how to open it already, so we don't have to help them every time.",5

Britax Back Seat Mirror,I didn't need a lot of choices for a mirror to see my baby in and this works just great.  Easily installed and rotates as well.  Saved me a trip to the baby store.,5
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black",I bought this stroller to take to Disney world.  It is easy to put together.  The stroller seems to move around really well and is easy to fold up.  It isn't the lightest stroller but that does not change my opinion of the stroller.  Great product would recommend it to everyone.,5
"Chicco NextFit Convertible Car Seat, Mystique","This is our 3rd car seat that we have tried. And this one is by far the best car seat.1. When installing the car seat, it was easy to do and unlike the other car seats that we have this one is solid and does not move.2. The seat itself is comfortable, our daughter does not fight us to get in the car seat any more.3. The seat is just great and solid built!!I would tell everyone to buy this seat!",5
"Dwellstudio Stuffed Animal Plush Toy, Green Owl",I had purchased this coordinating bedding set so I figured I needed the cute owl to go along with the bedding.  This owl is small in size approx 14 inches and is cute but I believe it is very overpriced.,3
Medela Breastmilk Freezing &amp; Storage (*BPA Free) - 80ml Bottles in Retail Packaging #87061 (Pack of 12 Bottles),Personally barely ever used this size. Much better off purchasing the 4 oz storage bottles. I have a whole stock of them that I only use if I'm out of the 4 oz containers.,1
Diono Radian Angle Adjuster,This adjuster against my leather seats made my son's car seat slide back and forth. His seat was sliding and tilting so much that I thought maybe the seat belt had come undone. I checked the belt and it was as tight as could be. This adjuster does NOT work with leather seats.  SO unsafe.,1
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,"We had a different tub for our first child, and it held up well for about 3 years. This tub did not do nearly as well. With only about a year of use, the duck had to be blown up between every single bath. Due to the shape of the tub, there was less room for our child than the tub we had used with our first. In addition, the head of the duck made the tub more difficult to store in a small bathroom. We recently threw it away because we didn't want to blow it up every day.",3
"Skip Hop Moby Bath Mat, Blue","I got this for my infant who is in the process of learning to sit and his nursery theme is whales. Well this mat doesn't stick to any part of our tub. I even tied the sides to make it a picture for him to look at while in the tub and falls after a few minutes. Since it doesn't stick to the bottom it will try to float, not fun at all. The suckers on this mat are very small about the size of my thumb. I think I would of had better luck if they were bigger. Now the mat just sits on the bathroom floor unused.",2
"Planet Wise Travel Wet/Dry Diaper Bag, Outer Space","I purchased this for feminine products, but have used it for so much. The big pouch is the perfect size for toothbrush/paste and face soap and the small pouch fits all sorts of little things you need for overnights. Great buy!!",5
Baby Einstein Music and Discovery Travel Mirror,My 4 month old absolutely loves this mirror!!! It keeps his attention and makes him smile. I highly recommended this for every parent.,5
"Withings Smart Kid Scale, Wireless",We are constantly guessing on my son's length but this scale takes the guesswork out of the pounds!  I put him on it once a week and quickly get an accurate reading.  Best of all the data is instantly delivered to the app where we can see his progress week to week (it tracks each weight instead of having one wipe out the data of the previous).  Really assuring knowing he is growing on the milk that I am producing.  It came with a measuring tape but my husband and I aren't as proficient at stretching our son out and quickly measuring from head to toe like at the doc's.,5
Milkscreen: Home Test to Detect Alcohol in Breast Milk 8 Test Strips,"These strips work great!  They are easy to use.  The only downside is their cost, but once you test your breast milk a few times, you get an idea of how you metabolize alcohol so I think 8 is plenty.  Makes me feel more comfortable drinking knowing for sure that my baby is not getting any alcohol in his system.",4
"Bamboobies 2 Pair Ultra-Thin Regular Nursing Pads, Pale Pink","I have been using disposable nursing pads, but do not like the waste, crunchy sounds, or the way they bunch up.  Now that I am leaking less, I prefer washable pads.  These are the best washable pads I've ever tried!  They are very soft, thin, and absorb well without leaking.  They are still slightly visible under thin bras, but less visible than disposable or washable pads.  I also have not had any problems with sticking to these pads as I have had with other washable pads in the past.  I will be purchasing more of these and would recommend them to friends!",5
Jahgoo Baby Bath Support - White,"We own EVERY peek-a-block toy under the sun... Our sons LOVE trucks (11 month olds) and our daughter LOVES the blocks (24 month old)This trunk just HAS to be loved. Its a dump truck, and it dumps out the blocks easily. Its very durable, well it holds up to constant abuse and is always a favorite!The truck plays music when rolled, or when a peek-a-block is placed into the wheels or the drivers seat. The peek-a-blocks that come with the set are all adorable and have to do with construction--a driver block that has a rolling ball inside (twirls around)-a block with a traffic sign inside (twirls around)-a block with sand inside (rattles around)-a block with rocks inside (rattles around)-a block with traffic cones inside (rattles around)They are all cute and fun as rattles for my 11 month old twins. My daughter LOVES ""peeking"" (pun intended) inside and identifying what they are...This toy is more than just a truck, its THE truck to have for any baby/toddler",5
"Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Navy/Red","These straps are great for most items. But they do not fit around sippy cups. And the """"girl colors"""" are almost twice the price. I would buy again if the price were better and they have snap size options.",4
"Summer Infant Swaddleme Microfleece, Pink Bubbly, Small/Medium",I bought it as a gift to my sister-in-law and she liked it a lot. I have the same poduct in a different color and had 3 babies go through it; it really helped them sleep on the back.,5
"Summer Infant 3 Piece SwaddleMe Muslin Blanket, Go Team",Love this product I'm still using this swaddle blankets on my 3 month old. They are light and breathable. The price is amazing for these.,5
"Luvable Friends Flannel Fitted Crib Sheet, Yellow Circle",Good quality and my 20 month old son loved his car sheets. I couldn't find flannel crib sheets in the store.,5
"Boon Frog Pod Bath Toy Scoop,Green",We have only been using this for a week but we love it. When I first got it as a shower gift I did not want to permanently stick it to my wall so we ordered the suction cup attachment and it works great.  All of our toys drain well and so far are mildew free.,5
Mommy's Helper Cushie Traveler,"I was a little hesitant about getting this but I am really glad I did! My little girl (2) is terrified of those huge public bathroom seats and cries every time! I wasn't sure how this seat would work on them but I am grateful that they do! Make sure the seat is positioned on the BACK of the toilet for support. It seems to be of pretty good construction and materials and my girl loves that it's padded! It comes with a carrying case which my daughter now calls her potty purse and is happy to go to the bathroom. That is a big breakthrough during the potty training stage! Would recommend, and even if it doesn't last more than 6 months at a time I will still buy another. It's cheaper than pull ups and now that she uses the public bathrooms we can go out in normal big girl underwear!",5
"Delta 48 Piece Nursery Storage Set, Green",The storage set was exactly what I was looking for! The organizer was a bit smaller than my expectation but it is perfect for what I need. The hangers are a good quality and the bins are nice.,4
"Babe Ease Original Clean Diner, Blue Zoo","It looks much better in the picture.  It is not worth the money and just a big hassle trying to keep it together.  It is very loose and comes apart very easily.  I tried shrinking it with no luck, I tried using duct-tape to make it tighter so it wouldn't fall off and loosen up-- all with no success.  The high-chair in wonderful, but the cover is worthless!!",1
"Luvable Friends 2-Pack Swaddler Cotton Receiving Blankets, Blue","I purchased these blankets for my little baby boy.  In addition to being adorable, they are perfect for warm weather. I intend to buy more of these as baby shower gifts.",5
"MamaDoo Kids Foldable Play Yard Mattress Topper, Blue","Graco pack and play has small quanity of padding on mattress. This added more cushion and is firm enough for baby. It fits perfectly in his porta crib, no gaps no spaces. Worth the price for the safety of this alone. American Baby Co porta crib sheets (purchased at Amazon) fit very well. Very happy with this purchase.",5
NUK Milk Bag Storage Rack,"I got this product and was amazed at how terrible it was! It doesn't fit together, i tried and and figured my hands just weren't strong enough to put it together so I gave it to my husband. The slots didn't match up and my 6'2'' husband couldn't put it together either. Go to target and get a storage bin before this pathetic product!",1
Totseat - Stripe in Blue,"Although this is something that was intended to have our child sit with us at the dinner table, we have put it to good use and designated it as a time-out chair. We love it. lol",5
"Fisher-Price Newborn-To-Toddler Rocker, Animal Fun","We had twins born at 28 weeks.  When they came home, they were still very small and suffered from severe reflux.  These chairs (we bought 2!) were a life saver!  They could not sleep flat for the first few months due to reflux and other issues, making this chair the perfect angle.  They rested very comfortably in these chairs.  And, the portability was a huge bonus.An added plus is that the vibration does not cut off.  In the baby papasans, the vibration cuts off, often waking the baby after just 20 minutes.  Also, when the babies caught a cold, the doctor recommended they sleep at an incline.  The chairs were perfect.  It was easy to transition them to the crib when they were older, although they still use these for naps at 6 months corrected age.One downside is that our babies heads were still too floppy in the beginning.  I added a head roll designed for a preemie in a car seat.  We never used the toy.",5
"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch","In the process of getting a refund on this unit.  Problems with the first unit.  Samsung sent a new unit.  Issues with the replacement.  Save yourself time and pick another monitor.  Samsung is a pain to deal with.  Won't answer phone calls, etc.",1
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","This seat is perfect for older bigger kids. The install is incredibly simple and only takes a few seconds. The only not perfect thing about this seat is the booster mode. The booster mode is for very big kids , probably 8 and up. So if you put your 5 yr old in it in booster mode the lap belt is NOT going to fit him correctly. It will be against his tummy not his hips and thighs . This problem is fixed with the britax secureguard. Britax charges 20$ for secureguard, but if you tell britax that they should send you one under warranty they will give it to you free.",4
Organic Ergo Baby Carrier - Cranberry/Caramel,"I love this carrier.  Very soft fabric, my daughter seems very comfortable and the hood holds her head well when she falls asleep.",5
Planet Wise Diaper Wet Bag - Medium (Mocha Sunrise),"So great that it turned out that my diaper service provides one, too! Incredibly useful to have with cloth diapers and on holidays where baby may accidentally wet through his clothes.",5
"Munchkin Click Lock 2 Count Trainer Cup, 7 ounce","Parent use: Locking lid is easy to use. The rubber/silicone piece can be difficult to remove for cleaning. The bottle itself is not an easy cleaner because of its shape. Small particles can get trapped in its curves.Child use: Child must bite and suck to get the beverage through the spout. Not an easy switch to this trainer cup from a bottle/breast. It is generally light and easy to hold. Great teether!It is not our preferred cup overall. I do love that everything is simple with no extra ""stop leak"" piece to clean. I lean towards these types of cups when shopping, but not this brand (because it is so difficult to clean)",3
"FunBites Shaped Food Cutter Set, Green/Pink",Makes fun shapes out of boring peanut butter sandwiches. My kids love it and I do too! We are very happy with this product and I would recommend it to friends.,5
Primo Ducka Toilet Set Reducer (White),"This was the perfect solution for my niece. Every other potty we have purchased or looked at had been too much like a toy for her to take seriously, she would end up carrying them around filled with other toys or putting her stuffed animals on them to pretend but never used them herself. This is a nice balance of cuteness and functionality. It looks somewhat like a real adult toilet seat only smaller and more engaging thus she has approached its introduction in a completely different manner than before. We are using this directly on the porcelain and when not in use it goes on the shelf behind the toilet so she knows it is a bathroom only object. The seat itself is sturdy, it stays put without the pins, it is easy to wipe down or rinse in the tub and the duck design (I personally think it looks more like a penguin) is gender neutral so my nephew will be able to use it as well.",5
Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Wide Neck Newborn Feeding Set,"Help a friend buy, specify brand suit",5
"Summer Infant Sure and Secure Double Bedrail, Blue","We researched bed rails and were ready to give up.  The reviews for bed rails were horrible! So many reviews we read talked about the danger involved with bed rails, the way children get trapped and such.  Finally we decided to try this brand, and are very happy we did!  The bed rails are perfect!  When we placed the rails on the box spring, about to place the mattress on top, I remember looking at how flimsy the rails seemed and I couldn't imagine them staying in place! I was wrong! The rails fit nice and SNUG-NO GAPS, NO MOVING, VERY STURDY! Keeps our child safe each night. I would definitely recommend these bed rails.",5
"Safari Evergreen Jungle Tree Wall Decals, Jungle Stickers with Green Leaves and Vinyl Tree","We purchased these wall decals for the playroom, and couldn't be happier. The decals are very colorful and easy to apply.",5
"Skip Hop Wall Decals, Treetop Friends",This decal is really cute and was the perfect thing to finish off our nursery.  Be warned it does not come in a single piece for simple application! The pieces are cut out individually and have to be applied leaf by leaf. It took HOURS!! Luckily it looks so amazing it was worth it.,5
First Communion Confirmation Religious Bracelet with Red Cross on Blue Background He Lives Charm,I got this to commemorate my granddaughter's First Holy Communion. It is a great way to preserve the memory of this event for her.,5
Graco AirBooster Youth Car Seat in Cafe Brown,"very comfortable for my 5-yr old. She said it feels good to sit on it, the seat does not get too hot and it's very easy to clean.",5
Xpress Trainer Pro-All In One-Real Simple Potty Training Round/Standard Family Toilet Seat,These seats are outstanding!  My kids love them.  They are very sleek and comfortable for all of us.  I've had other seats before that were much more expensive but they didn't compare at all to these.  The best thing is that we don't have to remove the training seat after the kids are done using them.  All we do is lift it up.  They are much more sanitary and the kids can use them easily.  I will never again be without these seats!  Thank you so much for creating a wonderful product.,5
The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier,My wife and I found  this nail clipper very useful. The magnifier is really an invention; your baby can't get hurt!,4
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This gate is at the bottom of my stairs.  It wasn't quite wide enough so I screwed blocks of 2x4s into the wall for the extra couple inches rather than shell out any more money for a wider gate.  I love it. The natural wood looks good (granted no gate is ""designer"" ha) and it operates easily.  I carry the vaccum cleaner and big suitcases up and down the stairs and wanted a gate to give me a large threshold.  I also like it easily pops off its hinges but leaves the hardware in teh wall for when family is in town or what have you.Installation was simple with the template and we got a solid install with the wood against the wall.  It sure was tested a lot this weekend during a 2 year old birthday party, but the gate won.  I would highly recommend",5
Podee Baby Feeding System,"I've never seen a system like this and it was AWESOME for our child who had colic. It also-- and maybe this isn't something to admit-- gives you a bit of freedom to walk away. They're equally capable of managing their own bottle as they are capable of managing their own pacifier, as the Podee actually changes the bottle concept to exactly that. I'm sure you've seen people prop bottles up so that they can walk away once in a while; that's not safe and makes a mess. The podee is safe and clean.I give this as a gift to all new parents. I strongly feel that everyone should at least try it out.It was a bit weird to clean, though. Not horrible or impossible, just a bit weird.",5
"Zooper Toy Bar for Rocker, Red",See my review of the rocker too if you're thinking about ordering this.  I think your money would be better spent on something else... and what kind of a baby seat doesn't come w/ the toy bar... especially for the price of the seat.,2
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",This was a great gift for the baby.  He really likes sitting in it.  I loved the looks of it and size.,5
Bummis Reusable Fleece Liners,These are great for when I am at home and don't want the waste all over the diaper. Wouldn't use on the go.,4
"Summer Infant CushyStraps, Pink",These straps are cute and cuddly and were perfect for my newborn. They are easy to use and look really cute. The fabric is soft against delicate skin and they are well priced.,4
"Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake Wall Frame, White","I have used this set for two of my older children, but the moment I opened the foil package this time I sensed something was wrong.  The material was not at all ""tacky"" and a bit too gooey.  I had trouble removing it from the package and I tried kneading as instructed but it stuck all over the rolling pin that is provided.  I just flattened it by hand (guess my hands somehow are nonstick after years of extensive dishwashing), but when I pressed it against my baby's foot it was too gooey and stuck to his poor little foot and made a mess.  It was hard to get off.  Have to return this one.  It's too bad I can't just get new molding clay because I would have liked to just keep the frame if possible.Update:  contacted company via email and they said they would send new clay ASAP.  Happier now and hope the new clay works.",3
Sassy Illumination Station,Good highchair toy. Not as good as the other sassy suction toys. The light up bulb makes it lopsided so it doesn't spin well.,3
"Baby Trend Double Snap N Go Stroller Frame, Black","We bought the baby trend double snap n go thinking we were not going to get much use out of it.  However, to date it is the best investment that we have made.  Our twins are now almost 4 months old and we use the snap n go all the time to go to doctor visits, grandma's house, restaurants, etc.  It hardly takes up any room and it's easy to open and fold.  It's very easy to move the babies in this because you don't have to keep taking them out of their car seat into the stroller and it's much more lightweight then the travel systems out there.  We are very satisfied with our purchase.",5
Lily's Home Starry Night Projector and Sound Shooter. With 6 Lullabies and 4 Nature Sounds. Large LCD Alarm Clock,doesn't have a volume switch and the time fades in and out.  it's very cheaply made and is only battery operated!,1
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","My baby boy loved this thing because of the mobile. No matter how bad things got, no matter how old he was, it ALWAYS calmed him down, during the worst teething and everything. The motor NEVER ran out on me, perhaps because I didn't use it for hours at a time (babies should only be in it about 30-45 minutes when they are young and awake, and only a few hours while asleep because they need to move and grow and not get a flat head). My son is 9 month old now, 22 lbs, 29 inches and he still loves the mobile and still fits in it, but unfortunately is too big and mobile to be in it safely anymore. So it breaks my heart but I will need to sell it as that time has passed.The only thing that I hated about this was that we had to stop using the safety straps by about 3-4 months because my son (who was a big baby) grew too fast, but this is an issue with other Fisher Price products too. The straps are removable though so you can probably just buy some more. If my baby was less of a &#34;stare at stuff and observe quietly&#34; baby this wouldn't have worked or been safe enough for him. Babies like my first, my daughter, who are very extremely active will likely grow out of this sooner but my son was very peaceful in this thing from day one and it is still in great condition.",5
"Secure-A-Toy, BLACK-WHITE",We have a Maclaren pram and due to no bar to attach items to- we were forever picking up fallen toys. Not anymore- we even use them at restaurants to attach to a high chair.,5
"Soothing Dreams Monistor with Remote Control, Fisher-Price","This monitor may have a nice appearance, and nice features, but it is the worst product I have ever dealt with. I was completely shocked, seeing that it is a Fisher Price item. The night show is nice, the music is nice, and all the features are nice-if they worked! The first time my baby cried, it turned on by itself-which I thought was great. Until her screams persisted, and it would turn off, then on again, then off again. If I turn it on, and she cries, it goes off. Last night, I went to turn it on quickly because I saw she was waking, as soon as I touched the &quot;Soothe&quot; button, she let out a wail and it turned off. When it does stay on, it stays on for 5 minutes. Also, the most important feature does not work- I cannot hear anything going on in her room. I originally had the Safety 1st Grow with me monitor, but it unfortunately broke, so I figured I'd try this one. With the Safety 1st monitor, I could hear what was going on outside, I could hear her breathing, I could hear what was going on in the room next to it. With this one, I cannot hear anything until her screams are loud. Even with her wailing, I have an annoying clicking noise that prevents from hearing anything that can actually be heard out of this monitor. The power switch is hard to turn on; it is just a horrible product that I would not recommend to anyone. There are other ways to get a light show and music or sounds. I have the environment sounds machine, and I can do without the night show-it didn't even interest my baby.",1
"Chicco Smart Support Backpack, Red","We purchased this carrier for our trip to Ft Davis, Texas where a lot of hiking is involved. My husband, who is 6ft 2in. had no problem with it at all. It fit him perfectly and he said it was very comfortable. Also our 1 year old daughter who weighs 21 lbs. loved riding up high and being able to see everything. The only down side to it is there is little storage space but that really wasn't a problem for us seeing as I had a back pack with me that carried all of our 5 kids things in it. So all in all a good product at a good price. I would recommend it to anyone.",5
"Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey","I didn't purchase this from Amazon, but I'm reviewing anyway.I bought this in gray about a year ago, but have only been using it regularly for about 3 months. Prior to that, it had only been used about once a month.In the last 2 weeks, it got this huge, huge crack in it, about halfway through the whole seat. And it keeps getting worse, so I need to replace it. I'm kind of disappointed. I liked it, even though I don't think the bottom is easy to clean at all, and it *seemed* durable enough to last for years. (I even bought it gender neutral, planning on many kids of use with it!) Everyone I know has had the same potty seat for like 15 years through many children and it's still holding up - except for this one.Not replacing it with the same one. It's not worth it, especially since I see other people complaining about the same thing.",1
"Dream On Me 3&quot; Playard Mattress, White","We both this for our Chicco pack and play...it fit perfectly!!  I noticed my son sleeps MUCH better with this mattress, compared to the one that comes with the pack and play.  I found that the Carters Velour Playard Fitted Sheet fit perfectly on the mattress.  I actually bought another fitted sheet because I was worried the carters sheets would be too small, but they ended up fitting just fine! :)",5
"C.R. Gibson Loose-Leaf Memory Book, Baby Bots",This is a well made and super cute baby book. It has an adorable design and is well organized as well.,5
"NUK Trendline Animal Prints Learner Cup, Girl, 5 Ounce, 2-Count","We were really struggling with out 12 month old to convert her to sippy cups. These have the silicon top so it is closest to the feel of nipples, I guess, so they worked wonders to get her converted. At 15months she is now using straws! Only drawback is they don't convert to straws...",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","This was the only playpen we could find that was large enough to use for twins.  We have used this for our babies ever since they came home from the hospital as preemies.  We leave it set up in our kitchen.  Now that they are 5 months old, they love all the bright colors and interactive toys (mirror, rattling things.)  I also put them in it for naps during the day.  It is also great for tummy time.  I have taken out the bottom mat and placed it on the hardwood floor so we can play together.  Another great feature is that it packs up nicely for travel.  I'm very glad we made the purchase.",5
Boppy Water Resistant Protective Cover,THIS IS A GOOD QUALITY PRODUCT. AND IT FEELS SO SOFT ON THE SKIN TOO... CAN BE USED AS SLIPCOVER ALREADY.,5
Kalencom Potette Plus Liners - 30 Liners,These along with the potty they are meant for work great.  They hold a large amount of liquid without spilling or smelling.  I leave these in my car with the potty for times when you can't just pull up to a bathroom right now.,5
*SPECIAL PROMOTION*The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Honey - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),"So as much as I love all things natural, we were very skeptical about this product.  We hail from mother russia where amber is abound and everyone had amber necklaces and loves natural things, but i've never heard of this particular use of amber.We had about 20-30 bibs for our 8 month old baby because he was drooling so much and i couldn't do laundry every single day.  he would be covered in drool within a few hours without this necklace.  it completely stopped once he started wearing the necklace (we put it on his foot, covered by socks).  so we though that he might have naturally outgrown his teething pain.  every time we would leave the necklace off incidentally, he would start drolling like crazy!  hence our conclusion that this thing really works!  also i've let him put it into his mouth and chew on it (with my supervision) and it hasn't broken.  i don't let him do it extensively but nice that i always have a teething toy for him, even if i had forgotten to bring an actual toy ;)best.  thing.  ever.",5
Baby Einstein Bendy Ball,I am not really sure what it does but my baby cousin takes it everywhere.  (I have allot of cousins) He finds lots of ways to squish and pull it.,5
Hudson Baby Plush Blanket with Satin Trim and Backing,"While this is a soft blanket with the much appreciated full satin backing, the fuzzy side gets fuzz all over.  Fuzz in the babies fingers, toes, mouth, etc... I have washed it several times hoping to alleviate this problem but so far, still getting fuzz everywhere.  Not a fan.",2
"Delta Childrens Products Canton Dressing Table, Black","Save your money.  The drawers do not line up and one of my bars fell apart.  I am placing a call this morning to see how ridiculous the cost will be to return it.  I have put together several pieces of furniture and have never experienced the problems I have with this.  I'm not sure how it would look if the support bar would not have broken, but for now it looks cheap and not very sturdy.",1
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"I don't need (want) to hear every little noise my baby makes, but when a noise is made, if the room I am in has more than a refrigerator running I can't hear the cries.  The lights are the only cue I have that anything is happening in the baby room.  I did adjust the sensitivity/volume, but even at the highest setting it is useless.  I am disappointed after reading a few good reviews here and recommend from Consumer Reports. :(",1
Spielstabil Nesting Stacking Cups,I wanted a safe material and good colors that would nest and stack. This does the job perfectly. They can go in the bath too.,5
"Baby Einstein Press and Play Pal Toy, Neptune","My three year old chose this at the store to give to her little sister who was, then, 10 months old.  The little one has loved it since the minute she got it (the Panda).  She lights up when she sees it, she carries it around while she toddles, she pats it, kisses it, etc.  Its a big win at our  house.",5
2 Inch Foam Bassinet Mattress - 15&quot; x 30&quot; x 2&quot;,This mattress is very firm and waterproof (ideal for a newborn baby). I bought it to replace the flimsy &#34;mattress&#34; that came with my sons delta bassinet. Fits perfectly,5
Fisher-Price Tree Party Cozy Cocoon Bouncer,I received this item and it is as cute as it shows in the picture. It was easy to put together and the cover was soft.  The only thing I did not like was that they sent it in the Fisher Price box and it was dirty from shipping.,5
"Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman, Cognac/Khaki",It's comfortable for the 5 people in our house. It glides easily. Cushion cleans up easily. Fairly easy to assemble..,5
"JJ Cole Collections Storage Box, Cocoa Stripe, 6.5&quot;","Very nice, well constructed attractive storage box. Although you can collapse it down, it is not flimsy and does not fold in on its self. I would recommend this.",5
"Thirsties Diaper Cover, Celery, X-Small (6-12 lbs)",A Must have for cloth diapered babies! The Leg Gussets are a great feature of these covers and help to hold all the wetness in. I have never had a leak with these and my daughter is now 6 months old not one leak yet and she is sleeping through the night so by morning she is super wet and still no leaks. They also wash very well on gentle cycle and I line dry them and have no problems I just toss them in with my diapers. In addition to that the inside is wipeable so you do not have to wash all the time just when they start to smell. I cannot recommend these enough. A+++!,5
Britax B-Agile Stroller Child Tray,My niece bought the stroller and I helped with the tray. I am sure it will be used a lot.,5
Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature 2-in-1 Bottle &amp; Nipple Cleaner (Green),"Brush arrived on time, packaged well, exactly as described. Work great when cleaning Tommeee Tippee bottles, bristles seem to be a lot softer than the other bottle brushes that I have tried. Also, the shape of these work better for the shape of the Tommee Tippee bottles.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son is only beginning to potty train, but he instantly felt comfortable with this seat.  I had purchased a construction truck potty for him because he likes that sort of thing, and he thought it was neat, but he hated to sit on that potty.  I failed to realize how important comfort and feeling secure are in the potty training process.  He was successful the first time he sat on this potty and tried to pee!  Great product!",5
"Kalencom On the Go Potty, Blue",I bought this for my little girl who was potty training and we were going on a trip to North Dakota.  It was wonderful!  I highly recommend this product.  She felt comfortable sitting on it and it comes with it's on bag and we just keep it in the van.  Perfect!,5
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Glass Bottle 2-Pack, 3.5 oz","These are a bit more costly but are BPA free bottles.  IMO, worth it!",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,I think this is my first time actually writing a review.  I always read them but never take the time to leave feedback.  I purchased this based on all the good reviews that it received and I couldn't be happier.  We have an elongated toilet and it was very hard to find a potty seat that fit it.  This is the only one that I have found to fit perfectly. So glad I bought it!,5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink","My 4 and 6 year olds love soup for lunch.Keeps it warm till lunch, neither has trouble opening or putting the lid back on.Buying more.",5
Electronic Digital Caliper 6&quot; with Extra large LCD Display Screen with Carrying Case,Back in college only the privileged kids had those fancy Mitutoyo digital calipers.  Fast forward to 2010 and these things have become accessible to the masses not just the well-to-do.  People at work teased me for $14 SE calipers until we tested in with gauge blocks and it was dead nuts accurate! The boss went and bought a boat load of these puppies for everyone and we use them daily.  Incredible value!  Am I a nerd for reviewing digital calipers?  Yes.,5
"Bumkins Junior Bib, Blue Fizz","A little larger, but works great over his clothes in the winter and even over the straps of the highchair. Cleans up nice also.",5
"Bright Starts Sunnyside Activity Center, Safari Saucer","Arrived in package, brand new with all parts wrapped in plastic.  But not all the parts were there.  One of them being the all important seat.",1
"Ameda Store N Pour Breast Milk Storage Bags with Adapter, 20-Count","These bags and the hook attachment are my favorite of many brands.  They connect to many types of pumps (I used mine with Medela).  Easy one step pump and storage, and I love the tear off pour spout.  So much nicer than opening a gripper seal and trying not to spill such precious milk!  I don't produce more than 5oz a side so I love the smaller 5oz size.  Larger milk producers might not be happy with them though.",5
"Graco Affix Highback Booster Seat with Latch System, Atomic",I have never really understood the loose booster - I just feel like it isn't as safe if it doesn't attach to the car via the latch system.  This attaches via the latch system and is super easy to install.  It has a nice cup holder and it fits my child well.  I have seen some negative comments about the latches not been equally tight but we have not experienced that.,5
Phil &amp; Teds Cushy Ride Main Seat - Pink,"We got this in hopes that it would help my 3 yr-old to warm up to the new double stroller when the baby arrived.  She does love having a pink seat and it doesn't get as hot as the black stroller fabric did (before we added this), so that's a plus.  My least favorite thing about this is the construction - it's a SPONGE.  I live in Denver where it hardly rains, but when it does and this ""cushy ride"" seat gets wet it takes DAYS for it to dry.  You have to disconnect it from the stroller and lay it out in the sun or it won't dry at all.  If you live in a wet climate and/or leave your stroller outside on occasion, you should know this in advance.  Also, it's HOT pink.  My daughter loves it so I don't really care, but it's pretty obnoxious looking.  We got the olive green version for the baby seat in back - it's also pretty ugly.",3
"Britax Boulevard 65 TSIP Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","Great Car seat!  I did A LOT of research!  This is a big, but not too big, cushy carseat that I will keep rear facing as long as possible for further safety precautions.  The head rest is great for my son.  He never falls asleep face down, he can always lean against the head rest.",5
"Maclaren Quest Sport Stroller, Limited Edition, Denim","Maclaren has an excellent line of strollers, light-weight, durable, easy to use and fashionable! Its so easy to open and close, which is perfect when you have to hop from the train to the bus or even when exiting via stairs. Such a great product with a great price!",5
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Mocha Butterfly","This works great for our small space. I normally don't even use the try, I just put the baby in it and pull it close to the dining table when we all eat together.  Been using it since before she could sit. At 4 months.  I also got one for my Mother's house, so when we go there, she is set. You can order additional chair covers for when in the wash. As many people said, the only thing is that it is hard to clean the straps and they do get food on them right away.",4
Munchkin Baby Care Cart,"I bought this cart to store baby's stuff at her grandparents' house.I assembled it pretty quickly without any problems.It's sturdy enough for us, since we don't use it 24/7, but I don't think it would be fit to be used on an everyday basis.Also my daughter likes to use it as a walker and pushes it around the room.All in all I don't regret buying it and am happy with it.",4
Gerber 2 Pack Cotton Knit Fitted Crib Sheets Pink/White Daisy Design,"I loved them,  they are soft and comfortable. Although, I would have preferred if they were thicker.",4
Cuisinart CS-6 Baby Bottle Sterilizer,I love this bottle sterilizer. it cleans the bottles perfectly. The only downsize is the size of the product. Other than that is a great product.,5
"Gerber 4 in 1 Diaper Bag, Brown","I've been using the diaper bag for 7 month now and is recomendable since it fits everything I need, and the accesories come in handy, specially the changer.The pockets on the sides are perfect for baby bottles, and the compartments have been very useful for different things a baby needs.",4
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,"I must agree with the negative reviews of this item. I received a pack of these pump and save bags as a gift and was planning on using them once I returned to work. But after reading the reviews, decided on a trial run at home before returning to work and am so glad I did because I will not be using them and would not recommend these bags for the following reasons:1. small opening makes it difficult to insert the adapter into the bag and even more difficult to hook onto the two holes in the bag.2. bag material is stiff. While it is understandable that it needs to be stiff enough to stand up on its own, the stiff material makes it difficult to expand for breast milk to fill without having to manually expand the bag.3. zip lock is difficult to seal. The ziplock is one color (I guess I'm used to Ziplock bags with colors to indicate correct seal) so it is difficult to tell if the bag is sealed correctly. The ziplock is also very stiff and doesn't click in easily. These both contribute to spillage if you are not careful.4. small and tapered bag design. The bags only hold 5 ounces and because of the bag design, with only 4 ounces, it was difficult to squeeze out the air pockets without also squeezing out breast milk.5. takes up space in the fridge. These bags were designed to stand up on their own but this also means that they will take up more space in the fridge.My recommendation: save yourself the headache, save your tears from crying over spilled breast milk and ditch the Medela pump and save bags. Lansinoh bags are larger and much easier to use.",1
"green sprouts Cool Calm Press, Turtle","These little guys are super cute and cold when you first take it out of the freezer but they don't last very long. My kids have a short tolerance for ice cold things when they get a bump, so it's ok for me. They like the designs of them so they let me put it on them for a short while.",4
The Peanut Shell Stretch Cotton Sling in Pink Couture - Medium,"This is a really great item for my newborn who fusses - if she won't nod off  (or gets the hiccups), I carry her around in it and she ALWAYS falls asleep.  The only caution is that I ordered a larger size thinking it would be more comfortable for me, however, the sling hangs too low and bounces around alot rather than being more snug fitting like the photo.  Definitely don't upgrade a size!  Even so, it still works well for me but will take a toll on your back after a while.  We also have the Baby Bjorn which is great as well for my husband, I recommend having both options for different reasons (flexibility, different features).",4
Baby Bib - Elmo Loves Me,Very cute but neck is so stretched out after minimal use that food gets all over clothes and neck. Pretty much useless at this point.,3
"Philips AVENT Thermal Gel Pads, 2-Pack","I haven't actually used these as warming pads, because they can't go in the microwave and take longer to prepare than microwaving a wet rag. However, the are amazing from freezer and the terrycloth cover is a nice addition.",5
"Summer Infant Character Change Pad Cover, Butterfly Ladybug",high in quality. very soft. my little one likes it :).solves the purpose and easy to clean this item.,5

Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,"We just got this for a baby gift and had to return it for something else. We had the old model with our 2nd son and loved it,  especially when the lights projected on the ceiling!!But this new one does not have this feature and we were not impressed at all, it is just not as great as the oringal one.I guess new is not always better!We took it back and got one with moving birds that project light and music on the ceiling called FLUTTERBY DREAMS by another company, which both us and baby love alot better.",1
"Bobee Diaper Stacker / Diaper Caddy / Wipe Dispenser Award Winning Diaper Organizer for Baby Nursery (Customizable, includes Colorful Decals - Dispenser comes WHITE)","Wow, Why didn't someone think of this a long time ago (kind of like roller luggage)? With twin boys we have one less arm. This is a great product even with one baby, but with multiples it's mandatory! They should hand these out at at the hospital.  This will be the gift that we give to all our friends and family with newborns- We will be very popular. We also liked the way we could decorate it to fit our kids room. Very ingenious and it works.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I really didn't want a big, ugly high chair to deal with, especially after so many people lamented the clean up. This booster seat is a great value and it totally comes apart for easy cleanup. I am so glad because I mystified by how the food ends up where it does. I haven't taken this to use at a restaurant yet so can't speak to portabilty, etc. But it is pretty compact and easy to use so I can't imagine it would be too difficult. And my 6-month loves sitting up in it and banging on the table tray - yay! It appears to be safe and sturdy, even when he lunges to one side, it stays put (he's 20 lbs.). All in, a good deal.",5
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I like this tub for the same reasons other moms like it; the infant sling worked great!  We received two tubs at my shower, so we keep one at home and one at my mother-in-law's home.  She has this one, and I noticed that it was easier than the one I have at home because she has support from both sides.  We have to put not too much water since she has started to splash all over the place. So we started to give her baths in the bathroom  tub.  My daughter seems to enjoy it, so I would recommend it to others out there.",4
"Luvable Friends Thank Heaven 5-Pack Baby Bib Set, Blue","I liked this bib set. They're not waterproof bibs as expected. The fabric seems to be resitant so far. I've washed them a several times now and they still look fine (same shape, same colours).",4
"Evenflo Nurture Infant Car Seat, Button Floral","The carrying handle could use another adjustment setting & the canopy needs a piece of plastic on the back side of it so it can be more functional in shading the baby. Without the support in the back of the canopy it can only be used in the one position depicted in the photo. Other than those few things, it is very cute but not overly girly.  The fabric makes it easy to just wipe messes away so you dont have to take cover off & wash it as often.",3
"Camera Photo Floor Prop Faux Fur Artificial Fur, Newborn Baby Photography Props, Basket Stuffer Blanket - Baby Props, Basket Fabric (White Rossette)","I pulled this blanket out of the package and fell in LOVE! It is SO soft :) It's a little thin, but it's perfect for baby photography which is what I'm using it for, so I don't mind that it's thin. It's the perfect size, and just ahhh I want to put it on my own bed! Highly recommend.",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units,"Wow, these are SO great!  If you're trying to decide between the ones with one or two parent units, get two!  My hubby and I use them as &#34;walkie talkies&#34; quite often.  It's nice to be able to update each other as to what's going on in the other room, and when I'm working in the basement I can hear and then push to talk to my boys upstairs!I have zero complaints about these monitors, and the price cannot be beat!",5
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"These bibs are great.  My sister uses them for both my nieces and so I knew I would get it for my little one.  They are easy to put on, take off, clean, and I love how the shape holds and catches food, unlike the other flimsy bibs.  The only thing is that it's not as compact but I still bring it with me when I travel because I just love it.",5
"Dream On Me 3&quot; Playard Mattress, White",I was afraid of getting this because of comments about chemical smells. There was no chemical spell. It had a slight new plastic smell but nothing crazy. It makes the PNP a lot more comfortable and she now sleeps in it all night. :) So this was kind a life saver.,5
"Black Large Tuxedo Bib, Frenchie Mini Couture","This bib is so cute, love to use it when we go out to parties.  It is soft and comfortable so my little one isn't trying to take it off.",5
"Disney Winnie the Pooh First 5 Years Keepsake Baby Memory Book, H for Hunny",I love memory books like this one. I have to have one for each of my kids and the 5year books are perfect for keeping track of their growth and cute memories. I recommend this product.,5
"Sassy Rattlin Rings, Blue/Black",Cute colors for a small baby learning to grab toys. The sounds are very soft and fun to play with.,5
Born Free Wide Neck Glass Bottle - 5oz,"Once you get past the likelihood that you'll break one or two, you'll absolutely love glass bottles.  These are easy to clean and the heat super fast in the bottle warmer.  I've found that with their plastic counterparts, they take an eternity to heat up.  In addition to that, you're not risking giving your baby something that later on down the road someone will discover that it's toxic.",5
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,"Happy with this purchase.  Good construction, easy installation and easy to use. Bought 2.",5
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty","Easy to install, easy to use, and best of all our child is comfortable and safe. Used both with 'Latch,&#34; install as well as the belt, both are very easy and straight forward to use. Yes this is a high end seat/brand and the look and quality of construction mirror that. Would I buy it again, yes, in a heartbeat.Seems a lot is buyers review I read before purchasing put this in the middle of the seat, and it is big so if that is what you intend to do be aware that your passengers on either side will not have a lot of room. That decreased space is likely to be the case with just about all of the seat that have beefed up side-impact cushioning. As a front-facing seat, it is very easy to get in and out of and visibility is great. However in rear-facing access to get your kid in is tight at least with a gen 2-3 Prius. In an SUV or full size car I do not think this would be as much of an issue.For anyone looking to by US made,  while Recaro is a German company this seat is made in Michigan. Even if this is not the seat you choose please remember that even the lower cost options passed the same tests to be certified.",5
"Playtex Playtex Baby Anytime Twist 'n Click 9 Ounce Spout Cup, 2ct (Colors Vary)",This is a newer design for this cup. The top pops off when your child drops the cup and it constantly leaks. There are markings to closely follow to &#34;lock&#34; the top into place but even when you do so it leaks. I bought 5 sets of them because I love the older design but I hate this new one!,1
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","The Dr. Brown's bottles have been a lifesaver for us.  We were using the Avent wide necks and our son was really gassy and choking on the nipples.  I had received some of these at a baby fair during my pregnancy.  We switched over and within 12 hours, he was a different baby.  I have learned the hard way about how to stop leaks with these bottles.  DON'T throw away the little white disks that come with them.  You'll need them to travel with these bottles or your diaper bag will be soaked.  ALWAYS loosen the cap when warming.  As for cleaning, I just take them apart and put them in my dishwasher.  They hold up well.",5
"Sip and Smile Spill Proof Cup 2 Handle Cup Design, 7 Ounce, 2 Pack, Colors May Vary","We used Avent bottles and hoped to transition to them as a sippy cup.  However, my son was more interested in chewing on it, then attempting to drink.  I put it away and would pull it out to try for a week or two with no luck, so I gave in and bought these sippy cups - liking the soft spout and angled neck. It took a week or two to get him to stop chewing on the handles (he loves that rubber texture) and he now has the hang of the cup quite well.  I even got him to drink his formula from here today - which is monumental.  I think it may be easier to ween him off the bottle than I thought.  Every child has a preference - and I'm glad to have found one that work for my son.  Note, I have taken the valve out - so yes, it can spill.  But it is much easier for him that way.  Additionally, he is learning that he can not ""play"" with his cup since we have not made it ""leak proof""  Out of curiosity I've tried our avent sippy with him again - and straight to chewing.  Handed him this cup - drank it up.  Silly boy.",4
The First Years - Lanolin Disposable Breast Pads 30 ct.,"For those early nursing days, these breast pads are a nice option.  The lanolin is built right into the pad.  I found them to be too bulky.  The added pressure of the extra bulk made them a little uncomfortable for me.  The paper-like edges also had a tendancy to crease and poke me.I had much better success using Lansinoh products.  They make a special ultra-sensitive pad which Amazon doesn't sell.  Just put the Lansinoh lanolin cream directly on to the their pad.  I couldn't have continued breast-feeding without their products.",3
"Graco Affix Backless Youth Booster Seat with Latch System, Sailor","it does not latch in tight, one side is tighter than the other therefore it slides... i should have listened to the other reviews about this same issue",1

"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","My grandson got this as a hand me down, and now I buy it for every expectant mother I know. It was so easy for one person to bathe him. It was great in the sink, not too big or too small, and no slipping and sliding. We used it in the bath tub until he could sit up by himself, then we used it as a cushion that he could sit on in the bath. I am expecting another grand-daughter and am getting one for her!  If only they had these 30 years ago!",5
Sassy Grasp and Glow Developmental Teether Toy,"This colorful rattle, teether toy is great for teaching infants to focus, reach, and grasp as well play and teethe. The colors are attractive and it's a great starter toy to develop basic skills.",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I've been using this hands free bra for about a month and absolutely love it. From past reviews I was wondering how I was going to get the breastshields through and positioned correctly, but I found that if I put one side of the bra on over the first breastshield, then put the other shield on and zip it up over the top, it works perfectly! Has given me a lot of freedom and made pumping much better. Also, being able to custom fit the bra and use the straps makes it very comfortable. Very happy with this purchase!",5
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,"You get what you pay for- this changing pad is not a luxury changing pad in the world of changing pads.  If there is such a thing.  The cover does seem cheap and like it would rip over time.  I highly recommend purchasing a removable washable cloth cover if you buy this pad.  It serves its purpose though, and I'd buy it again.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",We bought the Cloud B Twilight Constellation Night Light for my 1 year old daughter. She loved it. I think it is a great product and I would highly recommend it to anyone that has a young child.,5
"Motorola Additional Camera for Motorola MBP36 Baby Monitor, Brown with White","I have 2 cameras so I can monitor both of my children's rooms.  It toggles back and forth every 10 seconds or so and works great.  The additional camera's motor starting malfunctioning after a couple of months, so I called motorola, and they sent me out a replacement right away as well as a shipping label to return the old one.  Couldn't have been easier!  VERY happy with the purchase.  I recommend it especially if you're looking at trying to keep on eye on two or more kids (can add up to 4 cameras!)",5
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,We're practicing EC with our little guy and I've used this seat with the liners in them every time we need to get out and run errands. It's wonderful!,5
Ocean Wonders Sea Life Single Toggle Wall Plate Cover,I purchased the plate cover to go with my Ocean Wonders theme nursery and they went perfectly! I love them!!,5
"Baby's My First ABC Cloth Book - Black, White &amp; Red","This book is adorable and research shows a newborn/baby would be interested in it.  However my child is now nearing four months and has yet to pay attention to this book.Not only that, but when I washed it (as this will eventually end up in my child's mouth) the book lost so much color it looks faded and worn.  It looks as though it had been washed about 8x already.Save your money and buy a book that has a large 'crinkly' page in it.  Kids really eat that up and they will develop their hearing as well as visual/coordination skills. My suggestion isSesame Street Teething Book.  This way, they will also have it for the teething stage!I really wanted this book to work.  Unfortunately, not worth the $10.",1
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"I borrowed this bouncer from a friend and LOVED it.  My baby slept in it for the first 3 mo. It contoured her body and kept her flailing limbs still.  During the day she loved the play bar attachment and I loved that it was more interactive than other bouncers I had seen.Eventually, the left kick pad wore out and I bought the new model Kick and Play to replace it.  I love that the sound and lights respond to both kicks and batting of the hanging toys.  HOWEVER, this new model is a lot more upright than the old one.  My baby is 3 mo. old, but always ends up slumped toward the edge of the seat for a place to rest her head.  It would be totally unsuitable for a newborn.  I wish they still made the original Kick and Play.  Unfortunately, this one is going back to the store :(",2
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow","We cosleep and there's nothing worse than having to change sheets in the middle of the night when theres a pee leak.  I like having this under baby's bottom because if her diaper leaks, it works great to absorb the mess, and it goes right in the wash.  We have three of them we rotate through as needed, and an extra in the diaper bag.",4
"JJ Cole Mode Diaper Tote Bag, Cocoa Tree","I ordered this bag because I wanted one that was a little more girly and better suited to shopping.  I can use this one as a purse as well.  I started out with the ""back pack"" diaper bag, but found it difficult to quickly access items.  The material on this bag isn't the highest quality, but I love the design.  I can fit several items inside, but the outside pockets tend to unsnap if the pockets have only a few items.  The snaps are the magnetic type.  It is lightweight and not too huge.  The one thing that confused me is that it does include a changing pad.  I didn't know it did so we ordered the accessories set as well.  The down side to that was that the dark color on them was brown?!  I don't use it, but keep it as a back up.  Overall I would recommend the bag, as long as you get it on sale.  Choose one of the patterns that are cheaper.  I wouldn't pay $70 for it.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"The appearance and size are nice, but these bottles cost too much to have them leaking all over you when you are trying to feed your baby. They are not worth the money because they leak way too much.",1
"Kokopax Eco Classic Carrier, Pax","Bought one of the last available of these carriers, convinced by the 3 pound weight, which seems to be lighter than any other competing product on the market, and also because it sounds like the cloth is just plain old cotton, not some chemical-laden fabric (certainly the smell is not too bad). After some Google research I realized this product may not be available any longer, but I hope the decision is made to continue making these, or something based on these.The harness really is best put on from behind (thanks, fellow reviewers). So far occupant hasn't figured out how to get out of it, unlike a case mentioned in a previous review, but I can see how it would be possible.Adults of very different builds were able to put it on reasonably comfortably for short periods of time.",5
Seventh Generation Chlorine Free Baby Wipes Refill 350ct.,"I am not a mom, and I actually use these to clean my face. I also bring some with me traveling or on my bike commute to work everyday. You cannot beat Amazon Subscribe & Save for things like this! I use it to stock up on staples like these face wipes, save $$, and don't have to go deal with crowds of people shopping! I am a fan of most 7th Generation products, and these wipes are biodegradable, which is a plus.",5
"Skip Hop Grab &amp; Go Stroller Organizer, Platinum","does what you need-holds as many drinks as you and your baby need for a stroll-two lattes and a zippy and milk bottle fit with room for the requisite napkins, bib, house keys-the zippy-wallet thing is indispensable and can fit my mobile, keys, credit cards all with room to spare-zippy-wallet zipper works like butter",5
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,It's a teether. It's got nice colors and a good changeable shape. As far as teethers go I would rate it highly. But it's still a teether.,3
"LA Baby Commercial Grade 30.5&quot; X 43.5&quot; Playard, Royal Blue",We have been using this CribYard by L.A. Baby in our home for many months and think that it is a good product!It is very easy to set up and later fold for storage.  It is very stable and seems stronger than other play yards.,5
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","This crib bumper is one-of-a-kind and well constructed, however, despite the company's statements that the bumper fits all cribs, it does not fit the oeuf classic crib. I stretched, triple checked the instructions, and try as I might, I could not get it to fit. I ended up just leaving the end corner open by modifying the instructions to wrap one end around the corner post. I still use it, since there is no other product designed to keep arms and legs in that I feel safe using.",4
"Leachco Snoogle Mini Compact Side Sleeper, Sage/White dot",This pillow helps out so much with comfort at night. I wish it were about 2 inches longer but all in all it was a great buy!,4
Maclaren Juicy Couture Junior Techno,"My two year daughter jazmine loves it! I am very into fashion and I love juicy, so much that it's my daughter nickname. And if my daughter is going to play she is going to play in style! Lol very fun and durable. a must have of all the baby juicy divas.",5
"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light Fitted Sheet, Natural White","Yes, this sheet is expensive but in this case - you get what you pay for.  It is a soft, organic material that fits the mattress perfectly.  Other reviews have suggested getting any cheap crib sheet and folding under the excess material but I wouldn't do that.  Our baby is very active when he is sleeping and rolls his way around the crib throughout the night. I wouldn't be able to sleep if I was worried about the extra sheet material as a suffocation hazzard.  We only use our travel crib once or twice per month, so it was worth the extra money to get this high quality sheet that fits properly.",5
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe WrapSack Blanket, Sunny Bee, Small","So, our child is not really into being swaddled. I tried a range of ways to get him to like it and he doesn't. That said, it is still helpful as a wearable blanket for him on chilly nights.I should note that I did swaddle him quite a few times and this makes it very easy to do, even for people that I think may not be completely used to being around babies.I very much appreciated that the material is not too heavy so baby is not sweating. It seems the right weight to keep baby snug and warm, but not risk overly hot.The zipper at the bottom is very helpful so that diaper changes can happen without taking baby completely out of everything.I think this print is great and a nice gender neutral option.I would buy one as a gift for a friend!",5
"Buggy Bagg Elite Shopping Cart Cover, Groovy",Really good quality.  Quick and easy to use.  Worth the money spent.  A few more patterns to choose from would have been nice.,5
"Bummis Fabulous Wet Diaper Bag, Green, Small","We have a large wet bag to be used in a pail and 2 small wet bags just large enough to store 4 diapers each for a quick outing. This Bummis bag is a good size for a full day outing/day trip or at day care. It is large enough to store 6-7 diapers. I particularly like it because it can be hung on the door knob. With the other wet bags that we have, we have to zip them up and leave them on the floor. There is nothing wrong with it other than it looks a little untidy. The Bummis wet bag works well so far. We have washed it plenty of times with our cloth diapers and it is very durable. It does everything a wet bag needs to be: sealing up the smell and the wetness of the cloth diapers. We are planning to get a couple more of these.",4

Baby Trend Triplet Stroller in Silver and Black,"I bought this stroller for my 3 daughters, ages 1, 3 and 4.  It works great!  The only thing is the middle seat is kinda small, so when the baby gets bigger we will see how that works out.  My 4 year old fits in it but it is uncomfortable for her.  The back seat has lots of room and all the seats recline.  The only bad thing is because it is so big, it is kind of hard to fit in my car.  But then again, it's designed to carry 3 kids!  Life saver for a single dad.",5

"dexbaby Safe Sleeper Convertible Crib Bed Rail, White",It was the only toddler bed guard rail we could find that claimed to adapt to any converted crib. It was easy to install and works great to keep our toddler safe in her bed.,5
"Boba 3G Baby Carrier, Montenegro Black","I was lucky enough to discover a place where you can rent a baby carrier before purchase. I did a trial with the Boba 3G, Ergo Classic, and Ergo Sport. Before the trial, I was pretty certain that I would LOVE the Ergo Sport because that specific model had a vent, detachable hood, and 3 carry positions (back, hip, and front). Well, I found the hip carry to be completely useless. It became very uncomfortable after a few minutes. I didn't like the way the strap sat on my shoulder and rubbed against my neck in that position. Also, the vent made little difference when it came to keeping the baby cool. The Ergo Classic had super soft fabric (definitely a plus) but I didn't like the hood (which is not detachable). Also the seat was a little shallow for my baby who is shaped like the cutest string bean ever.NOW THE BOBA. I LOVE that it was so easy to put on. The Boba fit me and my husband perfectly. My husband is 6' 4"" and slender and I am 5' 7"" and voluptuous (my way of saying that I still have baby weight to lose). We were both very comfortable wearing it. The carrier distributes weight very evenly and I didn't experience any back pain. I also like the way the top strap adjusts-- it easily slides up and down but is secure.  I love that it has an adjustable hood. Also, the Boba has a higher panel (deep seat), so I felt that my baby was better supported in it. I think the Boba will better accommodate her as she grows. Lastly, for the next baby, I can use the Boba without an insert (unlike the Ergo).The only minus-- I liked the fabric on the Ergo better BUT the Boba is constructed from very durable fabric and felt high quality.Overall, it's a great carrier.",5
"Summer Infant Pacifier Thermometer, Teal/White",Bought for daugter to carry in her diaper bag.,5
"NoJo Little Bedding 2 Count Crib Sheet Set, Jungle Dreams",Can't beat these sheets for the price. They're soft & fit the standard crib mattress. I would order them again.,5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Pacific","Softer than the baby bjorn. I prefer the moby. My husband didn't. He preferred the ease and speed of a pre-formed carrier. The moby does take a bit of time to get on. Still, worked well for when I needed both hands for house cleaning.",3
Philips Avent Double Electric Comfort Breast Pump,"Initially, when I purchased this item, I was uncertain of how often I'd use it, or if I even needed a double breast pump. I was also concerned about how it would feel and work. Now, I can't imagine having a breast milk fed baby without it. I use it at least once a day, more if I'm working (I work part time). The compact design does make it easy to tote around and store. There's ample space in the travel bag for the pump itself, plus a few extra bottles, rags and sanitizing wipes. The double feature allows me to express milk very quickly and efficiently. It makes some noise, but not enough to disrupt my family in the middle of the night. It's very easy to disassemble and clean, then reassemble. While it does feel different, if you have it situated correctly, which can take a try or 2, it's relatively comfortable. You can sit back or straight up as described, but I find it more comfortable to lean forward just a bit (which is my natural sitting position). I haven't noticed the massage cushions having any positive effect, but there's no negative effect either. If needed, you can remove one tube or the other to make it a single breast pump.Since I initially wrote the review, pumping has increased to 6-8 times per day. Not sure if it was the increase in use or manufacturing defect, but the motor is dying already (barely 4 months into using the pump). Trying several outlets, the motor would stop and prompt a reset. A few times the unit outright refused to kick back on. Eventually it just stop turning on altogether. Philip's was somewhat helpful in getting a replacement. If I weren't so committed to giving my little one breast milk, this most definitely would have derailed pumping/breastfeeding. It has been quite an ordeal. The rep I first spoke with told me a new unit would be express shipped to me. I didn't receive the new unit for nearly a week (called on a Tuesday, received the new one on Saturday), then it was the wrong pump. At this point, I had to go out and purchase one to use in the interim. The second rep I spoke couldn't tell me why a different pump was sent, but they would one day ship the correct replacement. I recommend calling Philip's if you have any type of power disruption while pumping that is not occurring due to an outlet - it seems ""express shipping"" means something different to Philip's than it does the average person.Also, as soon as you get this unit, write the serial number on your user's manual. The serial number is actually on the bottom of the bottles, instead of on the unit. I was unaware of this and the 2 bottles I received with the pump were mixed in with the several others I purchased separately.",5
"Munchkin Deluxe Bottle Brush, Colors May Vary","When my mom bought this it looked really great and sturdy, which it is. The smaller brush is great and I still use it, but the larger one worked great for the first month maybe...then the bristles got scrunched up and wouldnt clean the corners at the bottom of the bottles, leaving the white residue. So I bout a new brush. I still use it to clean the tops of the bottles though. It is a very sturdy choice though, my new brush already broke :-)",3
"UPPAbaby G-Lite Stroller, Red Denny","This is by far the BEST fold up stroller ever. I bought this before moving overseas when I knew a lot of travel and enduring numerous airports was going to be in store for us and I took this thing all around the world and it was light weight, held up fantastic, and even the green color wasn't bad as I couldn't miss it.",5
"Summer Infant Lil' Loo Potty, Pink","My daughter hates sitting on this chair.  Im a mom of 4 and I decided this time,  instead of buying a more expensive potty chair...id buy this one,  thinking it didn't matter because it would still be comfy.  Well wrong move on my part.  She won't sit on it for too long. She has marks on her legs when getting up from it. Glad that I didn't waste a lot of money on this.  Will buy a different one for her.",3

Samsung SEW-3036WN Wireless Video Baby Monitor IR Night Vision Zoom 3.5 inch,"SEW-3036 is a beautiful monitor! Best I&#8217;ve seen! I&#8217;m having so much fun with this monitor. I love the simple look, nothing to bright and tacky&#8230; but still very warm and subtle. It&#8217;s a great looking monitor and camera. I also love the two-way-talk feature. It&#8217;s a lot of fun and it&#8217;s great that I can adjust the volume on the camera itself from my parent unit. &#8232;&#8232;The resolution is great and the audio is also really clear. They say it will go up to 800ft in open space, I don&#8217;t think I wanna bother testing that out but I haven&#8217;t had any issues with the range. It&#8217;s really a beautiful monitor. It has a lot of helpful features. It hasn&#8217;t failed me yet. And, it&#8217;s at a reasonable price! I love it!",5
BubbleBum Inflatable Car Booster Seat,"Fits snugly between our Britax Triumph 85 and Graco Turbo Booster.  Perfect for carpooling in our 2006 Ford Escape.  We also use it to get another adult in the backseat with my toddler still in his Britax.  My 5 year old says it is fun and while I won't use it for a long-distance trip, it is definitely great at putting the seatbelt in the right place!",5
Baby's Cozy World Microfiber Embroidered Cover Warm Grey,I searched for many hours to find a car seat cover that only goes over the carseat and not between the baby and the straps.  This is a safety hazard as carseats are not designed to have plushy fabrics between baby's back and the seat or the straps.  This may cause them to fail in an accident.  This cover is thick and cozy.  The embroidered design is fun and matches our Chicco Miro car seat.  Very happy with this purchase.,5
Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature First Sips Weaning Cup - 4m - 5 Oz. (Pink),"It doesn't leak, but my daughter initally had problems using it. She just chewed on it instead of sucking. After using a couple other cups (that leaked EVERYWHERE) she realized what she was supposed to do with it, and then it was wonderful!Also, like the other reviews say, it is only $5 in the store, but if you're like me, and don't have the time to go to Babies R Us - or don't have one near, the $16 is worth it. Just being honest... I'm posting a photo of my daughter using it.",4
6 Pack FuzziBunz Perfect Fit Cloth Diaper-Girls Sz Large,"I love the colors, soft fleece and the absorbancy. My only complaint is that the large seems SO much larger than the mediums. We have some mediums which still fit my 20 month old dd, but they are getting quite snug. The larges are swimming on her. We use these and they are fine, it will just be quite a while  before these fit her well. For now we use them with dresses because they are so bulky under pants.",4
"John Deere Pickles 21X42&quot; John Deer Nap Mat, Down On The Farm",This is a great napper for my son to use at his daycare.  It not too thick and not too thin.  My son loves the color and john deere print.  It rolls up very easily and washes very easily.,5
Munchkin Five Sea Squirts,"The Munchkin Sea Squirts have become our son's favourite bath toy, but not without a hiccup or two.We first introduced him to the squirts when he was about 4 months old, and they actually frightened him. These toys hold quite a lot of water, and they pack quite a punch when you squirt them! He was really quite upset by how powerful the jet of water was, so I'd recommend caution when considering using these with really young babies.Now baby is in his 7th month, and becoming used to all sorts of new things, and he's quickly had a change of heart about these toys. They're small enough for him to hold, soft enough for him to manipulate them himself, and he really enjoys having the water squirted all about. There's not much doubt about what his favourite toy is now!So I'd definitely recommend these Sea Squirts for bath time fun, especially for older babies and toddlers. But they may take some getting used to for younger bubs, so use caution if your young one is under six months.",4
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Changing Pad Cover, Liam The Brave - Medallions",Baby hasn't come yet so I can't talk about the functionality of this but it fits our Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad well and has slots for the buckle.

"DaVinci Jayden 4 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Ebony",I thought that this crib was going to be cheap and hard to put together because of how affordable it was.  I'm glad I was wrong. I was able to put this crib together in less than an hour. It is rock solid and is one of the very few cribs you can find in black (not dark brown).,5
Gund Huggybuddy- 18 inch,"This was much smaller than I was expecting it to be and it was all head in the package.  But when it opens, the animal is empty, kind of, but it has that really silky soft satiny fabric on the inside, the kind that babies love being touched on the face with.  It is super satiny and soft.  It is something that a little baby will be able to hold on to.It is wonderful and will definitely be my first choice for all future babies in my family.",5
"Playtex 2 Pack BPA Free VentAire Silicone Nipples, Medium Flow",I was looking for medium flow of this particular style of  Vent Aire nipple.  They must not make them anymore as this was the only place I could find them.  I am very happy with them though.,5
Boppy Luxe - Clouds,"For all of the positive reviews on this, I didn't find the Boppy all that great. It didn't support my arms as I held my baby and it was more cumbersome than anything when I was trying to feed him. I don't think I would suggest this to other moms, regular pillows you'd find on your couch or bed are easier to get in place than this thing. About all I'll use it for in the future with other children is for the baby to lie in when they're between 0-3 months in age. The Boppy with toys that hang over it might be a good purchase, but this thing does not work well for breastfeeding.",2

Very cute and fun for the kids to look at.",5
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Percale Portable/Mini Crib Bumper, White",OK first off the bad review above mine she obviously didnt read Mini/portable crib.  This bumper is for a prtable crib with measurements of 40 x 26 x 38 so of course it wouldnt fit a full size crib. So dont get leary if you want this for a mini crib :),3

Wonderworld Peek-a-boo Ball,"Yes I was also one of those bone heads who didn't read the dimensions and was expecting a much larger ball. We bought this a s a first christmas present for our son and din't open the fedex box untill christmas. We were as shocked as he was(what? we paid $10+ for this bitty little ball?). However this ball is like baby crack! It was by far our sons favorite toy out of everything!! We took it on our next playdate and every single baby wanted this thing and they wanted those little pegs!!! It definetly helped encourage them to crawl, they would stop at nothing to get it!! LOVE LOVE just bite the bullet and don't tell your husband how much it was untill after your child falls in love with it.",5

Safety 1st Secure Mount Deadbolt Lock,My toddler learned how to unlock the apartment door- so I needed something fast that I could easily install and uninstall and something that would keep her in.This is perfect for my needs- she can't figure it out (she is 2) and I feel much better knowing that she can't sneak out without my knowledge.  It was a great price too!,5

Silly Billyz Bright Pink Play Blanket,This great blanket has been a life-saver.  It fits in my diaper bag without taking up too much room.  I've used it when changing diapers in restaurants (I'm a little insure about those yucky changing tables.) It's also great when we stop at a park and we want to sit on the grass.  I've washed it a ton of times and it still looks great.,5
Adjustable Reusable Washable One Size Baby Cloth Diaper Diapers Nappy 1 Diaper + 2 Inserts Yellow,"The diapers look nice, but they are lined with a very cheap fleece and the inserts are thinner than all my other inserts. I hven't used them because I'm contemplating returning them.",2

The bag gets misshapen and bulky:o[ The back pack concept is net but, again once you put baby iteams inside it gets to bulky on your back;o( I would say to only buy this bag if you aren't going very far and don't plan to put much inside it. I'm sad because it is a cute bag.",3
Maxi-Cosi Pria 70 with Tiny Fit Convertible Car Seat,"This seat is a bit complex to set up initially, and the instructions must be followed carefully to make sure you are using the seat correctly. The cover on the Pria is very soft and cushy, and feels like it would be very comfy.The Pria has 3 recline positions:- Position 1 is the most upright of the positions and can only be used when the seat is forward facing and the child is between 40 and 70 pounds.- Position 2 is the middle, slightly reclined position. Position 2 can be used both rear facing and forward facing. Position 2 must be used forward facing if the child is under 40 pounds.- Position 3 is the most reclined position and is used rear facing only. This is the position used for infants and newborns.I was interested in the seat because it replaced the Maxi-Cosi Priori and it supposedly fits well in smaller vehicles because it has an internal recline so the seat does not take up as much room.I went to my local baby store to try the Maxi-Cosi Pria in my MINI Cooper. For anyone not familiar, this is a tiny car with a tiny backseat. The older Maxi-Cosi Priori was a seat that had good reviews for fitting in a MINI Cooper, so I was hopeful that the Pria would work too.... This was not the case. The seat would fit fine if it was forward facing in Position 1 (it would take up a lot of space, but would definitely fit). There is no way it would fit forward facing in Position 2 (the position necessary for children under 40 pounds) because the Pria would hang off the seat and the front seat of the car would be totally unusable. The Pria fit (it was a tight fit) in Position 2 rear-facing, but the front seat would still have to be pushed up significantly. There is no way the Pria would fit rear facing in Position 3. The seat is just reclined so far and takes up way too much space.Overall, this is a BIG and HEAVY seat (over 20 pounds) but would really only work for a newborn to 70 pound child if it was used in a sedan, van, or large SUV. I think this is the case with most convertibles with high weight limits. I understand the desire to keep kids rear facing for longer, so the seats need to be bigger, bit it makes it very difficult to find convertible car seats that work with smaller cars.Ultimately, after deciding that there was absolutely no way the Pria would work for the MINI, I decided to buy the Combi Coccoro (sight unseen) from Amazon. The Coccoro has a weight limit of 40 pounds, but is a much better fit (rear and forward facing) in the MINI Cooper.",3

Fisher-Price Coco Sorbet Soothing Motions Glider,"It was a shower gift, everyone liked it, wanted to know where I got it. It had soft colors and I know the baby well like it.",5
Safety 1st 2 Pack Custom Fit All Purpose Strap,"As Baby gets more and more wily, I've had to up my babyproofing game.  Enter these straps.  I love that these are flexible enough that I have mounted them in very different configurations on very different furniture pieces, and they've held reliably in all cases.  Should they ever fail, I'll be back to update this review, but till then, good luck defeating your own wily children.Three sidenotes:- The default image for this item makes it look fairly small and inconspicuous, but it's actually pretty big:  The white end pieces are almost 2"" x 1.5"", so ""inconspicuous"" isn't really the word for them.  But who has time to worry about decor with small persons underfoot?  Just thought I would mention it because I was a little surprised when I opened the package.- The strap is graduated so you can select the length that works best for your need.  Again, nice flexibility for different uses.  However, once you've settled on your length and clamp the fixed end shut, then you can no longer alter the length.  Given that the entire system isn't built for re-use, that's probably to be expected, but I do intend to try with double-sided stick-em if I ever have another child; at best, all I'll be able to do is re-adhere the end pieces as they are, because I won't be able to adjust the length.  Again, just a thought.- The directions tell you to allow 24 hours between placing the end pieces and using the strap.  I recommend following that advice to ensure your adhesive bonds as strongly as possible and your straps work properly.",5

Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"AMAZING swing.  My daughter has reflux and cannot lie down to sleep, so she naps in this swing all day...I'd use it at night also if it weren't too big to haul up my stairs. The recline is perfect and the music is beautiful--much more pleasant and Zen than most other products (no creepy kiddie singing!!).  Only drawback is that the slowest speed is way too fast for my preemie...but she's almost 8 lb.s now and I think in a few weeks she'll be able to hang with the first speed.  Also, the motor is sort of noisy, but I'm not giving this swing 4/5 stars for either reason, since I honestly don't know what I would do without this swing. A MUST HAVE for new parents.",5

Whether its hide and seek or tag (you're it), the laughter just keeps pouring out. I recommend this to everyone with small children. FYI: it does have 1 safety issue with the roll over.

I have other family member who have the same complaint about them.  Seriously think about another bottle when purchasing!",1
[Award Winning] Kidsme Food Feeder (Large size),I just got this and put it right to use. After giving it a good washing I placed a small piece of pear in it. My daughter (7months) was really happy to sit and chew the pear through the little holes. I didn't have to worry about her choking or watch her like a hawk (as she has no teeth as of yet).

Britax Infant Car Seat Sun and Bug Cover,"So it's warming up outside so it's great to have a cover to keep out the insects & doubly nice that it provides UV protection, but my primary reason for purchasing this---& using it every day even when it's cloudy--- is to keep people at a safe distance from my baby.  Everyone loves babies, duh, they're adorable (especially mine, lol), but so many people lose all sense when it comes to wanting to see & touch them that they spread their germs all over your newborn!The product does exactly as it says & is pictured... true it doesn't come with instructions on how to put it on, but it's really not that difficult to figure out & YES, the gray UV cover does fold down so that you can keep the sun out of your baby's little eyeballs.I like it a lot, use it for every stroller ride!",5
"Vital Baby Baby's 1st Feeding Set, Pink",Great product all around!

Beachfront Baby Water Wrap Baby Carrier - Lime Green,"I was searching for a cooler way to wear my son in our crazy Texas weather, so hot!! I was loving my Ergo carrier and Boba wrap but they were just too hot to wear in June here! I purchased a ring sling, quite nice and this Beachfront Baby water wrap in Caribbean Blue, so pretty! We took our son for the first time to the pool on Father's Day, and my hubby wore him. We were careful to read and follow the instructions and do a pocket cross carry, which ensures the material stays in place and is much safer. It was perfect. Very comfy for dad and baby and they were both happy. It was nice to not have to be confined to the baby pool, and yet feel confident and secure enough to have a good hold on our wiggly slippery baby, and get in the grown up pool. We have also used for showers, so nice to be able to actually take one, and for everyday use at home and running errands! Couldn't be more perfect for the weather out here. Even a new baby wearer can get this! I did! It's easy to learn how to use after a few times, especially with the great instructions provided, and so comfy and multi-purposed. You can't beat the price either IMO. Plus I learned that work at home moms make these and is sold locally in my city, wow, impressed! Excellent wrap, would recommend highly to anyone! I'm 5'3"" and 150# and my hubby is 5'8"" and 180# and the regular size worked fine for both of us. But they do sell petite and XL too, however, if you contact the seller, they'll work with you if you need some help with anything. Anyhow, don't hesitate on this wrap, it's wonderful!",5

"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large","I'm reviewing this just for those of you who might be confused by the large vs. small models. My 2 year old son is pretty small for his age - maybe 25 pounds, maybe 34 inches. He's tiny. So when I saw that the ""large"" wheely bug is supposedly for 3 years old and up I figured my tiny guy would certainly need the small. Still, I hated to buy the wrong size and then have to ship it back. So I found a store in town that offers wheely bugs and went there to physically have my son try them out. Am I glad I did! The small is so tiny that I cannot imagine it being appropriate for any child. If your child is so small as to need the small version, chances are he or she should not be riding it. Remember, these things do not have seat belts or other safety features. It's a fast-moving ride-on, on chair casters. The small model looks suitable for a stuffed doll, perhaps. My son fits on the large version with no problem. His feet hit the floor flat. He can climb on and off with no difficulty. Also, be aware that this really only rolls well on hardwood floors or other smooth, flat surfaces. It's tough to roll on carpet of any sort - even area rugs. Would work well on a smooth, flat driveway or in an unfinished basement. So please do not hesitate to purchase the large model, unless your child is very young or very, very tiny (maybe shouldn't be on this toy, in that case), and do be sure you have someplace where your child can have fun riding it.",5
"Sassy Baby Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary",The product works but it is not as pictured. I had specifically bought this brand because it is the same as one I had bought for my older son. The tab to open it is not as pictured and makes it difficult to use. I thought I made the mistake and didn't really it was their mistake until I already opened and used it. So beware!!,1

Yoomi 8oz Baby Bottle + **BONUS** Tooth Tissues Sample!,"I got 2 the bottles and 1 warmer and the Warner was leaking blue solution. I contacted the seller and had NO problems getting a new one.the seller shipped FAST both times. This bottle works as described and warms the feed to the perfect temperature. It's easy to assemble but a little time consuming to charge if u don't have a microwave pod; I can't find one anywhere. The down side is u only get one use until u recharge it again and who says you'll be somewhere to warm it on a stove top when ur not at home; you also only get 150 uses b4 u have to buy another and I feel it should have more uses. Also, the warmer is heavy so the bottle sux when it's in there LOL. But I will say that it's a very good product and anyone should purchase at least once.",4
Kidco Universial Outlet Cover 4-pack,"I purchase these (despite the cost) for every exposed outlet in my home. To me they are a ""no-brainer"" in childproofing.

Bob Single Stroller Travel Bag Black,"I was hesitant to spend the money on this to take our Bob Revolution to Disney World. In the end I bought it figuring I would sell it to somebody after the trip. My reasoning for finally giving in was the fact that my previous jogging stroller (not a Bob) was destroyed after flying with it on a previous Disney trip.Bottom line: this thing is virtually bomb proof. While taking the stroller apart is not a blast and takes a little bit of time, it fits very well and very securely. We ended up packing it ahead of time and checking it. Something that made me second guess the security of my precious stroller. I literally watched with my 2year old as they &#34;tossed&#34; the stroller onto the conveyor when loading our luggage on the plane.When we got to Disney my stroller was unscathed. Even the bag was unscathed. Like I said... Virtually bomb proof.Worth it if you take great care of your stroller like I do. Buy it! You won't regret the decision!",5

DadGear Backpack Hawaiin Blue,"We purchased this bag for our Disney trip, and it worked great!  With 3 small children (11 month old twins and a 2 yr old) I will not go back to using my regular diaper bag.  I loved the bottle pockets on each side and the easy access to the wipes and diapers.  The backpack was easy to carry, though we also hung it on our stroller quite a bit.  Plenty of pockets for storage, and a large main compartment with zippers that go all the way down the sides for easy access.  We were able to pack an entire day's worth of formula, bottles, diapers, wipes, snacks, clothes and toys in the bag for the drive to and from Disney.  I would absolutely recommend this bag to parents of multiple children.***Product update**  We've had this product for 6 years and 4 kids total.  Still our go to bag for our all day outings to Disney, plane ride, or the Amusement park.  I'd buy this again and recommend it to anyone looking for a bag that can carry it all.",5

"Babymel Ruby Rucksak Diaper Bag, Mocha","I love love love this bag. Isn't ridiculous with the pockets (i get disorganized with too many pockets. I start shoving things in randomly and then can't find anything. I'm much better at making a system with a smaller number of pockets) - there are four internal gathered pockets and two external zip pockets. The external zip pockets are great for slipping in your cell phone or baby's pacifier or other small items you want on hand. There's also one more internal zip pocket, which I might starry using for her change of clothes, but we'll see.Exterior is nice looking and subtle. As much as I admire some of the whimsical and fun picklebottom and jujube patterns, a lot of them scream diaper bag (admittedly, many of theirs don't, but none of them had this rucksack kind of look). It really reminds me of a bag I loved in college, so maybe this has a nostalgia factor me as well. If it holds up through the diaper bag years, I can see myself converting this to a casual on the go bag.This is perfect size for me. It's dimensions are bigger than the Brighton backpack I was using based on online published measurements for both, but feels smaller in that I don't feel like I'm carrying around a giant picnic basket on my back like I did. The interior seems similar size but my perception may be different than others, ymmv. Same goes for the picklebottom boxy I was going to get before I saw this- with its soft sides, it seems more usable for me than the rectangular interior of the boxy- again, your mileage may vary, some people might prefer that interior.I could see this being a ""dig around to find the lost item"" sometimes, but so are most of the diaper bags I've looked at if you're not careful- just because of its wide mouth and soft structure. I like having it wide open like this so I can use a diaper clutch for the essentials, then my wallet, a small laundry bag with a couple onesies in it, and a few burp cloths or swaddling blanket, and the pockets for items like bottles and such. It does have a lighter colored interior so should be able to see things in contrast, though.  The included changing pad folds nicely to cit into one of the gathered pockets. Haven't used the included insulated bottle bag yet, so don't know how long its good to use yet.Have already used this bag a couple times and liked the backpack straps more in usage than I have with some other backpack diaper bags. These don't cut into my shoulders as much as they did (what is it with diaper bag backpacks having narrow, seatbelt-like material? So uncomfortable!). These are padded faux leather. You can also strap them down and away with velcro when using the messenger bag style strap. That strap has been useful with its provided velcro stroller straps, but I use the backpack option more, so I just use my jj cole stroller straps on the hooks instead.Will try to add more thoughts as time goes by and good/bad experiences happen",4
Jolly Jumper Stroller Caddy - Stroller Handlebar Organizer,"I got this for my Uppababy Vista and I love it! Way better than the Uppababy one. I love that it has a large zipper compartment in the middle (can hold snacks, pacifier, wipes, its a pretty big spot) and it has two organizer slits on the outside where you can keep keys, phone, a small wallet. Such a bonus for just a cup holder. There is a big Jolly Jumper embroidered logo on the middle part, but it is in dark grey so it isn't that bad.The cup holders are great. They are really long so you can put in a tall skinny water bottle (like a smart water or those long ones from Starbucks). And the cupholders are big enough to put two Venti iced cups from Starbucks in there no problem. It does fit a tall iced cup in there too because it is wide enough. Even though the Uppababy handles are slanted, because this thing has 4 adjustable straps you can EASILY make it lay straight. Put some drinks in there and adjust it until it is straight and it is PERFECT!!! Love this thing... check out the first reviewer's video for more details, it is awesome.",5

"Baby Trend Expedition LX Travel System, Millennium","I just dropped this thing off at a second-hands-goods store (for babies) and I was glad, glad, glad to get rid of this thing. I bought this hoping for an everyday, go-to stroller. This is NOT that stroller.Concerning the Stroller:Pros:- Thanks to the inflatable tires, the ride can be very smooth.- Three-wheeled design turns on dime; this is a very nimble stroller.- Never had a problem turning: turns were very reliable and always smooth.- Front wheel can be locked into forward-only position.- Cup Holders and Parent's console rock.- Comfortable Handlebars: easy to hold and steer with one hand.- With the exception of the rocking issue (see cons below) this feels ""moderately well built:"" Ok, perhaps decent, but not great. Some parts of the frame felt dead on, but many of the materials and secondary components feel like below average or off-the-shelf materials (excepting the frame it feels like it could have been put together with odd parts you might find at a Walmart).- Ample storage with adequate (not excellent) access.Cons- Heavy- Cumbersome- Two handed folding operation is mandatory: no way is this one-handed folding.- And you'll definitely need both hands to pull this out of your trunk.- When the seat is attached to the stroller it becomes unstable (the entire assembly: baby seat and stroller rocks quickly back and forth, left to right, in direct proportion to the speed I'm walking at). This would happen when I was walking quickly so I never even bothered trying to jog with it. I check the pressure of the tires, the bearings in the hubs of the wheels, etc. but couldn't find the problem. With the baby seat removed this problem is much less pronounced but was still present. Also, if the front tire was locked in 'forward only' position the rocking was much less pronounced.- When this is sitting in my trunk, not only is it difficult to remove, but it seems to have some kind of dark magic that makes it more difficult to remove anything else that may also be in the trunk at the same time.- My wife scratched the bumper of my car trying to get this thing loaded.I think the reason this thing makes me so angry is because it really gets your hopes up. You want to like this thing.. it has some good points: turning and handling for instance are a couple of good points, but it just really fails (and in a way that just frustrates you completely) on every other point that matters.The baby Seat:Pros:- easy to attach/remove to the car seat base.- Handle design is convenient to hold.Cons:- Canopy broke off pretty easily / difficult to replace.And that's it... this thing is about as basic as you can get. Very, very very mediocre. Would not buy again.The Base Station: I bought two: one for both cars. Nothing remarkable.At the end of the day, these things worked, but I never, ever felt that any of these components made life easier. NOT IN THE LEAST.",2
Keekaroo Height Right High Chair With Comfort Cushion Set - Lime,"This chair is great.  Came packaged really well, easy to put together - Solid. So solid that I couldn't get the footrest in.  I takes some muscle and patience since after putting the thing together; once the things are tightened it's near impossible to put the footrest in.  I went back and loosened each side up but was somewhat reluctant to loosen then tighten the bolt for fear of stripping them - either way thru more use we are now able to get the footrest in.One other thing, the cushion on back works well.  So does the lap belt; however the lap belt used in conjunction with the bottom cushion doesn't work efficiently.  Even with the belt; when our son goes stiff like a board to try and get out - this action causes the cushion to slide forward and out of place - a minor hassle.",5
"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","I bought this crib after checking out ratings for non-drop side cribs on Consumer Reports website. This is a beautiful bed for the price. My husband was at work when the crib arrived, so I asked my dad to come over and help me assemble it. He is in his late 60's and the two of us had the bed together in less than 30 minutes.The directions are clear and easy to follow.The bed is sturdy, doesn't have casters on the bottom, but that's only a minor issue. I bought the cherry bed, and the color is so pretty. I love the modern look of the bed. You can see the screws, because this bed doesn't come with the  little circle thingies you can pop in to cover them. It doesn't really take away from the look of the bed, though,and will make it easier to disassemble when you convert it to a toddler bed later.I'm really happy with this purchase, and know I will be using this bed for years to come as a toddler bed, and later as a full-sized bed.",5
25 mm One-Piece Breastshield w/ Valve and Membrane for Medela Breast Pumps; Set of 2; Made by Maymom,"First of all, I just want to say, the product (Maymom made 21mm one-piece breastshield) is quality made, and I have been using it for the past three weeks.  No more pains! Ya. I expressed at least 1 oz more milk every session after I have used these 21 mm breastshields.  This one piece product works as well as the two piece Medela PersonalFit 21mm one.What I would like to share more is how I came to this product.  Like everyone else, I tried the 24 mm breastshield that came with the machine.  As a first-time mother, I thought having some pains after a pumping session is normal.  I was wrong.  After few days of using it, the pains were terrible.  I experienced a lot of pains and bruising from using the standard 24mm shields. From the diagrams on Medela's website and the information that comes with the pump, the flange should fit with just your nipple being pulled in during pumping. It is confusing if you have a mixed areola/nipple area.  The problem is that my 'areola' protrudes about 1/8 inches and I thought that is part of the 'nipple' area when I talked to a lactation consultant.  The lactation consultant told me to try larger breastshields.  I tried larger one (27 mm), though it did not hurt as much, my milk supply went down by one-third and the bruise area became large.  I felt every suction along the pumping.  I tried the next size up - 30 mm, even worse!After reading more and more reviews, I decided to try a smaller one.  I ordered both Medela's PersonalFit 21 mm breastshield and this Maymom made one (it is cheaper, and others said it is easier to clean). Tada.. No more pains.  Both brands worked well.  Finally a FIT.I realized now that when I was using the larger ones (27 mm and 30 mm), it was more of the 'areola' that was pulled into the tunnel and the milk ducts were blocked during a suction action.  Therefore, less milk supply.  When I was using the medium one, the sensitive area of my 'areola' was rubbing the tunnel, thus pains.So the bottom line - know what are the nipple and areola of your breasts.  It is the nipple part that should go into the breastshield tunnels, not the areola.  Choose the right size and pumping will no longer be painful!",5

Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I was really excited about this tub, thinking it would fullfil all of our needs- I was wrong! We tried using the tub sling in our sink when my son was about 4 weeks old. He would slide right off of it. It was more work having it in the sink than to just go without. Now as for the tub itself- I tried, my husband tried, as well as several other relatives, and if there is a way to use it without it leaking water....we couldn't figure it out!! Lastly, the amount of effort it took to pull the bath to full size, or to push it together for storage was more trouble than anyone would want to mess with. If you decide to give this tub a try, keep the box! We just ended up throwing ours away and buying a new tub.",1

Fisher-Price Sweet Treats Gift Set,"I got these to suppliment the toys to my daughter's activity mat to offer more variety in her play. These toys are great! They are super durable and are just as cute in person. The strawberry has a tiny rattle is perfect for teething because the chocolate part is a bit softer than the rest of the toy and the lolipop is a cute and simple rattle. The cupcake my daugher's favorite. It spins and has a cute chime to it and she loves to bat/swat at it.***I MUST NOTE THAT THE CUPCAKE IS HEAVY AND BEST PLAYED WITH AS A HANGING TOY. It's heavier than you would anticipate and smaller babies can easily bonk themselves with it if allowed to play with it on it's own. For the price of the set, this minor issue doesn't deserve to lose a star for it, mainly because these type of toys are used for a few months before most babies move on to more interactive toys to play with. As with all things, use your common sense with your baby and your child should be fine.I purchased this set when my daughter was 3 months old and at 7months, she still plays with it regularly. I highly recommend purchasing this set. It's the perfect addition to your child's activity mat(if you don't mind it not matching) and will offer your baby lots of stimulation for an affordable price.",5

Proudbody Basic Pregnancy Belly Cast Kit,"I just used this kit one week ago. My doula applied the balm and the strips while I sat in a chair. Here is my take on the experience:- The whole process took much longer than anticipated (about 40 minutes), and I was extremely uncomfortable by the end. I would recommend sitting in your most comfortable chair - I used a dining room chair with a pillow and the plastic sheet over the whole thing, but my back and butt were killing me by the end.- It can be very difficult to apply the casting material over hands. I used my right hand/arm to cover my breasts and my other arm to hold the bottom of my belly (so it wouldn't look weird having just one hand/arm). My fingers were spread wide as recommended so that my doula could get between them, but the gauze kept sticking to her gloves, so whenever she pressed the gauze in between my fingers, it would just stick to her finger and pop right out. It took a ton of patience and water, and the finished result isn't the greatest. There are areas between my fingers that do not look quite right, but I am afraid to sand them because the cast is quite thin, especially in that area. There is even an area by my hand that cracked while it was drying! I am really bummed about that, and I am not sure how to fix it.- Count on it being messy. The plaster drips, crumbles, and gets EVERYWHERE. It comes off with water, but it will take a good amount of scrubbing to remove from floors, the table, and your pants. If you feel comfortable, I would recommend wearing just panties. I wore sweat pants because I was afraid that I would get cold. I was never once cold, and I had to wash my sweat pants 3 times to get all of the plaster off of them. Also, the edges of the cast will crumble a little when you remove it from your body, leaving dust and chunks of plaster on the ground. It sweeps up pretty well. I've seen videos online where it looks like a very clean process (using other brands) - I'm not sure how that is possible. My doula has done this at least one dozen times, and it was messy. Maybe the other brands have kits that are less messy or something.- The cast looks cool, but it is super flimsy. We used all 4 of the rolls of belly casting material (cut into strips, of course), and casted from a couple inches below my shoulders to the the bottom of my baby bump. I have heard that it is a good idea to reinforce the cast by applying leftover strips to the inside of the cast, but we have none left over, and we have already spent a small fortune at the craft store and hardware store buying sanding screens, gesso, brushes, etc. It has dried for a week, and I am scared to sand it because it is so flimsy that I fear it will be easily ruined. If I had known this, I would have bought the deluxe kit so because it comes with an extra roll of the casting gauze, and some supplies to finish the cast with.- You must at least seal the cast. My cast is totally dry now, but the edges kind of crumble at the slightest touch. It is recommended that once the cast dries (24-48 hrs)you smooth it with a sanding screen, then seal the whole thing (inside and out) with gesso, otherwise it will continue to crumble and make a mess. After that, you can decorate the whole thing however you want, or leave it as is. This is time consuming, and for $10 more, I wish that I would have bought the deluxe kit since it has the sanding screen, brush, and gesso included. (I spent $30 buying these items separately, so I wish that I would have known I'd need these items in advance of purchasing the kit). I thought that the basic kit had all of the necessary items, but if you don't want the cast to fall apart, sealing the cast is very necessary.- Overall, if I had to do it again, I would get the deluxe kit or try another brand. This kit makes a flimsy cast, so unless you have the materials already, you will have to invest additional money into buying things to sand and seal everything - why not just pay $10 more and get the deluxe kit? I am due in 4 weeks, so my husband and I are debating whether we should attempt to sand, seal, and decorate the one that we have, or just start all over again. I have seen other brands online that have very thick strips, which might allow the process to go more quickly. I will post an update if we try it. I will also update regarding finishing this cast if we decide to do that instead.",3

Primo 4-In-1 Soft Seat Toilet Trainer and Step Stool White with Pastel Blue Seat,"I also bought this potty based on the high ratings. I figured 85% of 99 reviewers gave it 5 or 4 stars, so this must be the potty to buy and since I'm a first-time potty trainer, I'll rely on the reviews. I received this potty today, and am returning it tomorrow.The PROS:  The blue soft seat is comfortable, though it is pretty large for a two year old child, at around 10 inches in diameter. The handles are easy to grip, both by adults and little toddler hands. This potty is pretty light weight, which would make carrying it around easy, but it makes it less stable as I will explain below.The CONS: The lid falls down REALLY easily. If you just slightly nudge the potty, the lid will fall down. The lid also has a lip that hangs off of it and goes around it which has further plastic tabs that extend from it. Furthermore, these tabs have pointy parts that extend off of them (you can actually see these in the image). First, all these extensions from the lid seem like they will be a pain to clean, especially since it is suppose to be a splash guard for boys. But worse, if the lid falls on little body parts, it can be painful.The major con, though, is that there is absolutely NO GRIP on the bottom surface of this potty. If you want to know what the stability of this potty is like before buying it, just turn a plastic pail or bucket upside down and try to sit on it. The bottom of this potty is just a ring of thin plastic, like the top of a bucket, not even a full flat surface of plastic. If you plan on using this potty on a mat or rug, it will be good enough and probably won't slide, just as if you were to put that plastic bucket on a mat or rug. And because this potty is no heavier than a typical plastic pail, when a kid goes to sit on it on a smooth floor, it will move and slide around, and will most likely cause a toddler who has not yet developed perfect balance, to fall.This is what happened when my two year-old tried to sit on his new potty today. He was so excited to get his potty out of the box, and right after we placed it on the floor, he tried to sit on it. The potty slid out from under him and he fell. I think our potty training has been set back already, sigh.",2
Rare! John Lennon Real Love Baby Photo Journal - My Busy Days,I received this book as a gift for my daughter a year and 1/2 ago and I loved filling it out. It is cute and colorful. After a few months though I noticed a couple pages had fallen out. I just had my second daughter and now noticed this book is really falling apart. I bought a different one for our new baby - Beatrice Potter one...and love it...I am pretty disappointed because I took the time to add alot to this one as far as writing and photos etc. Plus how do I give this to my daughter later? page by page? I might just by another book and rewrite everything.,3
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"Don't buy this unit!  We purchased this unit because the professional product reviews were all positive.  We were concerned about the consumer reports of inadequate volume, but were comforted by one review that explained that the volume issue could be resolved if the sensitivity setting and volume setting were both set to maximum.  We have set both to maximum, but the volume is horrible.  An adult reading a story in the baby's room can barely be heard.  This is not what you want in a  baby monitor. You want to hear every breath, so that if the baby stops breathing, the ABSENCE of sound wakes YOU up.Clearly, the review outlining the remedy was written by a company representative.  We are disappointed that the professional, supposedly objective pundits got this review wrong.",1

"Graco Safe Seat Infant Car Seat, Quinn","THIS SEAT IS VERY NICE, I LIKE THE FACT THAT IT HAS AN INDICATOR SO THAT YOU CAN TELL IF IT IS INSTALLED PROPERLY. iT CAN GET BE HEAVY AS YOUR BABY GROWS BUT IT WORTH IT WHEN IT COMES TO SAFETY. I WOULD RECCOMMEND IT TO ANY MOM!",5
Metalica Pliko P3 MT Stroller,This is a great stroller I would give it 5 stars but it is missing a few things that would make it an absolute dream. Here is what I love:1)Unlike some other reviews I find it easy to fold and unfold. One handed? No. but easy to use.2)Small and compact when not in use. It fits in the back of my car and leaves lots of room for shopping bags etc.3)Great visor. I love that it can completely cover the baby. When my daughter was 6 weeks I was caught in a flash rainstorm with her in the mountains and I just pulled that down and the carseat carrier up and she stayed completely dry. It also is great to keep wind and sun out. I also love the little window so you can see in to see if they are sleeping etc.4)Easy secure in and out for the car seat latch system.5)Seems comfortable for her.6) Unlike some other reviews I find the storage bag to be plenty big.7) Easy to recline the seat8)Looks great. I have the red.Now the negatives (which are pretty minor overall)1) I find it a little difficult to steer. I am getting used to it but in the beginning I would be shopping and bump into racks etc.2)The drink holder could be bigger it doesnt hold a bottle of water or even a small drink. Plus it pops off half the time in the trunk and it is easy to misplace or forget to bring with you.Minor really. I think its great though and give it 4 stars.,4
Lact-Aid Nursing Trainer Deluxe Lact Aid Lactation Aid,"I love this item, this has saved me n my daughters breastfeeding relationship. I used kt like crazy while waiting for milk to come in.

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We've been using this booster seat for about a year now. I bought it (along withFisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Scatterbug) because I new we would be eating somewhere else at least once a week every week. It is very convenient, very useful, and very durable. I probably would not use it as our permanent high chair at home, but for going out it is the best option I've seen.",5
"Innobaby Sippin' Smart EZ Flow Straw Sippy Cup, Green, 10 Ounce",A friend recommended this cup to me and I'm so glad I gave it a try! It eliminates that problem of not being able to drink the last ounce in the cup because the straw doesn't reach! This straw is weighted so if your child tilts the cup while drinking they can still get out the liquid. The straw is very easy to suck...my 10 month old has no problem. I love the air release valve that lets the pressure out so it doesn't squirt everywhere. My only complaint is the snap lid that goes over the straw is very big and can get in the way. I end up just taking it off most of the time. I plan on purchasing a few more!,4
Maya Wrap Lightly Padded Ring Sling - Burnt Orange - Medium,"The Maya wrap was a great purchase.  Its easy to get on and off, its made of strong durable fabric that stands up to washing, I love plum color, it has a handy pocket big enough for quite a few things (phone, keys, cash/cards, pacifier, burp cloth) so its great to throw on if I just need to run to the corner store and don't want to deal with the diaper bag and stroller.  I've actually gotten several compliments on how attractive the sling looks. I am 5'2"" and 120 pounds - I originally ordered the medium but returned it for the small because the tail on the medium was too long (my baby is also very petite).  I  have the Moby wrap, the Beco Gemini and the Maya wrap, and I now use the Maya wrap the most with my 9 month old.  I loved the Moby when baby was a newborn, but I eventually wanted something I could take on and off quickly and easily and wear around the house.  The Beco is great for longer walks, but the Maya wrap is the sling I take everywhere and use the most.  I can easily stuff it in my diaper bag, which I can't do with the others.  I use it if my little one is fussy and just wants to be held, or if she gets restless in her stroller while shopping.  The fabric scoops under her little butt and comes up nice and high so I always feel like she's secure.  I usually like to keep a hand on her while she's in the Maya, and I didn't like to use it with her when she was newborn because it didn't have as much support as the other two, but now its my favorite.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We've been using this as a high chair for our kid since he was about 10 months old. He's now 19 months old, and we love this thing. Fits on one of our normal kitchen chairs (so no extra stuff in our kitchen dining area), holds him securely, and cleans up very easy. Just make sure you clean under the seat every so often, quite a lot of stuff ends up between this booster seat and the chair.Additionally, you can just take this thing with you when you go on vacation or even just to a friends house for dinner, very portable and sets up in seconds.",5
"Excellante' Wooden High Chair, Walnut (Packaging May Vary)",Please pay attention to the estimated shipping time of 1 to 2 months.Your child might be too old to use the chair by the time it arrives.Is it any good? I guess I won't know for another month or so. I've been waiting 3 weeks and it hasn't shipped. A few more weeks of waiting before they get around to shipping it.I guess they have to wait until they chop down some trees in a tropical rainforest and then send to wood to a sweatshop in China to be milled and then put in a cargo container to come across the ocean. Who knows. Why not just say 'unavailable' if you can't ship it within a week? Why make people wait months?,1
"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","We were in a car accident 4 days after my baby boy was born.  The car accident was a pretty major one - but my baby slept through the entire thing.  The car seat protected him completely, and was virtually untouched.  Per recommendation, we replaced the car seat with the exact same model.  After it worked so well the first time, we figured we'd get the same model again!",5
"Peg Perego USA Rialto Booster Seat, Arancia","We call this the Cadillac of all highchairs, lol. Love this highchairs. Fits chair easy and firmly. Easy remove able tray and cleaning it up is simple. Removeable padding to wash out good that may be hiding under edge. My only suggestion is to look at the table u will be using it with. My table has a ledge or lip on the underside and the chair with or with out tray, highest setting or lowest setting will not fit up against the table, so when time to use as a booster without tray, time for new table.",5

"Chicco Liteway Stroller, Fuego","The short lower strap on the seat makes it hard to put on my son who is only 6 month.It's too tight! And the shield is what I want to complain most.It's almost useless! When I take my son out for walk, he is always directly exposed to the sunlight which is really fierce here in CA especially during summer.So another shield is needed to add more shelter for the baby or you can put an umbrella over the stroller, but it's not easy to do that.What I like about it are: 1.the lightweight of the stroller  2.the price",4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","I've been very happy with the Prince Lionheart foam edging.  It comes with enough tape to cover both edges of the entire strip, and the tape is a good quality 3M tape.  I have a large fireplace and was able to get around it with the 12' and still have about 1' to spare.  I cleaned the bricks first, and so far the tape is holding it fairly well.  I did not use the corners, but rather cut a &#34;V&#34; into the top of the strip in order to make my own corner, and it worked very well.  The corners were a bonus that I could use on another little end table.",5

BABYBJORN Eat &amp; Play Smock - Blue,The picture of the smock on the website is probably the older version since I had this same smock for my older son.

The First Years Breastflow Starter Set,"I thought these were going to be wonderful. They way they work really made sense to me. I bought these for my son at 12 weeks and it was too much work for him.It took him forever to finish a bottle. We breastfeed and he takes a Playtex drop-ins bottle at daycare. These would probably be a good solution for those that have not tried a bottle yet, or have not found a bottle that works.",3

I called Halo, and they said to return them to Amazon, but if Amazon wouldn't take them back, Halo would replace them for me free of charge.",1

When I got it, it was everything I hoped it would be. Not only was it delivered quickly, but the color was exactly like the picture. To the touch the padding is nice and plush, including the head support. Which suggests the baby will be comfortable when placed in it. I cannot wait to put our little man in it. It was well worth the hunt/wait.",5

Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I had used an older model Diaper Genie & threw it out before my daughter was even potty-trained.  I've used a new model Genie at my Sister's house & found it inconvenient to open & push squishy diapers through.  I have used the Dekor for 4 months & love it.  While they are only breast-fed baby diapers, not a toddler's, it is located right next to the head of my bed & I have never smelled any odor coming from it.  I also use cloth diapers at home so I only need to empty this 1 time/week so breastfed stool, or not, they stink after a week & I can't smell them while they are in here & the lid is closed.  Much easier to get those runny diapers into also!",5
"Combi Cocorro Lightweight Convertible Car Seat, Carrot Cake","My daughter absolutely hates being in her infant carrier car seat. As she was approaching 5 months old, I went on a quest to find a great convertible car seat at a reasonable price that would fit into a small backseat. This seat fit all the requirements. I love the color (we chose carrot cake). The infant insert is great as our daughter is prone to blow-outs. This lets us just wash the insert instead of having to strip down the entire seat. If we did have to strip it down, it wouldn't be a problem since the cover is designed to be easily removed.People seem to have issue with the ""puzzle"" buckle, but I found it very easy to operate. The seat seems to be comfortable for my daughter. She is a tall, skinny baby and has plenty of room to grow with this seat. The best part is that my husband can sit with the front seat adjusted to his comfort level (he is over 6ft) and there is room to spare between the car seat and the back of the front seat.Installation. It was a pain. The manual, while thorough, is poorly done. For instance, when installing the seat with Latch, does the latch belt run between the seat and the pad, or over part of the pad, etc. I finally figured it out, but it took much longer than it should have. I tried to install the seat 3 times (and read the manual 6 times) before I felt like I had a good install. That seems typical for most of the reviews I read for this seat. Now that I understand the install, I feel like I could re-do it in any car much quicker. We chose the latch install with the upper tether anchored to the floor (with the included tether adapter strap). The seat is solid.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"Gate looks like it would work great if you're thinking of using it as the ""superyard"" it's designed to be; however, for any of you who are simply looking to block off a thru-way larger than 8 feet -- like I was -- this gate will not work. It says right in the instructions not to use it in a ""straight"" position. The main problem is that there is no way to mount it to the wall. We tried to sturdy it by propping it between the partial walls on each side of the thru-way on one side and our couch on the other. This kept the gate upright, but it was very unsturdy so we decided to return it and look for something else.Unfortunately, the only other gate I've found so far that is large enough to block our 9 foot space is the Keepsafe Expansion gate",4
Holgate HZ673 Recycle Truck Toy,"Durable. Wooden. Virtually indestructible. The price seems a bit high if you're new to buying wooden toys, but you're buying a toy that will last for YEARS.

"Jeep Traveler Tandem Stroller, Spark",sometimes the umbrellas fall off but good i really like the bag. I will shop with this company again I would recommend this company to anyone,4
Baby Jogger 2013 City Select Stroller with Second Seat - Onyx,"I use it as a single stroller for the moment (the baby still not born yet !), so I cannot comment on it as a double stroller.I changed because my City Mini (that I LOVED) broke after 2 years of heavy use and because I am 7 months pregnant. So a double stroller convertible to a single was a wise choice. We don't have a car and thus we use the stroller most of the time for our day-to-day traveling.As a single stroller, it is sturdy and feels very strongly built compared to my first stroller, but it is sooo heavy! I cannot climb stairs with it (note that my son is 35lbs) and pushing it for more than 2km is exhausting (I am 7 months pregnant... maybe normal :-). With my previous City Mini, I was used to the easy one-hand closing system. Now I have use my two hands to close the stroller... and moreover to take out the seat to really make is flat. The stroller doesn't stand on its own, or sometimes when you are lucky it does but you have to put the wheels in a certain way and have the handle in a long position... which is complicated.That's for the bad part, but I still give it a four stars because it is after all a double stroller, and it HAS to be sturdy and heavy to hold two kids at the same time. It is narrow as a single stroller can be, and very easy to manoeuvre. It has a great look and folds flat. It has a huge storage space with an easy access and a large canopy.I just need to buy an &#34;umbrella&#34; stroller for the shorter runs!",4
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,"This is great for reaching the sinnk to brush teeth or get up on the """"mommy potty"""".  It is small enough to keep hidden in our tiny bathroom between the sink and the tub.And it matches my daughter's potty.  The top comes clean very easily- love this!",5

"Eddie Bauer Classic Wood High Chair, Brooke","I love this high chair. I wanted to pay extra to get something that looked a little less clunky and out of place in the dining room and this chair NAILED it.Besides looking great and polishing up nice it has a couple features I'm seriously thrilled about(I also just want to add that my seat cover stays up  just fine o.O. all you have to do is pull the tabs through the wood and mine never comes out.):*ONE HANDED tray slide. It is incredibly annoying  when you have a baby in your arms and you need to use BOTH hands to unlock the tray. Not with t his high chair. You use one hand on the front and it easily slides back and forth. Yay!*STORAGE space! I love this thoughtful little add-on. I fill it with bibs, burp cloths, spoons and bowls. There is even plenty of room for a few toys thrown in there.*REMOVABLE tray. After my son makes a horrible mess it's easy to snap out the upper tray, give him some toys to slobber on and go clean it. Once clean I just snap it back in. Easy.A lot of people complain this high chair isn't easy to clean, but I haven't had an issue. I actually think it is EASIER to clean than the clunky  gismo I had before. I can just throw the fabric in the wash if I need to and don't need to sit by the sink grimacing as I wipe slime off plastic.I think the price was worth it. Enjoy!",5

The first time we put him in it, he was only a month old and he was fussy. But we tried it again a few weeks later and he loved it! He especially likes it when he can face out and see the world.

"babyletto Grayson Mini Crib with Mattress Pad, Espresso","I spent a lot of time looking at mini cribs before deciding on this one. Most other brands seemed flimsy. I wanted a """"real"""" crib from the first day we brought baby home that would fit in our bedroom. My first child slept so much better on a real mattress compared to a bassinet or pack-n-play. This crib has two level options which is nice for the first few months. The 3 inch mattress works great and it is not recommended to use anything thicker if you plan to use the top level. I also purchased a breathable bumper (mini-crib size) which also fits great. The wood is beautiful and the manufacturing quality is good. We purchased and assembled about 8 weeks before baby arrived. It took about an hour to assemble. It did have a bit of an odor for the first few weeks so I am glad we did this ahead of time. Baby is now six months old and still has plenty of room and she is no shrimp (90% in length). I anticipate she will be able to stay in it for 18 months and maybe more if she is not a crib jumper. I am completely satisfied with this purchase and glad I did not go with a cheaper option.",5
"FuzziBunz Fleece Changing Pad, Light It Up Blue","For some reason, this changing pad seemed a lot bigger online than it actually was when I received it.  At 18 months, my daughter had outgrown most of the conventional changing pads on the market, which are sized for newborn and infants (under 12 months).  So I was looking for an extra-large, portable pad that I could change my toddler's diaper on without her arms, legs or head coming into contact with the dirty surfaces of most public changing stations.  Unfortunately, this Fuzzibunz changing pad was too small for that purpose.  It is, however, pretty handy for changing my little-one on the bed or sofa, or whenever we need a soft, flat surface at home.Grade: B (3.5 stars)",3
Simple Wishes D*LITE Hands Free Breastpump Bra (XS-L),"I'm so glad I got a hands-free bra.  It allows me to play a little with my baby while I pump, which is so helpful.  I can't say this one is better or worse than others since it's the only one I've tried, but it works really well for me.  I use the hospital-grade Madela pump, but I believe this bra supposedly works with any pump brand.  It's relatively comfortable and doesn't seem to leak at all.",5

Throw the washcloth in the laundry.Your baby will be fresh, have NO diaper rash, enjoy the warmth of the wash cloths,and you won't have to haul all this stuff around. It's also cheaper and easier onthe environment.",1
,"They show these being used on a cabinet, but I disagree. The lock has a straight shaft, causing the latch to not properly align with the locking mechanism - on a cabinet the end of the door is swinging in an arc and the straight shaft catches the edge of the lock everytime.  This is especially true for small cabinet doors (less than 12&#34; across), as in these the ratio of latch shaft length to door arc is higher. Many of these have now ripped loose and no longer function.  Maybe better for a drawer where the motion is straight in and out.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"These bottles are absolutely the best!  My baby used Medela, Healthflow and bottles given to us from the hospital and was gassy all the time! Then we tried the Avent bottles and it worked great!  No gas for the baby and slow flow cause I'm still breastfeeding.  I would recommend this item to all new mothers. If you have problems with the bottle leaking, you have screwed the cover on too tight.  I had to do some research on why it leaked and was glad.  Also the Avent Isis pump is great too!  I like that it is quiet, only regret I wish it was electric.  I have an electric Medela pump but still prefer the Avent Isis.",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,"I purchased this product late in my third trimester. It was so inexpensive and I was having so much trouble sleeping that I knew I didn't have anything to lose in trying it.  I didn't think it would do much, but this little wedge has done WONDERS for me!  I went from tossing and turning uncomfortably all night to sleeping soundly almost all night (except having to get up to pee!)  I use it under my belly, which allows me to finally get comfortable on my side. I am a back/belly sleeper normally and could never figure out how to make side sleeping work. I also wedge it behind my back if I find myself rolling onto my back a lot--it keeps me from rolling over. This pillow has worked way better for me than putting pillows between my legs, and way better than a body pillow.  Another reviewer mentioned that this helped her with pelvic pain, and it did the same for me! No more excruciating pains when I get out of bed, and much better throughout the day!I can't recommend this product enough, and only wish I had purchased it sooner! Really, what do you have to lose at this price? It's worth a try.",5

The only reason I give it 4 instead of 5, is that when the bath is over and therefore no more hot water, the cold water alarm goes off.  Probably just lazy operator who cant find the off switch.  Oh well",4

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My daughter LOVES this toy.  My husband and I bought it for her when she was about 3.5 months old and she's been playing with it ever since.  There are so many textures and sounds for her to explore.  We hung it on an overhead toy bar and she just lays underneath it and bats at the wings so they make a crinkle noise. Freddie Firefly keeps her entertained for long periods of time.,5
Annabel Karmel Fill and Freeze Puree Pops,"I love these little Popsicles and our son does too! They are easy to fill with a little apple sauce or other fruit puree, easy for the baby to hold onto and gum, absolutely the best for numbing teething pain.Pros:1. If your kid can hold a rattle to his/her mouth, they can use this popsicle (much earlier than a stick handled popsicle which requires you to aim at your mouth...)2. Small.  I can fill all 4 with a 3.5ounce jar of baby apple sauce, very convenient.3. Great for early teething pain, I even took one out of town and froze it there.4. Dishwasher Safe, we throw them in a baby dishwasher basketMunchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket, Colors May VaryCons:1. My molds did have some damage from snapping apart individual popsicles when frozen, specifically the little studs that interlock the individual popsicles together so all 4 molds stand up together in the freezer. The breakage however, did not affect the ability to make the popsicles. After I broke one connector studs off I was more gentle with the unsnapping and have not broken any more of the connectors.Realistically the company should probably make a base to hold individual molds that does not require them to be snapped at all, but the molds themselves are durable, release the popsicle easily and have been washed in the dishwasher repeatedly without any problems beyond the superficial breakage of the connectors due to my handling of the frozen plastic.",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",This product is a lifesaver and a back saver!!!This makes pumping SO easy and comfortable!It works perfectly and fits really well. Eases the strain on my back and allows me to relax while pumping. Don't know what I would do without it!!,5
EvenFlo SmartSteps Exersaucer Entertainer,I PURCHASED THIS EXERSAUCER FOR MY INFANT SON. I DIDN'T HAVE ONE FOR MY 2 YEAR OLD BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE ONE THAT FOLDED THEN. I LOOKED AT ALL OF THEM AND CHOSE THIS ONE. I LIKE ALL THE TOYS THIS ONE CAME WITH. I USUALLY PUT ALL MY KIDS THINGS TOGETHER BY MYSELF. (HUSBAND IS VERY LAZY!) THIS ONE WAS VERY TRICKY. I HAD A HARD TIME PUTTING THE LEGS ON THE SAUCER. THERE IS A SPRING THAT NEEDS TO BE HOOKED ON TO THE SAUCER AND IS VERY TRICKY ATTACHING. AFTER THAT POINT IT WAS SMOOTH SAILING. MY SON IS ONLY 3 MONTHS OLD BUT HOLDS HIS HEAD UP VERY WELL. HE SAT IN IT AND WAS LOOKING AT EVRYTHING. I THINK HE WILL LOVE IN SOON. FOLDING IT IS VERY EASY. DON'T FORGET THE BATTERIES! (6 AAA) IT ISN'T PRINTED ON THE BOX IN A NOTICABLE SPOT.,4
"Manhattan Toy Soft Activity Book with Tethered Toy, Buzzing Through","Nice soft book, interesting images and things to flip up, etc.  Only issue was one of the pages was not ironed flat properly, so kind of annoying but my baby doesn't notice I'm sure.",4
"Tadpoles 36 Sq Ft ABC Floor Mat, Pink/Brown","Great mat - exactly as we expected it to be. We love the colors - they're not quite as pink and girlie as it looks in the picture. The only warning I have is that if you're placing this over carpet, the tiles and letters/numbers pop up really easily when you walk on the mat. It's not a problem per se, but something to be aware of.",4
"Step By Step Jungle Friends Mobile, Pink","Our daughter loves this in her crib.  She cries when it shuts off, if the only thing they could do to improve it is have it run non-stop!  Easy to put together and put on the crib.",5

"Ju-Ju-Be Be Hip Bag, Brown/Bubblegum","I LOVE this bag.  The strap is the right length, not too short not too long.  It has just the right amount of space and pockets, without being bulky.  I bought this to use for more every day errands to carry the bare necessities.  It is so much more then that.  Ju Ju Be got this one right.  I should also say I have the Ju Ju Be Best Friend bag.  Its a good bag, kind of bulky and the strap was a little short.",5

DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"Disappointed and will be returning product tomorrow. The description states in runs on 4 batteries and we were intending to use it in our trailer for our baby when we go camping. Well, it does not work with batteries except on demo mode. What a ridiculous design. Wish the description had been accurate so we wouldn't have wasted our time.",1
Carter's Cradle and Soothe Sweet Daisy Bouncer,This is an excellent bouncer. It reclines and is cushy. However my daughter is really long legged and her legs hang off the end even though she meets the height requirements but this has happened alot. It's the same thing with any bouncer I get and even her infant car seat. So I would not blame this problem on the bouncer at all. Over all we loved it. A+,5

"Regalo Extra Wide 58 Inch WideSpan Walk Through Safety Gate, White",When it arrive it did not fit either to big or to little for opening. I called the customer service number and they sent the exact part I need and the fit was perfect. Attaching to the the opening was effortless. It also had the look I was looking for,5
Jeep Stroller Mesh Bag,"Very disappointed in this bag. My daughter bought a similar mesh bag at Babies R Us by Prince Lionhart...and she paid double for it.  But as the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for"".  This bag is about the same size but has very little stretch to the top of the bag so it's very hard to get anything in it.  My daughters bag will hold two medium size purses but I couldn't even get one in this bag.  For $5 it wasn't worth returning so I put it on the umbroller stroller to put toys, or a blanket in.  I bought the Prince Lionhart and am much happier with it on my big stroller. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone wanting to carry anything more than a small blanket or a small toy or two.",1
10PC BLACK WHITE &amp; RED CRIB NURSERY BEDDING SET UNIQUE,I love this product! My baby girl is due to arrive around Christmas and I can't wait to set up her crib and this adorable new baby bedding set I purchased at Amazon!,5
"BABYBJORN Bouncer Balance Soft, Black/Gray, Mesh","This chair is tops. Besides having all the qualities of a regular bouncy chair (gentle rocking, a safe spot for baby, lightweight portability, a small footprint), this bouncer actually looks good. The colors are rich and attractive, sort of a deep wine color and a red-orange accent.The fabric is soft, the chair is nice and cozy, and you don't have to unfasten everything to pop the baby into the restraint, thanks to the design and the stretchy fabric. But the design means that gravity does a good job of holding the baby in place.There are 4 settings--fully reclined, partially reclined, more or less upright, and folded down.Actually, the flat-fold makes this the best bouncer I've seen, as it can go pretty much completely flat to store out of the way or take along on vacation or to a friend's house. I've dragged our other bouncy chair enough places and awkwardly tetrised it into my car enough times to really appreciate the flat fold.My 8-month baby loves it. She's clearly more comfy and less squirmy than in either of her other chairs, and she seems very snug and secure. When the baby outgrows the bouncy/restraint setting, you can reverse the cover and use it as a simple, elegant toddler chair. I'm really excited to have baby furniture that's both modern in design and without any loud or twee prints. Huzzah!But I have to take off one star for value. It's just so dang expensive, even for such an awesome little chair. Given its limited useful life, it's an awful lot to pay for a cloth-covered wire frame, ingenious as it is. If money were no object, I'd give it 5 stars.",4

Beco Gemini Baby Carrier - Paige,"This carrier is wonderful!  Everywhere I go, people ask what it is and where I got it.  It is so comfortable and easy to get on and off and my son (who is 14 mos.) loves being in it.  I usually use the front carry, but he is getting bigger, so I will probably use the hip and back carry more.  I looked at carriers for a while (I used a Bjorn when my kids where very little, but they outgrew it so quickly) and after reading a lot of reviews, I chose this one and I'm glad I did!  This is a must have for any mom.",5
"JJ Cole Satchel Diaper Bag, Green Arbor","I fell in love with this bag online, but just checked it out at BRU. The bag looks sleek in pictures, but it's made of a cheap-looking canvas material and the upper part(the part without the pattern) bulges out in a strange way for such a structured bag. The handles also looked and felt like cheap plastic and are the kind of material that would scratch easily. It's not clear what color the lining is for this product on Amazon, but the one I looked at had a garish lime green. I thought that wouldn't bother me, but if you have the bag open or tilted at all the green is very noticeable even from far away. The bag looked less like luggage in person, which is good if you think it looks uncomfortable to carry (I thought it would be from the pictures), but bad if you're trying to avoid something flimsy. Overall, it's a cute style that suffers from really poor materials.",2
"OXO Tot Sippy Cup with Handles, Aqua, 7 Ounce","I did not buy this through Amazon, but do most of my shopping here so wanted to review anyway. Love OXO stuff and thought this cup would be great. However, the first time my son threw this thing and it hit the floor, the silicone valve (which prevents leaking) detached from the underside of the lid and fell into the juice inside the cup. Which meant juice rapidly started going everywhere. This one's a leak bomb and a loser, folks. Love OXO products as always but this one needs some more thought.",1
"Safety 1st Finger Pinch Guard, 2 Pack","It keeps my two year old and four year old from slamming their bedroom doors.  I'd give it six stars if I could!  However, if you don't want to spend the few bucks on this, just drape a towel over the top of the door.  I only heard about that after I bought these. But I'm still happy with them as they are a bit more attractive than a towel thrown over the door ;)",5
"Chicco Liteway Stroller, Fuego","I previously owned a City Mini stroller which I absolutely loved. But when baby #2 was almost due, I decided to sell the City Mini and bought the Joovy Caboose Double Stroller. I quickly realized what a mistake that was since double stroller is really bulky and my 3 year old preferred to sit in the front. I can't really afford to buy a new City Mini, so after researching other options, I decided to buy Chicco Liteway Stroller. To my surprise, I find this stroller to be as good as the City Mini. Okay, it does not fold in 1 step, but it does recline as well. The foot cover, bendable leg rest and easy access bottom stroller definitely makes up for the 1 step fold. It stirs really well too.",4

Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,I normally do not write reviews but do spend alot of time reading them when It comes to my kids safty.  The gate is very well made with the exception of the hinges.  With in a few months of my son walking he broke three of the hinges.  They are thin plastic and if you have a high energy kid as my 14month old is they will break.  My son loves to pull on the gate as we have it wall mounted to block of the T.V and fish tank.  Well as I found out it took him no time to break the small plastic hinges.  When I called Regalo they told me they could not replace the parts as they only have a 90 day warrenty.  The gate door is amazing but if using it to keepy your high energy young ones out of an area watch out.  If the hinges are not perfectly placed the will start by bending the gate at the hinges and than one day SNAP and the gate will come down.,2
"Britax B-Agile and B-Safe Travel System, Red","My son is not quite 2 months old but so far I love this!  The stroller is so smooth and light and easy to handle.  The basket IS on the small side, but I just use a mommy hook and that does most of the carrying of things that I need.  The car seat is a little heavy, but not terrible.  That is the only thing I would improve on this system.  My son does get sweaty in the car seat when he gets all worked up and crying when he doesn't want to be in it, but just calm he is fine and not hot and sweaty.  I love the big canopy of the stroller and the carseat, together they can completely shade/cover the baby.  Overall I would recommend it!",5

"Chicco KeyFit 22 Infant Car Seat, Chevron","I was going to buy the KeyFit 30 until someone told me to get the smallest infant car seat possible, because it is very unlikely that your baby will fit in his or her infant car seat until the 30 pound weight limit. This was great advice. This seat has every great feature of the KeyFit 30, without the extra weight.The KeyFit is the best infant car seat on the market. You truly have to be an fool to install it improperly because it is so easy. The base is incredibly easy to level and the straps are incredibly easy to adjust.Also, if you have premature babies, as we did, and have to bring them home before they reach 5 pounds, this is one of the only seats on the market, if not the only one, that is rated down to 4 pounds.",5
"Carter's Green Elephant Valance, Green/Choc, 60 X 14&quot;",I am expecting my first child and I am not finding out what I am having so this is the perfect print and colors.

"Evenflo Classic Johnny Jump Up, Frogs","We had one of these for my son 33 years ago, and it was the BEST toy ever.  We also had a large dog who loved to get under his toes and let him push off of the dog's head.  My son would often go to sleep in it, and his dad's business partner (we kept it at work) came up with the phrase, ""Oops, dead paratrooper position again.""So now I am buying one for my son's son--SO GLAD they still make this wonderful device, and so glad my son lives in a very old house so the clips will fit the door frames.  I'll bet it will be one of your child's favorites, too--",5
Disney Sofia the First Toddler Sneakers Size 8,"Me and my daughter love these shoes. Super cute design. Though she hasn't worn them a lot yet, as we got them a size big for room to grow, they seem to be well-made enough to survive the short amount of time a toddler will wear them before outgrowing. Easy to put on for a little wiggle worm, and will stay put fairly well (when they fit well, of course). Good deal for the money.",5

"timi &amp; leslie Charlie 7-Piece Diaper Bag Set, Light Brown","I got this bag as a gift when I was pregnant. I was excited about having a stylish diaper bag that could double as my purse. When I got it I noticed it was HUGE. Wow, this is a really big bag so if you have a small frame keep that in mind.The bag is awesome, the amount of room it has and the organization in it is wonderful. It fits everything so well! And you can't tell by the picture but the way the zipper part is done you can load the bag up to the rim and not have an issue zipping it. I can't describe it but the top part gets raised up when it's full and the zipper never gets in the way. Genius design.It comes with a small purse which I love. I carry my wallet and car keys etc in that and if I drop baby off at grandma's I leave the main bag and just take the little purse with my stuff in it. Again, genius design.I love it a lot BUT THERES A HUGE BUT ... the bag is not nearly as sturdy as it needs to be for this purpose. Right when I got it one handle started falling apart. Now after 3 months use the inside buckle has ripped and the thermal bottle holder has fallen apart and ripped. I'm so sad about this. I wish it was made a bit sturdier. They thought of everything for the bag why didn't they think that lugging this big bag around requires something that can handle a little more wear-and-tear? I use it very gently but sad to say it's probably not going to last as long as I thought.Would give it 3.5 stars.",3
"Woolzies 3 XL Wool Dryer Balls ,Natural Fabric Softener",I bought 2 packages of these to make 6 balls altogether since that is what the suggestion is for a large load.  They have worked great!  I just leave them in my dryer at all times.  You do have to be careful when taking the clothes out because they do fall out easily and roll around.  I have not gotten any static cling since using them.  I am so happy to not have to use any chemical dryer sheets anymore!,5

She can stare at this mobile for 20-30 minutes at a time, which for a 2 month old, is a really long time! The toys are bright and colorful and the movement of the mobile really keeps the baby engaged. We use it several times a day. I love the music selections because they aren't annoying for the adults in the house like some other baby mobiles/toys. Great product and a great value.",5
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","We have had had this for two years and are not impressed with the product. The lid has no rubber seals to seal the odor inside and  the mechanism inside simply pinches the bag together after the lid closes to attempt to seal the contents from the outside world - it doesn't do a very good job and the sealing mechanism is not robust. Perhaps if the lid had rubber seals it would block odor better. I think diaper genie used to twist the bag around each diaper to seal them individually, seems like that would work better than the internal ''sealing'' mechanism that ails in my opinion. Our kitchen foot pedal tash can does a Better job sealing odors.",2
"Summer Infant Dr. Mom Nursery Essentials, Blue","As a first time mom the kit was something I thought I had to have. I only use a couple of the things in it. The fingernail clippers are a normal size, not the baby ones. So, I had to buy infant nail clippers separately. The suction bulb is quite stiff and therefore doesn't suction. The brush is about the only thing I use. Which I guess is a good thing. If I had a baby that was sick often then this kit would be good, it has almost every type of thermometer. I did end up buying an ear thermometer separately. Even for travel the case is too large. So I wish I hadn't bought this",3

"Joovy Scooter X2 Double Stroller, Greenie","Just buy it...this was definitely one of my best purchases in a long time.  Both of my children fit comfortably (35lbs and 22lbs) despite both being long (&#62;95 % length).  It is easy to maneuver, fits through ALL doors, and the front bar comes in hands when you have to pull the stroller through those pesky doors of stores that cannot keep the automatic button in working condition.  This is far lighter than my double stroller and my kids love sitting side by side.  I also really like that both seats recline back all the way so that my baby can nap even if we are out and about during nap time.  BUY IT!!! P.S. the basket in the bottom is huge and everything is easily accessible.  Definitely the right by for us.",5

Really LOVE my Brest Friend! Super cute fabric to boot!",5

Maclaren Volo Stroller - Charcoal/Silver,"I've had this stroller for four years through two kids and was always a bit confused as to why this was the stroller I saw everywhere in NYC, Paris, etc. It doesn't recline (which I knew when I bought it, obviously) and although it says you can use it from 6 months and up, a smaller baby just sort of slumps down in the seat. Straps that can be adjusted more tightly would help. I had to tie a knot with the straps to get them to work at an early stage.So why am I now sold on the Volo? After years of using it just occasionally as my car stroller, we took it to Disney World for our 2 year old to sit in. I was glad we didn't bring a bigger stroller like the Joovy Ultralight Caboose we were considering taking because we had to fold it down and hold it on the shuttle buses we took from park to park. My 4 year old wound up wanting to ride in it a lot, and it held her with our 2 year old on her lap (combined 65 pounds) fine. It also held my almost seven year old niece. In the airport, I was able to hang a child's suitcase from the handle and push it with one hand with my 40 pound 4 year old inside. This thing is indestructible. I finally get it. If you're going to be rough on your stroller and don't want the frame to buckle or the fabric to rip, and you want to be able to fold it up quickly and carry it easily, then you should seriously consider this stroller. I got mine on sale at BRU four years ago . . . definitely worth the investment!",4

Primo Freedom Trainer (Toilet Trainer) (White),My friend had this for her grandkids and they loved it -- so I purchased one for mine to use.

So far, I did my job well because the Graco Turbobooster is exactly what I wanted.  It was easy to assemble, the seat is padded nicely (just like it says), and my son has a ball with his cupholders (used mainly for holding cars) and the neck pillow- which he uses EVERY time we get in the car.

I found these and I think they are just the cutest things ever!I love the shape too so that as they have become older, they can helphold the bottle too. They have withstood my brood and we wash in dishwasher all the time. I would get the big and the small. They are awesome!!",5
Safety 1st: Rockin' Jitter Buggy,"I was so excited when I put this together for my son.  He has played in the Baby Einstein exersaucer and was thrilled with everything!  I placed him in the Jitter Buggy and he bounced a bit, then stared at me.  Nothing in it really captures his attention.  I want him to explore, I don't want to have to do it for him!  The sounds can only happen one at a time, which is a major flaw to me, because out of the ""11 toys to entertain baby"", 4 of them are the sound making toys hooked up to the D batteries. (The cell phone has sounds and it's own battery pack, but it just plain sucks. The company counts the 3 cars on a wire as 3 separate toys, as well as 2 mirrors.)  So, if the radio is playing, he has to wait before anything else makes a sound (or it cuts off the radio).Here is what I liked about the Jitter Buggy:1.  Great idea for an exersaucer2.  The turn signals, vibrations and horn are cool3.  The bouncing is very entertaining to baby!Here is what I don't like about the Jitter Buggy1.  Poorly thought out anf constructed; it could have been so much cooler and educational.2.  Not enough stimulating toys to capture baby's interest for more than a couple of minutes.3.  From seat to floor of toy is almost too tall...My baby is in the 50th percentile for his age 27"" at 5 months, but he is on his toes!  The seat adjuster is all the way out!  Max height is 32"" on this toy.4.  Seat is too wide and doesn't spin freely.  Once again, I had to spin him.I was just very disappointed in this, and I am returning it for the Graco Baby Einstein exersaucer.",2
"Summer Infant Changing Pad Cover, Who Loves You Owl",My daughters nursery room theme is owls. This was the perfect fit! First it came FAST! Within two days. I was amazed with how soft it is and fits perfectly on my changing pad (which is not the same brand). I am so glad we purchased this one without seeing it in person. For the price and quality you can't beat it. Plus it's adorable!!,5
Baby Looney Tunes Baby Receiving Blankets - Flannel 3 Pack,"[...]Great blanckets! Well, I got it for my baby that we are still excpecting our due is at the end of September 2010...  The yello one feels more softer then the green ones, but the green ones are still soft.  I did not get a chance to wash it to tell you how this product looks after the washing, does it fade away, or bleed any colors...., I assume that it will not have any deffects after I wash it multiple times it I follow the care instruction correctly.  It really matching my baby crib comforter set [...]  But again, you might want to search for the better deal like  [...]",5
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe Adjustable Infant Wrap, 3-Pack, Mom &amp; Baby","I love the material, it's nice and soft. I washed them and they still have the softness and quality. Happy with the purchase.",5
Ingenuity Washable Playard With Dream Centre - Shiloh,"I'm a grandmother and it's perfect for my grandson. He suffers from acid reflux and the playard comes with an incline capability for such cases. It's pretty sturdy, the color is neutral and fun at the same time and I also like the deluxe tray.",5
Airplane Squirt Toy Party Accessory,I got this for my daughter for Christmas.  Her Daddy is a pilot so she gets to run around pretending to fly her own plane.  She loves it.,5
"Bugaboo Bee Base Stroller, Black","We bought the Bugaboo Bee for our son 2 years ago. Over the course of those 2 years, we experienced 3 catastrophic failures of the stroller:1. The front wheels have a (now known) issue such that they shake and shimmy if the stroller contents (read: child) aren't balanced perfectly. The only solution is to install front-wheel stickers to reduce the shimmying, and these need to be replaced every year or so.2. After about 1 or so years of use, the front wheel ball bearing assemblies rusted, deformed and fell out. This caused seriously odd noise whenever pushing the stroller, and when the washers finally gave out and the ball bearings fell out, the wheels made loud clicking noises and the stroller became harder to push.3. After about 2 years of use the handlebar clips completely wore out and failed, causing the handlebar locks to stop working. This caused the handlebar to push in and pull out without being able to lock at a certain setting, making pushing the stroller difficult and unwieldy.Bugaboo eventually replaced all broken parts, but not before forcing me to send them pictures, videos, and angry emails about the situation. They also hide behind their 2 year warranty, as if a $600 stroller meant to grow with your child from birth through year 4-5 shouldn't cover the entirety of its lifetime of use. The customer support is generally unresponsive, and when they do respond, they make you feel like everything is your problem and your fault.We didn't put the stroller through inappropriate stress or push it beyond its claimed abilities. We use it daily to walk around our neighborhood in NYC, so it sees all kind of weather, but it isn't abused.To make matters worse, the stroller has absolutely terrible performance on grass, on snow, on dirt, and on gravel of any size and all of the attachments/add-ons are expensive. Its big selling feature, being easily collapsed and lightweight, aren't even true. The CityMini is a far better and cheaper option, and gets far more positive reviews from people I know that have them.",1
"JJ Cole Mode Diaper Tote Bag, Black Magnolia",The diaper bag is the perfect size. And I love all of the pockets it has. The black and white design is perfect so my husband will also be comfortable carrying it.,5
"Tadpoles Four Bulb Chandelier, Pink","The chandelier arrived in no time and was packed well. It would of been easy to install if we could have a full size electrical box on a ceiling, unfortunately we had a very shallow substitute and the bolt was too long, so my husband had to wrap the white tape around the part of the bolt that was supposed to be enclosed in a box. After that it looked just fine. If you do not know the trouble you would never notice the difference. The chandelier looks very cute in my daughter's room, princess like but not too much. One thing though. Looking at the picture I thought that pink will be a little more intense like on a hot pink side, but it is rather very light almost transparent and on a salmon side of pink. Still very nice.",5
"Bella Tunno Ribbon Loop Binker Pacifier Clip, Ocean Stripes/Blue Hawaiian Stripes",$8 for one pacifier clip? I thought it came with 2 so that's why I got it. I could have gotten a cheaper one that works just as well. I didn't read the reviews on here before purchasing (I usually do so I'm kicking myself now) so be warned that the picture that shows 2 clips is just showing each side of the single clip.,2
SmartChoices Feme Pad: 2 Pack,"These are great for post-partum recovery.  They fit great, like a pad, in your underwear, instead of some large bulky icepack from the local drugstore.  They can be sterilized and reused. I have even bought some for shower gifts for a couple of my cousins who are pregnant.  They are one of those things you don't think about until you need it.  Glad I bought them.",5
SpongeBob SquarePants Height Growth Chart up to 5 feet tall,"This height chart was better than I expected for the price I paid on Amazon.  It was thick, heavier material and will last a long time.  It comes with a clip to mark your child's height progression.  It required some assembly but very easy.  Don't hesitate on making this purchase.",5
"dexbaby Safe Sleeper Convertible Crib Bed Rail, White","This does the job that it needs to do, but it could be engineered a little better.  The fit is a little tight even secured on the longest setting ending up squishing the mattress some.  There are other aspects of the products construction that could be better thought out.",3
Bright Starts Lots of Links- Solid Colors,My 4 month old loves to play with her links!  They are nice to attach to the car seat.,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We gave Sophie to our kid when he was 4 months and he still loves it. Loves to chew on the giraffe in all possible ways. Probably not his favorite but he nibbles on it quite often whenever he feels like biting on something,",5
Bright Starts 2-in-1 Convert Me Activity Table and Gym,"This playground doesn't entertain my three months old daughter as much. I noticed she doesn't like the music. She is getting bored very fast, I'm ending up adding our own Lamaze toys so she plays with those. Also the sound pad for feet is not that sensative. She is always sliding from a small pillow that is included. I thought my baby would enjoy it much more",3

Boppy Changing Pad Liners 3-Pack - White,these are SUCH a great idea - I have them layered on my change mat - and just take the top one off to wash when required... saved us SO many times from having to wash the WHOLE change mat.GENIUS!,5
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado",Ordered this item to use with my dry cloth diaper pail. I have been using a 13gallon trash can that I bought at target for the cloth diapers and was going through a lot of trash bags so I wanted to by a reusable trash bag and this item has been working perfectly. fits the trash can/diaper pail perfectly. Fits snug around the top and does not slip.,5
"Carters Keep Me Dry Burp Pads, Pink Circles, 3 Pack","Although these burp cloths look cute, please save your money.  They are small, scratchy and have a strange chemical odor that does not come out even after soaking and washing in Dreft multiple times.  Even my husband picked up on the odor, and he has a poor sense of smell.  He told me to throw them away.  You do not want your little one's face on these burp cloths.",1
Primo Viaggio SIP,We have been using this car seat for 6 weeks now and I wish I hadn't picked it out because of its name. It's not very comfy for him. I always have trouble opening the canopy without it comming off the back. The straps don't pull out easily and I always have a hard time with my sons arms. I don't have trouble getting it out/in the base. It's very light weight.,2
Octopus Pillow,"Really lovely toy - and larger than you'd expect from the pictures. Well made, sturdy, and perfect for baby hugs.",5
BOB Infant Car Seat Adapter for Graco Single Strollers,This was easy to install and works perfectly for the Graco Snugride 30 carseat.The seat clicks in to this frame much like it does on the Graco stroller.My daughter really enjoys being able to see me while we are out in our utility stroller.,5
Playskool Weebles Christmas 2-Pack Mr. and Mrs. Claus,"My daughter loves Weebles, so when I saw these I just had to have them, even if the price was a little steep. They are so cute! I can't wait to give them to her for Christmas! I know she'll be thrilled.",5
Kiddopotamus Elite Duomat 2 in 1 Car Seat Protector Mat,This was a great purchase.  It's substantial in size and texture.  It's alos multi-purpose as you can use if for forward and rear facing car seats because in comes in 2 parts.,5
Bottle Sling Color/Pattern: Blue Puppy,"This product seemed like a good idea, but I could not ever get my son's bottles to stay secured. We use the Playtex Ventaire bottles, which are angled, and no matter how I propped them, the bottle would not stay in the correct position. I does seem to work with regular bottles but unfortunately my son refuses to use anything else but the Ventaires. Though I wish I had been able to utilize this product, I at least was able to return it. And for those individuals who are making negative remarks about this product and the &#34;bad parents&#34; who refuse to hold our children while eating, I only ever tried to use this while parked in our van and my son was hungry or when he was being pushed around in his stroller while shopping. It wasn't feasible for me to twist around to his seat in our van and hold his bottle, nor is he big enough to hold it on his own. He also weighs 17 pounds at 5 months old so it's difficult to hold him and feed him while walking around in a store without my arms falling off. I imagine none of the negative commenters have children of their own, so maybe they should keep their opinions to themselves, especially since it doesn't pertain to this particular product.",4
"Munchkin Deluxe Dishwasher Basket, Colors May Vary","Great product but it only seems to fit the nipples and accessories for THEIR brand of bottles.  I chose two other brands (Dr. Browns and Born Free) and struggle to fit pieces into this caddy, especially the nipples.  Washes well and is well-made.",3
BABYBJ&Ouml;RN Navy Carrier,"Very comfortable and durable. I have washed it twice with only minimal fading.  When my daughter was cranky, I carried her in it and she would fall right asleep. I didn't use it as much as I thought because I prefered having her in the stroller or carrier in shopping cart when we went out because it gets too heavy for long periods of wear. You will use it much more when baby is small. I only used it around the house and now that she is 5 months she is way too heavy for me. For a person of larger stature, it would work great, though.I am only 5 ft tall, and it sizes nicely down to fit me. It does fit my husband (almost 6 ft and 175 lbs), but barely. If Daddy is going to wear it you'll probably need the XL straps.",4
"BRICA By-My-Side Safety Harness Backpack, Pink/Gray",This is a great backpack for my little one but the leash should have been attached a little further north so as to pull more evenly.,4
Cozy Car Seat Microfiber and Fleece Cover- Pink,"Great quality and great priced, looks great with the itzy ritzy Moroccan nights interior car seat cover. I get compliments on this set all the time! Most importantly, it keeps little one warm!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I have had this turtle for 4 years. My kid 4 year old and 1 year old love this. Depending on where you put it in the room it has a really nice effect of showing the stars and the moon on the ceiling in a dark room.,5
"Summer Infant Best View Handheld Color Video Monitor, Sliver/White","I really like this product when it is working.  I love having the video component to the monitor.  There are some problems with bad reception at times, but otherwise it works well - until it doesn't work.  I bought my first one a year ago (in December).  It lasted until April when it just stopped working.  Summer Infant sent me a replacement product, but the one I received was defective.  There was audio but it was so quiet that I had to hold it to my ear to hear if my child was making any noise.  I tried to make it work because I didn't want to complain again, but I had to use a second audio monitor so that I would hear it at night.  I called and they sent me a second replacement, which I received in June, and now the video has gone out.  Customer Service is not very friendly, but they have always replaced the product for me.  At this point I'm not sure if it's even worth getting another replacement.",1
"J.L. Childress Soft Hug First Aid Cool Pack, Brown",The material on teh bear is not soft its acrylic or something.At least i can use the icepack with a washcloth.,2
"Pickles Nummy Animal Snuggly Banky, Pink Bunny, 16 X 16&quot;","Love this lovey.  Very high quality and worth a bit more money because of that.  I have several of one kind for each of my kids (in case of losing one, and for backup when one needs to be washed)  They are holding up beautifully to LOTS of washing, no fading and the kids love them.  The eyes and nose are sewn in so there's nothing to pop off or be swallowed by little ones.  Highly recommend.",5
Snuza Hero Baby Movement Monitor,I absolutely love this!!! I have such peace of mind with my 2 month old now! I think that every single child should have one of these from birth to at least one year old! This is my new shower gift from now on! I can't explain enough how great these things are!!,5
"Graco SnugRide Click Connect 35 Car Seat, Tangerine",The tightening and loosening button right in front in underneath the fabric. So you have to either lift the front of the seat cover off of the car seat frame to get to it or put your finger down a slit in the fabric to blindly try and push it so you can loosen the straps. It's incredibly annoying.,3
"C.R. Gibson Bound Keepsake Memory Book of Baby's First 5 Years, Lulu",The book was just what my daughter wanted to write all the milestones for her new baby girl.  The book and the contents were just like it was pictured on the web site.  Many sites were on back order but received the book within 5 days.,5
"Jeep Adventure Jogging Stroller, Black","My stroller arrived with a flat tire.  Customer service informed me this is not a warranty item.  They would not cover it and basically told me to spend more money on fix a flat or a new tube.  I expect a $200 stroller to be in working order when I purchase it.  I'm very disappointed and wish I would have returned it.Update:My initial rating was one star due to poor customer service.  After many emails and more than a month, the company agreed to send me a new tire, unfortunately it was a front tire instead of the rear.  I purchased tire selant and the tire has not gone flat again.  My son and I have gone on several walks on gravel, he seemed comfortable in both the stroller and when we attached the infant carrier.  My biggest complaint about the stroller itself is how it collapses.  I cannot fold the stroller while holding my son.  I store the stroller in the garage so it isn't a big deal, but it would be a challenging if I needed to collapse after each use.",3
Lambs &amp; Ivy Slip Covered Chair in Teddy Bear Story,"This chair is very cute, but my 16 month old twins boys tip over very easily in it. They have both bumped their heads when the chair has tipped over on them. That said, they are only just learning how to sit properly and would much rather climb all over this chair. I think when they are a bit older the will be able to sit better and balance themselves. I really like that the slipcover unzips and comes off for easy cleaning. Other than the tipping aspect, I think this is a really cute and comfortable chair - not sure though if I will buy a second one so they can each have their own.",4
Down Under - Wood Shelf,"We got the accessories of this bedding set to decorate our son's room and it is just lovely.  The shelf itself is very secure and sturdy, it has his keepsake piggy bank and a picture on it, and holds the all of his coats!",5
"Mini Orchestra, Set of 4","I got this set for my child to play with and make sounds. She loved them right out of the box. 3 of the 4 make great sounds...the fourth one (which just has plates of plastic) doesn't make too much sound.  Compared to the other 3, it doesn't really do anything.  It's almost as if they ran out of ideas for the fourth one.  I do like that the they are Made in Israel (as opposed to China where everything seems to be made these days)",4
"Ju-Ju-Be B.F.F. Diaper Bag, Black/Silver",We love this bag.  Sis in law gave us one when our little one arrived.  Our friends envied the pockets and so many areas to put things!!!  We ordered for her!  Ju-Ju-Be is gonna be spread world wide with the AWESOME products and designs.,5
"Membranes for Medela Breastpumps, 16pc Value Pack, Suitable for Lactina, Swing, Pump in Style Pumps, Part # 87088",I ordered what is clearly listed as a 16 piece membrane kit (at the time that this is written) and was sent an 8 piece.  Amazon adjusted the price for me and will have the description changed.  Be wary until the description is changed.,1
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,This has been such a life saver for me!  At first I wasn't sure about it but I got the hang of using it and found that different formulas require different lengths of mixing.  Overall a great product and so much easier than mixing one bottle at a time.,5
"Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory",This was a nice pillow. It is thick and durable but I had to send it back because it was too long for my 5 foot frame.,3
Comfy Easy PC Play &amp; Learn Keyboard,"I have to say, the first time we played with this I thought it was going to be a dud and I was thinking I would send it back.  It's very simple and not much interaction to it.  But it turns out my 2 year old daughter loves it.  She gets a kick out of it and it's all she needs in a toy.(This is the Comfy PC and not the Elmo toy.)",4
"Bumkins Waterproof Superbib, Blue Fizz","The pocket catches everything. The fabric is easy to wash and durable. Air-dries fairly quickly compared to other bibs of this style that I've used. Occasionally I throw it in the washing machine instead of washing in the sink, and it holds up well (fabric doesn't become sticky or worn).",5
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,Thus cup is perfect for my 7 month old.  The handles are easy for him to grip and he's able to drink out of the straw on his own.  The fact that it is weighted is a great feature.,5
Hooded Towel (Teal),"I received this towel for my baby shower and washed it before use with the other hooded towels I received. I had a pregnant woman meltdown when I opened the washer and there was teal lint ALL OVER everything! Ruined my other towels and the teal towel was full of pulls, pills, and no longer as soft.I still use it now that my little one has arrived. It is nice and thick and a decent size but be warned if you purchase...wash by itself a few times before washing with other things.",2
"Rhino Toys, 6&quot; Oball Football, (Colors/Styles Vary)","My son was six months old when I go this for him, and he loved it.  It's much easier to pick up than other balls because he can fit his little fingers into the holes.  He also likes to squish it and chew on it.",5
Munchkin Bobble Bee Suction Toy,"My baby loves the toys. She likes all of the different sounds and motions the bee makes.I think the suction is awful. I can apply it to the high chair and within minutes, the suction is gone and it is moving all over the tray. I even tried applying it with water but that didn't help either.The bee does not stay in the holder, either which is good and bad. It is good because my baby can take it out to play with but bad because she can drop it in the floor.",3
25 mm One-Piece Breastshield w/ Valve and Membrane for Medela Breast Pumps; Set of 2; Made by Maymom,"I bought these as a replacement for the shields, valves and membranes for my 2004 model Pump in Style Advanced breast pump. They work just as well as the original parts. I have been very happy with them.",5
"HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Wearable Blanket, Cream, Medium",Soft and warm. Warm enough just to have my baby wear just a onesie underneath and gives her the room to move around. It is a great way to let them sleep with a blanket and not have a risk with suffocation. Runs true to size or a little big with lots of leg room,5
PottyCover - Disposable toilet seat covers. (6 individually packaged seat covers in each bag.),"I have not found one other seat cover that will cover the front AND sides of the toilet as well as these will...period.  My daughter ALWAYS grabs under the lip of the toilet seat to hang on as well as gripping the front of the toilet with her legs tucked under her...at home it isn't an issue because I keep her toilet super clean, but in public...YUCK!  We all know many adult women ""hover"" over the toilet when they use public facilities, often times causing them to ""sprinkle"" everywhere, including down the front of the bowl and all over the floor...DOUBLE YUCK!!  This is NOT what I want on the back of my baby girls pants and undies.Sure, they are not perfect...they take a while to open in a hurry and for some, I guess they apparently slip a little, but the alternative to NOT using them is some strangers urine on my little girls hands and clothes....a no-brainer for me.  I lift my daughter and place her on top of the seat and I don't have problems with slippage.  Perhaps a smaller opening or a cut out flap in the seat like the paper covers provided in public restrooms would help, could help keep it from sliding I guess. Until they make a design change though, I would use the paper seat cover provided by most facilities and lay one over the opening of this one...a little more work, but worth the peace of mind these covers provide.  As far as difficulty opening them, I open them and refold them at home so when I need it, it isn't such a challenge.I give them 4 stars because of the reasons I provided, but I am here to buy more, so I obviously like them.",4
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","When I was pregnant and shopping for the nursery, I was torn between what type of bumper to buy. One one hand I liked the softness of the Carter's brand bumper, but I liked the ""breathable"" bumper because my daughter was born in the beginning of summer and I wanted her to stay as cool as possible; so I bought the breathable bumper. When I put it on the crib, it looked very nice and while my daughter was little and imobile, it was very useful. As soon as she began to roll around, about 4 months, I would wake in the night to screams...her litttle arms and legs would get caught in the spacing of the crib, up and over the bumper! She would roll and turn while sleeping and apparently her limbs would lift over the bumper and the bumper would crumble under the light pressure of a babies arm. I have since bought the Carter's brand bumper and I am happy. It stands up to her limbs and no more limbs get caught. Great idea, but bumper needs work.",2
Munchkin: Fresh Food Feeder Colors vary,My baby absolutely loves this item but I think it's maybe for user friendly for the babies than it is for the parents. The things you put in it for the baby to eat are VERY hard to clean out of it when they're done.,3
Pearhead Baby Book Green,An absolutely beautiful baby book. My favorite part is the details on the pages and that it well constructed (not like other think books that can tear easily. I've actually ordered more as gifts and they are always a hit. I recommend this item highly.,5
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange",Great a stroller! I did a ton of research and decided on the City Mini GT. It has met every expectation. This is the perfect all around stroller. I highly recommend it.,5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Bath Center - Aquarium,"This tub is the worst infant tub I have ever used. When my daughter was a newborn the sling would keep her out of the water to where she would get cold easily. She also wasn't able to stay in the sling for more than a couple months because the tub has a plastic bar that would dig into her back. When I attempted to put her in the tub without the sling, leaning against the back of the tub, she would flop all over the place and the height of the lip of the tub came to just the right level for my three month old daughter to hit her head when she would try to sit up and then lay back again. I would not recommend this tub to anyone. It should be taken off the market. Don't waist your money.",1
The First Years Premium Single Electric Breast Pump,I bought this a s a gift for someone. They really appreciated it,5

Gerber 2 Pack Cotton Knit Fitted Crib Sheets Yellow/White Jungle Design,"These sheets are fine.  They are on the thin side, but with a mattress cover and sheet protector it's really not a big deal.  They are reasonably priced and meet my expectations.  I bought them to fit my 5&#34; Davinci Crescent Mini Crib 50 Coil Mattress (as suggested by another reviewer.)  Because they are fitted sheets they wrap snugly around the min crib mattress despite being measured for a regular sized crib mattress.  The sheets are sized for a regular mattress but the elastic keeps them snug enough to fit my mini mattress safely.",4
Beaba Babypote - Reusable Kids Squeeze Pouch,Too easy to squirt on the floor.  Which is exactly what my son did.  What I like is its easy to clean (relative to other squeeze tubes).,2
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I wasn't originally planning on using a bottle warmer...didn't think it was needed.  I was wrong! We were heating up tap water in a cup and placing the bottle in the cup to warm up...that took WAY TOO LONG!  I purchased this warmer because of it's size and the other online reviews I had read.  All you do is plug it in, fill the measuring cup to the desired level(you might have to do some trial and error here to get the right water amount) pour the water in and press the start button.  The great thing is it will automatically shut off when the heating process is finished.  I use Gerber bottles and it works well!  It works with ANY bottles though.  It's soooo easy to use!",4

Safety 1st High-Def Digital Video Monitor,"Ive been threw 3 video monitors and this one is by far the best one. The video has great quality, the sound works really good (no interference so far)the only bad thing is the screen is small, but worth having because it works so great. I love it! Great monitor and would recommend it to anyone. Don't waste your time on other monitors, try this one first:) oh and I am on my computer with the monitor on and I am not having any problems with wifi.",5
Boon Fluid -No-Spill Toddler Cup in Orange/Blue,"Yes, the lid is difficult to get off...but then again, the kid can't toss it on the floor and pop it off!!!  Peraps put a paper towel in your hand to protect your fingers while removing the lid...  It is great because it can't be unscrewed and dumped all over but a 23 month old!  I have had no leak issues either and my son has no problems getting liquid out of it!!!We really like the cup!!!And, it's BPA Free!!!",5
"BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Red","I have many of these for my two kids and I can not say enough about them. The first two I purchased nearly three years ago are just starting to wear out. They have been put in the dishwasher a minumum of once a day, every day. They catch almost all of the food that does not make it into my 2 year old and 10 month old's mouths. THEY ARE THE BEST!!",5
,"Sleepsacks rock in general, and this ""velboa"" or whatever material is the bomb. My son just loooooves this sleepsack because the material is so soft and cozy for cool nights. Once the sleepsack is on, my son lies there and kicks his legs in it and coos and smiles because he loves how it feels on his skin (we often put him in it wearing only a long-sleeved onesie, so his legs are touching the sleepsack). We have washed and dried it countless times and it is holding up great (though note that I generally use cold water and low dryer heat so maybe our stuff holds up better in general due to that).",5
"Safety 1st Splash Infant Bath Cushion, Blue","I purchased this to lay our newborn on in the infant bath tub. We used it for 5 months until he outgrew the tub and, therefore, stopped using this.  Through that time, it never molded or mildewed.  I like the temperature strip on the cushion and it was fairly accurate because we could gauge it against the actual floating toy thermometer we used as well.  The only thing I didn't like about the strip was that when I squeezed the sponge each night the strip started to get creases in it and then became hard to read.  It still read the temperature though even though it was bent in several locations.  You could be more careful to not squeeze this lower area like I did, or even roll it to prevent creasing the strip.",4
"Graco Contempo Highchair, Classic Pooh","This is a very functional highchair that has worked really well so far for my daughter. We visit my husband's grandparents regularly, and bringing this highchair along with us is so easy because of how small it becomes when folded.My only complaint is the fabric sides of the seat are floppy, and kind of hang in my daughter's lap when she sits in it. That doesn't seem to keep any stray food from escaping, but baby's are a messy business and I don't think any highchair can even remotely contain mess. The fact that it's so easy to clean pretty much negates this issue.My husband doesn't like that the tray rips his arm hair clean off when the insert is in place, but he simply takes it off if he's going to be the one to feed our daughter. The tray itself is easy to clean by hand.",4
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White",I ordered this with fingers crossed... and was so happy when it arrived and I saw it is taller than the standard 11 inch bumper. The manufacturer should list the measurements somewhere in the post... this product is worth the few extra dollars to avoid injury with slatted cribs. It is easy to install however it does slip down so I used some double sided tape (easily removed with goo-gone when I remove the bumper in a few months) at each corner to to keep it in place. The color is a brighter pink. The material is soft. My daughter hasn't gotten her leg stuck once since I installed this product! Thanks!,4
"Star Kids Play 'N Go Travel Tray, Green","We flew with our infant regularly, so I needed product(s) that would be compact and keep her entertained on the plane. Maybe it was just my daughter but she was not a fan...the zipper was fun...the clip was a little too much for her (and still is at 15 months)...it just did not seem like each little item was collectively age appropriate. My daughter could do the zipper at 8 months no problem and pull of all the little pieces...she could not do a button though or the clip...well now she is 15 months and can do the button with ease, not the clip and has no interest in the other pieces because she essentially outgrew them. The mirror is completely fuzzy and was since we purchased it, light does not even reflect from it very well. Not worth the price...there are so many better toys out there for travel!",2
The First Years Disney Pooh Soft Potty Seat,This seat is much better than the Dora seat we had previously (and donated to our daycare so our daughter would go there as well).  The Dora seat seemed to get dirty easily between the cushion and the handle piece and it had a &#34;splash guard&#34; that made getting on and off or having them bed over to wipe a pain - sometime literally.  This seat is great and has none of the issues we noted with our previous seat.,5
Child Airplane Travel Harness - Cares Safety Restraint System - The Only FAA Approved Child Flying Safety Device,"Our one-year-old is just too small to understand what is going on and struggles to free herself from this.  It's not really too large for her physically, but I think it works better for older kids.",4
BRICA Stay-On Window Shade,"I bought this shade because it looked cute, easy, and had pretty good reviews.  However, I couldn't, for the LIFE of me, get the thing to stick to my backseat window.  I cleaned the window, allowed ample time for the window to dry, followed the directions to a ""T"" and nope...won't stick.  Had my husband try as well, same story.Returned this shade and got the Brica Stretch-to-Fit Sun Shade and it took about 10 seconds to install and it covers a larger area of the window.  Love theBRICA Stretch-to-Fit ====> GOODBRICA Stay-On === > BAD",5
"babyletto Bowery Bassinet, Espresso","I bought this product becuase I loved the way it looked (color, style, size) and liked the idea of using it as a toy box after the baby outgrew it. Well I am very tall and so is my baby (was 21&#34;at birth) so this product I feel could have been a bit larger. You also have to put many pieces together to build it. One person can put it together but it is better suited for a two persons to help. The wood seems sturdy and it really looks nice but my baby's arms would get stuck in between the bars each time I put her in. She never slept one night in it. I gave it 3 stars because i do like the way it looks but practically with regard to usage and price (paid $100) it's not worth it.",3

Gund Baby 24&quot; Comfycozy Pippy Monkey Blanket,"it's a very soft blanket. it has silk on the bottom, which i don't really like because it slides around and doesn't stay where you put it. it's a good size for my baby and good for him to cuddle with when he gets older. overall i like it, it gets used everyday. glad it's washable. i've washed it and it came out like new. will be using this comfycozy blanket for a long time.",5

"Sassy Rattlin Rings, Blue/Black","Okay, so my son is 3 months old.  He doesn't &#34;play&#34; very much yet, even thought we own about a million baby toys.  This rattle, though, is perfect for him.  The colors call his attention, and he can grasp it no problem.  It goes right to his mouth once he grabs it, and he loves to gnaw on the polka-dotted ball.  I would not pay over $5 for this toy (it is pretty simple), but for a couple of bucks it is great.",4
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","Is perfect for my baby, the remote control is so usefull also when you are far form him, and the proyection on the roof is clear and perfect",5
Baby Fanatic University of Florida Light Switch Cover,We just redid our child's bedroom in a Gator's theme; this switch plate really finished it off nicely.  Go Gators!,5
Summer Infant Little Looster,"I bought this thinking I had finally found a step stool that my daughter would feel secure climbing. I was disappointed. The idea of it is fantastic, but the execution of the construction is not. Because it's a little on the thin side and hollow it wobbles slightly when standing on it. You wont fall off but my daughter doesn't feel secure because it is not a solid step. We still use ours because it was still the best and biggest one I found. But I wouldn't buy it again. If they can find a way to make it more solid it would be awesome.",3
Two Tone U Zip Backpack in Denier,"I purchased this backpack diaper bag when my daughter was 3 weeks old, she is 6 mo. now and we have really gotten great use out of this bag.  Having a backpack means I can tote everything and keep my hands free for taking care of the baby.  It's a classic black, not frilly or too utilitarian looking - it's a nice compromise.  My husband doesn't mind carrying it and neither do I!  It's well balanced and has padded straps, so it's comfortable when you need to carry it on long walking days - like touring Washington D.C. or spending a day on walking trails in a national park.  It balances very nicely to have the diaper bag on my back and the baby in the front carrier.  It's been great for travel by plane or car and wonderful for an entire day ""out"".The bag can hold quite a bit.  I'm not sure that I've ever filled it really.  In the main compartment I often put 1-2 outfits, 3-5 diapers, wipes, changing pad(it came with one), 2 baby books, a rattle, a teddy bear, a receiving blanket, a bib and a burp cloth and there is still room left even if I add the digital camera and its battery and card case.  If I don't take the bear I can put my small purse in the top so all my stuff is together and easily removed instead of spread out in the diaper bag's pockets.  There is a plastic dirty duds bag attatched to the inside and there are 3 mesh pockets on the inside.  They are intended for bottles, but I use them to hold medicine, nail clippers, lotion, sunblock and anything else that is either small and easily lost or needs to remain upright.  I just stick her bottle in the main compartment and let it fend for itself since I don't mix it until she's ready to eat.  There is an elastic pocket on each side of the bag that will hold a bottle or a sizeable water bottle (I stick my Nalgene bottle in there)or any number of other things.  Someitmes I put my cell phone and 2-3 pacifiers and a pen and keys in one of the side pockets.  There is a zipper compartment on the lid that I use for my checkbook, calendar, ID, mints, chapstick and trial size hand lotion.  The front pocket velcros shut and is thinner.  I just keep some important paperwork folded up inside.Now that we don't go through outfits as fast, I'm trying to move to a smaller bag for normal errand running trips.  My husband doesn't want to give up this bag, even for short trips!  There is no doubt that we'll be keeping this bag accessible for any day trips, travel or overnighters!If I could change something about this bag, I would make the front pocket more useable.  I would like to be able to keep my keys and phone there and have organized pockets built in for credit cards, ID and a pen.  Also, the main compartment can seem somewhat cavernous when you're looking for a cereal bar that has migrated to the bottom.  It might be nice to have it divided, but I'm not actually positive I would prefer that - it's just a thought.I would highly reccomend this bag for new parents, parents of messies or anyone else who needs room for more than the bottle, 2 diapers, changing pad and wipes that are all some bags can hold.",5
SoftBums Echo Set with 3 new style one-size SUPER Dry Touch Pods (Coconut),"I would get the bamboo  pods rather than the stay dry.It is so easy when your  baby just pees, quick switch of the pod and you are done!We now have many different shells that are cute and fun.",5
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","pretty good design.. i'd have to say i prefer pocket diapers, because when my baby poops in these, it's on the cover AND my prefold, but am still satisfied with these.. i recommend alva baby pockets for anyone on a budget, though",3

Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Deluxe Musical Mobile Gym,"We had the jumper from this collection for my first son, and got this for my second son when I realized that he loves the mobile in his crib. I needed something for the living room where he could lounge with us while doing activities with my older son. He loves this mat, it super easy to take off and wash, there are so many things for him to look at, and it's bright and colorful. We also got the portable swing from this set as a gift and he loves it! Anything that makes a newborn happy is five stars in my book!!",5

BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This is the only potty chair you will ever want or need!  My two children (ages 3 and 2) loved their chairs and were potty trained in no time using the Baby Bjorn potty chairs.  I previously purchased one that played songs when they went potty, but I quickly found it was very difficult to clean and to move around the house (too many parts). I loved the fact that is was so very easy to clean - no cracks or grooves or lids to worry about!  And I loved the portability of the chair.  It is lightweight and easy to move around the house (I would use it in the children's playroom when they could not make it to the bathroom). The Baby Bjorn could easily be used in your vehicle as well. Great simple design and very comfortable for the children to use as well.  Two thumbs up!",5
"Trend Lab 2 Piece Dr. Seuss Frame Set, ABC",These were bigger than I expected but still worked in the space I had in mind. There were a few little scuff marks on both frames but not noticeable enough for me to send back.,3
"Combi Cocorro Lightweight Convertible Car Seat, Chestnut","We purchased this car seat for my (now 10 months old) son to ride rear facing in the back of my nanny's 1999 Toyota Corola with two other kids (3 year olds, forward facing, Britax and diono r100).  I love it, and if I had it to do over, I would not have bothered with a bucket seat.  It is a bit tricky to install rear facing- I needed a rolled up towel and the seat belt works a bit better in the Corola than the latch system.  But- it is super light and easy to transfer between vehicles, the fabric stays cool, it seems very comfortable- he falls asleep easily in it, it fits perfectly in a sedan such that three across is easy, and the straps are easy to work with and comfortable.  Once it was installed correctly, it seemed very solid and sturdy in the car. We went on a family trip recently and took this and the Diono, and there was so much more space in the car (Honda Civic) than there normally is with the bigger car seats.  Even though we did not carry much stuff in the extra space, it just felt more comfortable to not be all crammed in there.  My son is small- about 20 pounds at 10 months, and I can see him using this seat for a good long time.  Having these two car seats made me feel like I did not have to upgrade to a bigger car.  We may someday consider a more fuel efficient vehicle (a Prius or Insight), but with these seats, I feel like I can stay in my civic for years to come.",5

DEX Products Electric Baby Food Processor,"I like this little processor for mixing up small quantities of food.  True, it doesn't hold a ton, but I does what I bought it for - I make a few days worth at a time.-  Holds about 8 oz of food comfortably at a time (so it mixes well, etc)-  I think this is a good size to make fresh food and to try new foods (without making a bunch if it's not a hit!)-  Pretty easy to clean-  Just 4 parts, so easy to assemble and use-  It's not super heavy duty, so I do chop things up a good amount before putting them in thereAll in all, I think it's worth it.  I didn't have a regular food processor and for me a blender just didn't work quite right and I thought it was harder to get the food mixed.Some hints I also found when investigating making baby food are:-  After mixing if you want to freeze any, just use ice cube trays.  Each cube is about 1 oz and once they're frozen, pop them out and put in a zip-loc for storage.-  If you're just getting started, I thought this website was useful and had good ideas - -  wholesomebabyfoodGood luck!",5
Cheeky Monkey Pac Back,I used this on my recent trip from Alaska to New Zealand.  The pack was extremely helpful in navigating through the airport as well as boarding the plane.,5
UPPAbaby Easy Fit Car and SUV Shade,"After trying several products, I purchased the UPPAbaby Easyfit Shade thinking this will be my last attempt. It's a great product and the suctions work well, but the size is too big for my car (VW CC) - that's why I'm giving 4 stars not 5. I wish they make different sizes for smaller windows. My car window is low and wide, so what ended up happening is the shade fabric folded and overlapped so my baby can't see outside anymore. I think it will work great in my husband's car, but we already got the UpShadeUpShade - Car or Truck Rear Side Window Shade - Small Rear Size - 1 Pairfor it and it looks great so we won't switch (UpShade doesn't work on VW CC either because there's no window frame on top).",4

"Sassy Baby Food Nurser, Colors May Vary","As a mother of 6 month old twins, I need products that work as designed.  While these bottles do allow the cereal to easily pass through the nipple they are VERY DIFFICULT to put together.  The colored pieces (top & bottom) do not fit the clear bottle well at all and require several minutes to put together every time I use them.  My husband wants me to throw them away but unfortunately I've not been able to find a competing product to replace them with.  I actually dread using these....",2

"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","I like this stroller because of the weight limit is nice and it's not cheaply made or flimsy like the ones you can buy anywhere for 12 bucks. This is a nice sturdy stroller. My daughter is petite but she likes it, doesn't complain like she does in her big E. B. stroller. The only down fall so are is the sunshade, it's not very big, but it's not a deal breaker. The basket on the bottom is nice to have also, it's not large but it can fit a baby carrier, a small bag and maybe a small purse. I also like the small pockets by the handles. It has a closed pocket, and 1 large and 2 small small pockets. This is great for snacks and sippy cups. I'm 5'1 and feel that the handles are a little high up for me, but my husband feels comfy pushing it. It's nice a light weight, which is another plus when you have to put it in your car. This is great!",5

"Obersee Kid's All-in-One Pre-School Backpacks with Integrated Cooler, Rhinestone Angel Wings",I bought this for my child because there are no appropriate sized backpacks for children 5 to 7 years old.  This backpack is designed just for that age group and fits her just right.  I am able to put her lunch box inside or use the insulated portion to store cold items.  It is very durable and is holding up to everyday use very well.  When this one wears out I will defiantly return and purchase a new one from them.  The item arrived at my door step appropriately packed and on time.,5
Neat Solutions 10-count Winnie the Pooh Tidy Topper Disposable Changing Pads,"Firstly, I was using the sassy disposable changing pad, but for some reason, i could not get them anymore and i rush to amazon to get all the neat solution pad they have, which was really cheap and worth every penny I change the changing pad at every changing since my baby was born and I plan to that till he is 6 month. Not to defiate, I saw this one ....and it was bigger than the sassy and very good as well but it only 10 for 2.99...the sassy is 3.99 for 36...but is is really big so i cut all prior to changing pad.....",4

Cosco Scenera Convertible Car Seat Black,"This is an awesome deal on a safe car seat. I did a lot of research on safe car seats and how to properly install them. This one did take my husband a little longer to install than we anticipated, but I feel like my daughter is safe (it is rear-facing at the moment). But she is comfortable in it and my husband and I can easily get her in and out. I did get a seat that is a little more plush for my car (which she rides in much more often), but for the price this is a deal for our 2nd vehicle! Both sets of grandparents have ordered this as well.",5

"Trumpette Howdy Bouncy Rubber Cow, White",I ordered this for my 2 yr old grandaughter but she was unable to hop on it.  However my 4 yr old grandaughter took to it right away and became very attached to it!!!!  Needless to say it went home to live with her for awhile :).  We kept her name to trumpette. She is almost 5 now and still plays and talks to it.  They are great friends!,5

Manhattan Toy Big Tops Sounds,"This toy is adorable and I think it is an excellent learning tool.  The animals are sweet and the voice that states each ones name is appealingly young. However, the door never stays open which is frustrating for myself and my one year old. The on/off switch is unnecessarily hidden. Then, it suddenly stopped working after about a month of play. New batteries were put in and I got one more monkey sound, then it died again. So disappointing!",1
Trunki - Trixie Pink,"We got this a week before vacation and our 5 yr old daughter is estatic about it.She has been playing with it all day riding it, pulling her stuffed animals on it, packing it with her toys. I thought it may be too young for her but I was wrong. She is soo happy to have her own little cute suitcase she can pull along since she always tries to help us pull luggage around on past vacations but was a struggle with them being too tall or too heavy. Now she is proud and also can't wait to be pulled around on it at the hotels. LOL.It is a little small for her riding size. she has to really pick up her feet legs and she is a average sized 5 yr old. But it holds up her weight just fine. I caught her sitting sideways on it with all her weight and tipping it onto the sides of the wheels on the side and I cringed thinking she was going to snap the plastic wheels but they did not budge so I am impressed.Now she has packed up clothing and toys and thinks she is ready to go and plans on keeping it packed until it's time to go in a week LOLWell made but I think the wheels could be made of a stronger thicker plastic like the rest of the suitcase. I like how the sides lock easily. She can also unlock it herself without much trouble at all. The pull strap also attaches to both top ends so you could carry it if you would like. That strap also has little plastic keys on both ends that fit into the locks on the sides. You do not have to take the strap off to use the key. The keys are on a strap of their own that is jsut long enough to reach the locks. Great idea. Though I am not yet sure why the keys just yet as The locks slide up and down to lock them in place. Perhaps they are made for the parents to fully lock the locks so the child cannot push them open on their own as I attmpted to use one of the locks very quickly but was not able to turn the lock in any way but it was only for a second and I did not really try to turn it. I will have to check it out later.You can also but sticker and a saddle for these. But I think the sticker should just come with the suitcase with the price you pay for it. Not that that price is outrageous. I Think it is priced ok for how much the child loves it, the ability to have the child ride on it to make it easy for the parents with hands full of bags.Overall I really like it.",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Breastcare Essentials Set,As a first time breast feeder I was excited to order this little kit. It had everything you needed to start out with and very helpful booklet and feeding log to keep track of feedings for those first few weeks when everything is a blur!,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"We have actually purchased two of these potty chairs because we were so pleased with the product.  Our son seems to actually enjoy going to use the potty when we started training him.  Early on, it was very difficult and we tried using a step stool and one of the seats that fits on the toilet but that didn't work well.  After purchasing this, things started going much smoother.  Overall, a great product and I would highly recommend it to parents trying to potty train their kids.  And it is easy cleanup as well.",5
"Cardinal Gates Stairway Special Gate, Black",I love these gates and would recommend them to anyone with toddler's who can figure things out easily.  My daughter was two when I purchased them and it kept her away from the stairs and out of harms way.  I also loved how easy they were to install.  I installed them on my own with no problems.,5
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,I love this cover. It is the perfect weight and thickness. I would recommend this to any of my friends.,5
Alva Baby Double Rows of Snaps 6pcs Pack Fitted Pocket Washable Adjustable Cloth Diaper with 2 Inserts Each (6 Assorted Neutral Color),"I find many deals on Amazon but these I ordered on the Alva Baby website, way cheaper.  Even though it comes from China took about a week as my order cost enough to get their free express shipping.These diapers are great, absorbent, and should last us the whole time we're in diapers.  Probably the best diaper for the price.If you're lucky enough to have a baby that sleeps through the night you may do like me and use a disposable diaper just for night time as we've ended up damp in the morning with these.  No problems so far throughout the day though.  I think I could double pads up and avoid the problem, but our Snuza clips to the disposable diaper better, which our baby wears at night.I wash mine with Ecos laundry detergent and throw them in the dryer on delicate setting, no dryer sheets.These are cute enough I can put baby in a tshirt and have diaper on bottom and makes a cute enough outfit for summer months.",5
Summer Infant Newborn-To-Toddler Bath Center &amp; Shower,"Contrary to what others say...I love this tub for my newborn! I haven't even used the sprayer yet, but I will try it soon. I've used the sling chair & tub maybe 20 times. I think they are great!!! No problems here!!",5
"NUK Replacement Silicone Spout, Clear",My son liked to chew his spouts to make the hole bigger.  We were unable to find replacements at the local stores but were fortunate to find them on Amazon.  The product fits perfectly since it is a manufacturer product.  It also helps save money from having to buy a whole new cup when all we needed is the nipple.,5
"Tiny Love 3 in 1 Rocker Napper, Brown","I got this as a gift for my first baby. It is good in concept (3-in-1) but does not do everything it promises to do. First of all, this Rocker Napper does NOT rock at all. Second, in addition to the troublesome battery installation, this product disappointed me as its vibration mode and music play did not work. Also, the assembly was not that easy (quite complicated with many small parts), so I am baffled at what other reviewers are saying about the easy assembly and all.It now is just a cute-looking napper, and I hope we will be able to use it as a chair later on. Overall, quite disappointed and would not recommend to my friends.",2
"Evenflo Amp Performance No Back Booster Car Seat, Orange","My husband and I bought this for our 4 year old son and he loves it.  It's comfortable, allows him to see out the window and he loves that there are two drink holders so he can have his drink and snack with him.  It goes in and out of the car easily so he can go with other people with no hassle.  We love this seat.  Haven't had to clean it yet so we can't give a review on that.",5

KidCo Spring Action Cabinet Lock 4-pack,"Our cats have decided that climbing into our cupboards and exploring everything within would be the best past-time ever. The problem for us was that some of these cabinets are rather deep, and cavernous.These latches were easy to install, and have successfully kept our cats out of the cupboards ever since I put them in.My only suggestion is to make sure you use the screws efficiently. There are more screw-holes in the latches and hooks than there are actual screws. Be careful not to run out of screws before you've installed all the latches.",4
Baby Einstein Discovery Drums,I lay my baby underneath a baby mirror and put the discovery drums right next to her. She will hit the drums with her hand and watch them light up in the mirror. She loves it. I can tell she is intentionally hitting the drums so she can see the lights and hear the music. She will do this for a good 45 minutes. It gives me time to do dishes and laundry.,5

They are just big stickers though so be careful getting them off their sheet because they will tear.,4

"Angelcare Baby Sound Monitor, White","The unit we used before this was a Philips Avent, which worked great until the battery died out and it had to be on the charger the whole time it was on, or it would turn off immediately.The Angelcare baby monitor has great battery life for one key reason: the base only transmits sound to the receiver when there is a noise by the base that breaches the sensitivity threshold set by the user.  So, this leads to extraordinary battery life, but the tradeoff is that you don't hear every sound that is happening in the baby's room.  Even with the sensitivity turned up all the way, I had to resort to placing the base unit in the bassinet with our newborn for the base to transmit to the parent unit when baby starts crying.  Several times the unit has only responded after the crying, so i only catch the end of the cry.  Once again, this might be OK for some, but for me, it is annoying, at best.The sound quality is OK... it's not as good as the Avent unit we have, the sound is sometimes muffled, and I can't make out my wife's voice very clearly when she's talking to baby.  With the Avent it is crystal clear.  Then again, the Avent cost twice as much.The thermometer appears to be accurate and reliable.  I also found the nightlight to be nice, although we have not used it.  It's still a nice feature to include.  On that same note, I don't like the bright green LED on the front of the base unit; when it is on, it is BRIGHT.  I'm covering it up with a small piece of black electrical tape to block out the light.",3
Bellybuds&reg; | Baby-Bump Sound System,Although I've read playing music doesn't make him smarter I've also read it can make him more comfortable with noisy rooms. He seems to really enjoy fat tempo music,4
Paci Plushies Paisley The Panda Pacifier,"Absolutely the best stuffed animal holder out there. While we started off with wubanubs, our little one (at 3 months) wanted firmer pacifiers. I actually discovered paci plushies through an online ad, ordered a couple and they work great. They easily fit soothies (if you follow the directions) which is done by putting the tab through where attachment meets the stuffed animal. For other pacifiers you use the loop part. WIth a little ingenuity (by threading the loop through a hole) you can even get it to fit unsupported pacifiers such as the first years gum drop ones (they are like soothies but have a cut out to fit the babbies nose better.Anyways, its great that these fit any pacifier and that you can simply remove the pacifier to sterilize it. Also, if you want a better price buy direct from the manufactorer. They often have 50% coupons you can find by googling ""paci plushie coupon code."" This brings the price down to 7 bucks each which is well worth it.",5
"Baby Bottle Labels, Self-laminating - Great for Daycare",These are cute and serve their purpose.  My only complaint is that after you start washing whatever you stick them on the label is no longer flush against any curved surface.  On flat surfaces they stick perfectly.,4
BRICA Corner Bath Basket Toy Organizer,This is a great product.  I purchased a different toy basket from Baby's R Us and it did not hold up.  The suction cups would not stick to the tile and it did not hold a lot of our larger toys.  This one is well built and can hold a large number of bath toys.  I put the basket up high so that my daughter would stand up in the tub to get her toys out.  The suction cups are great and we have not had any issues with them slipping or coming off the tile in our bathroom.  I highly recommend this toy basket!,5
"Ju-Ju-Be Be All Diaper Bag, Lotus Lullaby","I bought this diaper bag before my son was born because as a college student I always used a messenger bag and I thought this would be the perfect diaper bag. My son is now 4 1/2 months old and the bag is still very useful. The reason I bought the Ju Ju Be bag was because of all the features, the best one being the magnetic closures.  I don't have to worry about making a lot of noise since it does not have velcro closures. I was also sold by the insulated bottle pockets, but soon realized that I had no need for them. The ""mommy pocket"" is nice to have, but if you put too many things in there, the bag ends up looking bulky and the flap becomes heavy.  I can fit a lot of things in the bag and can hang it over my stroller, which is great because it tends to get heavy. I considered getting the stroller clips, but it turned out that I didn't need them for my stroller. One complaint is that the changing pad is small so I had to use one from a different diaper bag that I have.  Overall, I've been pretty happy with the bag, although sometimes I miss having a purse.",4
dreamgenii Pregnancy Body Support and Feeding Pillow (UPDATED),"I bought this pillow for her last year and didn't live up to her expectation. Gave her more back pain and was uncomfortable to sleep on. The back support cushion is too small. The leg and bump support are about the same size cushion...Overall it's poorly made. It's better to buy a regular pillow, or a body pillow.",2
Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker,"This product is simply amazing. Steams fruits and veggies perfectly and the food processor is phenomenal. Very easy to use and even easier to clean. I truly enjoy making my baby's food. One tip I have found is to remove the water left after steaming into a glass cup and slowly add it back to the bowl while processing. The lid must be on to blend the food, so it will take you a few times to remove the lid to add the water; however, you can control the consistency of the food this way. Mommy and baby are really happy with this purchase. :)",5
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Extra Tall Walk-Thru",While I love the appearance of the gate alot of the plastic hardware came broken or is now breaking so it will have to be replace at $14.99.  I would have preferred metal hardware.,3
Fisher-Price 900 MHZ Long-Range Monitor with Dual Receivers,"I've noticed the other review that says the reception is crystal clear and the vibration setting is great.  I have no idea why, but it doesn't work for me.  I've tried both channels and both have a loud static all the time.  The vibration setting does not work at all.  I wish it did work!  But maybe it's something about my home (home wifi network or cordless telephones?)  I don't know.  But please don't assume it will work for you, apparently it works for some people but not for others.",2
MOBI MobiCam Ultra 900 MHz Monitoring System with SW Power,"This is my first review ever.  I just had to write because I was so disappointed with this product.  The first day we got it, we were very pleased with the sensitive audio and nice day and night video.  The second day it broke.  I thought it was just a fluke, so we exchanged it - our second unit lasted less than a day before the audio stopped working.  I can't believe we had 2 broken units in 2 days!  For this price, you'd expect better quality than that.",2
Medela Swing Breastpump,"nao recebi o produto ainda,estou decepcionado com a amazon.com, pois foi minha primeira compra.o produto ja esta atrasado em uma semana",5
Potty Time Potty Watch - Blue,"Functionally, there is nothing wrong with this watch.  I bought this for my 5 yr old who is in Kindergarten and has regressed in potty training since starting school.  I wanted to try a watch for him but didn't want to spend $40 or more on one of the other alarm watches without knowing whether he would use it or not so I thought this would be a good trial watch for the price.  With that being said here is what I wish I knew before purchasing...1.  From the picture I didn't realize it but the watch face is shaped like a toilet.  Not sure how I didn't see that but it's kinda cheesy.2.  Wish I had known the songs/tunes it played.  I was thinking it would chime or beep but it plays &#34;Oh My Darling&#34; and &#34;London Bridges&#34; and one other song.  Cute for a 2 yr old but not so much for 3 or older.3.  You can set the alarm to alert every 30, 60 or 90 minutes which was a good feature but it still would have been nice to know before hand.4.  Does not keep time at all - only counts down.  So, if you think it would serve a dual purpose of potty training and helping learn time you should know that it won't.All in all my son wore it for 1 1/2 days.  It served it's purpose for reminding him to use the bathroom BUT one day wearing it at school brought him home sad because the kids laughed and made fun of him because of the songs and how it looked.  Good intentions by mom went bad.  So, I have ended up buying the more expensive alert watch anyway.All of this is to say that it would probably be okay for kids under 3 yrs old who are just learning but even then be aware that the watch is not waterproof and it does not velcro (it buckles) so it will be hard for them to get on and off for hand washing and bath time.",3
"Jeep Overland Limited Jogging Stroller with Front Fixed Wheel, Fierce",Great jogging stroller! Great price! Easy to assemble and fold up. Very impressed with the construction quality and the quality overall!,5
"John Deere Coated Bib, Toddler Boy",I've been searching for some time now for a bib that can stand up to my messy twin boys and this is it.  It wipes off easily with a washcloth and have withstood the washing machine every couple days.  It has strings that tie at the back instead of velcro (which so many other bibs have) which my boys immediately pull off - plus the velcro ruins everything else in the washer.  And the neckline is high so it actually catches drips and crumbs.  Highly recommend!,5
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,Bought these as a gift for my daughter and couldn't be happpier.  Nice bright cololrs and soft makes it child friendly.,5
"Stork Craft Tuscany Glider and Ottoman, Cherry/Beige","At first it was squeaky but then my baby and I broke into it. It no longer makes noise like the first 2 months. You can always at WD40 to stop the squeakiness. I always forgot to but eventually it went away. Now the question is, how do I clean it?",4
"OXO Tot Mini Silicone Dishwasher Basket, Orange","It is great for small parts that falls out of the regular basket. And if you have only 2-3 nipples for one load, this saves tone of space in the dishwasher than the regular basket.",5
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Infant to Toddler Rocker, Alpha Fun","Still using it for the third child, and out of 6 rockers we have owned, this is the winner. all others have ripped, frayed, or are too flimsy to use when the kids are older. Sold or gave away the others, and still holding on to this one. good buy, instead of goodbye.",5
Travel Potty Chair,"What a great product.  Having two small kids and being on the road most of the time, I find this potty to be a real life saver (so to say).  Plastic bags are always available everywhere, the size of the unit is pretty convenient and not once have I had any leaks, even when I've had it for almost two years now.  It is durable and easy to clean.  Do not even hesitate, if you need to drive long distances, buy this potty, you won't be dissapointed.",5
"OXO Tot Bowl Set, Green",I ordered this along with the OXO Tot spoon set to feed my son his first solid purees that I make at home. The small bowl is perfect size and it is easy to scoop the food out.  I actually purchased another set locally today.,5
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White",I bought this sound system for my littler baby  and  the sound was great! The image that project onto the ceiling was beautiful. Recommended!,5
"Regalo My Chair Portable Chair, Royal","I bought two chairs for my 21 month old twins ( 20 and 27 lbs). Seemed like a great way to travel and bring along our own high chairs. All was great until you realize the center strap can not be adjusted! Even worse its only about two and a half inches long, so it sits uncomfortably low and between their legs,leaving marks. It also can't be used without the center strap. I'm hoping to make my own modification so they can be used. Otherwise they're useless.",2
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,Our little one loves this jumper. The pics of babies sleeping in it are a little worrisome... I hope people don't get the idea that this jumper is for putting baby in and leaving him or her there until they fall asleep. There is no way a baby's posture is supported for sleep in this thing. It is WONDERFUL for when baby has energy to burn but can't walk or crawl yet.,5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","So cute, lots to do on it so he doesn't get board quickly. But most of all the isntallation is super simple and it can be moved to multiple items such as the bouce seat, care seat or even over the play pen.",5
"Graco DuoGlider Classic Connect Stroller, Dragonfly",Extremely pleased with the ease of assembly.  The stroller is very sturdy & easy to use.I have a Daycare & use this often Iwould recommend to anyone!,5
Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump,"Bought this when I traveled for Christmas, as I couldn't lug my electric pump with me, and it was and still is perfect for my pumping needs. I only pump about 4 bottles weekly so the electric pump seems too much maneuvering for such a small amount. This hand held pump has been exactly what I've needed and I continue to use it. Gets the job done and its very simple and straight forward. I highly recommend it!",5
"Prince Lionheart BoosterPOD, White Base/Lemon","I bought two for my twin babies, they are soft, easy to clean, easy to assemble to the chair... love it",5
"Britax Marathon 70 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","I did so much research for a convertible car seat for my daughter, and decided to buy Britax Marathon 70 - Jet Set based on the good reviews on Amazon and BabiesRUS.  However, a week after I purchased the car seat, I found articles online on cbs news and usatoday that Britax Marathon 70 - Jet Set is one of the most toxic car seats, and more disappointly the other most toxic car seat also from Britax.I want the best for my baby, and I think that is most parents like to do.  I don't usually write reviews, but I think this information is very important and all parents should be informed.",1

The First Years American Red Cross Soothing Baby Scale,"Would not turn on!  Tried other new batteries, removed and replaced them several times.  It just did not work!  [...]It also comes with a RED CROSS on it, not shown in photo.  I bought this to use as a small pet scale.  [...]",1
Elegant Baby Plush Microfiber Blankie - Pastel Blue,"It is my fault for not reading the dimension size of the blanket; if I would have, I wouldn't have bought it! Too small! It's very deceiving from the picture, it looks like it's going to be an average size baby blanket, but, it's not even an average size doll blanket. My husband and I had a good laugh though.",2
Kidsme Food Feeder 'All you need for feeding' Set,"I like the set and all the contents. I was a little disappointed in the foodmill itself. It looked as if it had the metal grinding mill, but it came with a plastic one. It just didn't seem to mash the food very well.",3
Diaper Dude Messenger II Diaper Bag in Black Pinstripe,"I got this as a gift, so I have not seen it in action.  But I was pleased with the look of it and I hope it will encourage my brother to do his fair share without the excuse of not wanting to carry a floral diaper bag.",4
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink",This solved a problem we had. What to send to school for lunch. Soup stays piping hot with no leaks and my 16 year old isn't ashamed by the sleek design of the product way to go. She takes it to school often .Others have asked her where to get one.at 16 they are all about looks and this product doesn't fall short on looks or performance.,5
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce","I wish I had discovered these years ago. We've gone through so many plastic bottles and sippy cups that, in addition to possibly leaching chemicals into the kids' drinks, have leaked, cracked, or grown mold inside the straw because they were so poorly designed and/or difficult to clean. After discovering this Thermos Foogo, I feel like we have finally found ""the one""! Our toddler can use these cups without spilling (you can *make* it leak a little if the lid is open and you shake it upside down, but since the point of a straw cup is to hold it upright while drinking she doesn't ever spill it). With the lid closed they don't leak at all. They actually do keep drinks cold, so I don't worry about putting milk in them. To my surprise, when we bought one for our toddler, our six year old loved it too, so now she takes one to school every day. Our toddler takes two to her daycare once a week and the teachers seem happy with them. (I stocked up after finding them on sale at a baby store.) After constant use for the last few months, they are holding up very well. I would definitely recommend these!",5
"Graco LiteRider Classic Connect Stroller, Pasadena",Complete junk. Folds with the tray at the base causing scratches and dirt to be an issue. Also folding and unfolding gets stuck most of the time. Would not recommend.,1

Baby Einstein Bendy Ball,"Our baby loves it, but it is a little harder than I thought it would be.  It's also quite a bit smaller than I thought, but it is a good size for his little hands.",4
Lunette Clear Menstrual Cup with Feelbetter Liquid Wash 8.5oz - Model 1,"I have been using the Diva Cup for a couple of months, I ordered the Lunette Selene Cup......WOW, WOW, WOW.Its firmer, doesn't leak and the flat tip is easier to remove than the round Diva Cup.  I'm ordering another Lunette to replace the Diva Cup and use the diva for backup only.",5
3 Pack Snack Trap (colors may vary),"I was a little skeptical about these when I bought them, but after another day of picking up dozens of goldfish crackers that my son shook out of his bowl causing flying goldfish to land nearly everywhere in the kitchen, I decided to give these a try.  My son didn't like the lid at first, it took him some time to reach in there willingly, but hunger won out over the strange feeling on his hands.  Now we use them all the time.  They don't prevent spilling altogether, but now instead of dozens of goldfish, I'm only picking up a handful.  I'll recommend these to anyone who's child likes to shake whatever dish they're using at the time!",5
"Alva Baby Adjustable Reuseable Pocket Cloth Diaper Nappy + 2 Inserts ,Leaves YZ01","These are my least favorite cloth diapers. They seem to leak for some reason (maybe it's just my kid, who knows). If you're looking for a better quality but still very inexpensive pocket diaper, I suggest Sunbaby.",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter is 4 months old and will not take a pacifier.  My neighbor got one for her son and told me about it.  I figured I'd try it out.  I also bought one for my nephew, who also won't take a pacifier.  Both babies love her!  She is easy for them to hold and to get into their mouths.  My daughter really loves chewing the feet!  I tell everyone about Sofie!  One of the best toys so far!!",5
"Graco Vie 4 Stroller, Inman Park","This stroller was the only one we ever really looked at. After other reviews here and help from my mother, who is a consumer reports junkie and saw that it received a very good there, we ordered the stroller. It is fantastic  all the way around. It is easy to put together, all of them look great, it is pretty easy to open as a first time mom and it is so easy to navigate. That really is my favorite thing about the stroller, once you have the wheels in the free-motion mode, it moves,like a dream! Almost like a dancing partner, I know it sounds silly but that's the truth! The price at Amazon is the best I found because there's no taxes and no shipping if you sign up for Amazon Mom. I have had no problems and would recommend this stroller to everyone!",5
Econobum Full Kit,"This kit is awesome. I just started cloth diapering and for the price you can't go wrong. The shells are thin but they still feel really durable, I don't feel like they will tear. The inserts are great..they are prefolds and are great for absorbing. I think this will be a great start off kit for my cloth diaper Endeavour.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"I had a second-hand fisher price ""deluxe"" jumperoo, but some of the toys did not function anymore... so I purchased this for my 4 month old son. I was worried at first that it had too many toys, and too much going on, but he loves it! It is the only thing he'll play with for more than five minutes. He really is not interested in any of the toys except the front toybar (where the lights are), but occasionally if he's getting bored with it, he turns to the other toys too. The seat has a head rest, and is set back from the toybar in such a way that even when he was a little shaky on holding his head up, he was not in danger of banging his head on anything (unlike other exersaucers and jumperoos I have encountered). This is the best one!!I gave it a 4/5 because it is hard to move around and is not easy to fold up, so it takes up a lot of room in our living room. Don't bother with the other jumperoos or exersaucers... this is both in one!",4
Bright Starts Lots of Links- Solid Colors,"I bought these after my granddaughter started teething and they are one of the most helpful baby items I've seen!  Our granddaughter loves the colors and soft ''chewy' feel to them, and my daughter and I love that they link EVERYTHING you can think of together so she can't lose them!! It's so awesome!!",5
"Munchkin Teething Baby Blanket, Colors May Vary","We received this blanket as a gift at the baby shower. Our 4 month old loves it!It goes everywhere with her. She really likes to cuddle with it when she is getting sleepy, and also likes the crinkly corner. She likes to give the monkey kisses to.I'm ordering a second one, just in case we happen to lose the first one, or anything detrimental were to happen to it.Highly recommended.",5
Sesame's Elmo Bath Mat 'splish Splash',"Do not buy this bath mat! The little decals come off and are choking hazards. My 18 month old son put a little quarter sized seashell decal in his mouth. Fortunately, I was able to perform the heimlich on him. It was extremely scary and I'm so grateful that he was alright.",1

"Playtex Flip Top Snacker with Twist 'N Click, Color may vary",One of the best baby products out there! You don't have to worry about Cheerios falling out. I love it.,5
"Zoobies Plush Toy, Furbie The Feline","The other review states it doesn't look like a real cat . . .well it is a little goofy but that's the general look of all of their products so I'm not sure if that should be a surprise since its intentionally organic. I think it's cute and so does my daughter but that's subjective I suppose. As far as usability . ..its not the typical pillow pet in the sense that at a sleepover they still need a pillow since once the blankets in use the animal is more of a huggable toy rather than a sleeping surface, not plush enough on it's own for a pillow. My daughter does love it though and it is very high quality,  this company obviously uses good workmanship and materials . .. after almost 6 months of use and banging around it looks brand new and is free of rips and tears. The blanket is a little wonky to get back in but that was expected just due to the nature of the design. Both the blanket and animal are extremely soft and wash up well. Great for long car trips and visits to other people's houses . . .not great for full out sleepovers, for that I had to buy a reg. pet of the pillow design. Still planning on buying another one for my youngest since overall it is a great product, very cute, high quality, and loved by the kids.",4
Safety 1st Fun Shapes Play Mats 9-Pack,"This product is a perfect play mat for babies. It cushions and insulates the wood floor, cleans easily, and has no small parts that would be choking hazards.

"Safety 1st Custom Fit All Purpose Strap, D&eacute;cor","I bought this to keep the plastic shotgun shell replica mailbox door closed. It really is too new to complely review it, but I will give it this much:There are two parts to it. (see picture) One is the adjustment/lock side (top as shown) which when adjusted and locked is permanent. I got the adjustment measured and the excess cut off. Then I affixed it to the top of the box, and drilled two small screws through it into the mailbox to make it impossable to remove. The other side, with the release ears, is attached to the door with only two sided tape...but it should hold as it is very sticky. If it turns loose, I will super glue it and/or drill it!The postman figured it out without instruction, so I think anyone can! (-:",5
"Leachco Podster Sling-Style Infant Seat Lounger, Sage Pin Dot","My 4 month old daughter loves this seat.  She can recline in it like a regular bouncy seat, but the advantage of this lounger is that she can also sit upright, surrounded by pillows to cushion the inevitable topples.  She likes tummy time on the lounger too.  I prop her up with her legs in the sling and her arms on the cushion to give her a better view than she gets with tummy time on a mat.  So far, the lounger seems durable and well-designed for babies.",5
Disney Winnie the Pooh - Inflatable Safety Bathtub for Baby,"We have a big boy and he started to grow rapidly. This tub helped us transition from the sink tub to the bath tub. He loves to play in it, we found it safe, convenient to carry and move around (even travel with it) and easy to store, clean and maintain.",5
Baby Einstein Discovering Music Activity Table,"I love most things from Baby Einstein, however like many of the other reviews this table is slightly dangerous. It looks great and has a many fun activities for the little ones. The table itself is NOT sturdy! I have hard wood floors so my 8 month old daughter slides this all over the floor. I just put a play mat under it to help with stability. It still tips over but shes not chasing it across the room. She loves it so I'm pretty happy with it too.",4
"HALO 100% Cotton Muslin Sleepsack Swaddle, Gator Plaid, Newborn",Very light material-perfect for Arizona summer sleeping. My baby kept &#34;hulking&#34; out of it and would get mad.. so we eventually stopped using it.,5
"Stephen Joseph Nap Mat, Butterfly","This nap mat is perfect for my preschooler to use during naptime.  It is very soft.  The cover folds down instead of to the side like most of the store-bought nap mats.  The pillow is removable from the butterfly's head by way of a zipper so the mat can be washed.  The mat is designed to be rolled up a certain way so it can be fastened by the attached velcro strap and worn on the back.  The instructions were not included, but it was pretty easy to figure out.",5
JOTO Premium Screen Protector Film HD Ultra Clear (Invisible) for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7.0 Inch Tablet with Lifetime Replacement Warranty (3 Pack),Everything was what I expected it to be. I'm so glad that I brought it when I saw it online.,5
Baby Trend Flex-Loc Infant Car Seat - Silverado,This carseat is nice - to look at. My son grew out of it at 3 months old. The straps do not accomodate a baby who is over 14-15 pounds. They become very tight and I had to replace it already. It was very disappointing since I also purchased the coordinating jogging stroller. I ended up buying a convertible carseat since I did not want to have to buy another infant seat. However I get really frustrated having to take my baby in and out of the seat all the time instead of being able to transport him in an infant seat. Bottom line is this seat is a waste of money.,1
TUPPERWARE Shape O Ball Toy,Same great toy that I had as a toddler! I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a sturdy educational toy that will last and last!,5
Safety 1st Prograde Complete Family Thermometer,This thermometer works great. It is fast and accurate. I have seen a few reviews here and elsewhere talking about getting different readings when taking the temperature one after the other. If the temp is taken repeatedly without a few minute break you will always get an incorrect reading with digital thermometers. So the first reading is the correct temp. Another thing to keep in mind is that when taking temperatures you need to look at what site you are using. If taking a temperature orally the normal temp is around 98.6F. If you are doing it in the armpit the temperature will read 0.5-1 degrees lower than an oral temp.. and rectally will read 0.5-1 degrees higher. Hope this helps you guys when using this product in the future :),5
DadGear Backpack Diaper Bag - Red Retro Stripe,"Very smartly designed.  Lots of pockets in all the right places and sizes.  I like the smaller top pocket for quick access to small things like pacifier, snack trap...  I also like the retro styling.  We used to have a diaper dude. But not even a year went by and it started to fall apart.  zipper pulls came off and inner lining ripped.  It was also too small to have for long day trips or on the plane, as we flew quite a bit.  Also the strap on the messenger style 'dude' always seemed to be the wrong length and the shoulder cushion twisted the wrong way, and when I was bending over to pick up baby it was always falling forward and getting in the way.  I searched extensively for backpack-style bags because I liked having my hands free now that baby is more mobile, but didn't want just any back pack with a large inner compartment that I would lose the smaller things to the bottom of the bag only to spend time digging and unpacking to find these things. I found the DadGear backpack on ebags.  THe DadGear backpack is well compartmentalized and large enough for our needs when we go on day trips, and even a weekend outing, but also has small pockets for quick and easy access to commonly and immediately needed things.  The inner compartment is large enough for a few books / toys, change of clothes, bib, and a light jacket with room to spare. I usually put eating and diapering supplies in the smaller pockets. It's mostly comfortable: We did a lot of walking when we were in Europe recently and my upper back did get sore after a few days. I wish it had a chest strap to distribute the weight on my shoulders a little better.  There is no waist / hip strap to distibute some of the weight to the hips, but I generally don't like that because that would make for more straps hanging off the bag to get caught on stuff (and my shoulders would still get sore anyway, but a chest strap would be useful.)  I like the overall relatively streamlined design.  The refillable diaper dispenser is a bit small and sometimes annoying to refill, but still sooo handy when you really need it. When we just go to the grocery store or run quick errands the DadGear back pack is a bit big and I usually just stuff a couple diapers and a ziploc of wipes in my purse and call it good.",5

"LA Baby 3&quot; Compact Crib Mattress, White","I bought this because the listing said it is 24""x36"".  When I received it, though, I found that it's actually 38"" long, which is too long for my crib, so I had to return it.  Beware!",3
"Woolzies 3 XL Wool Dryer Balls ,Natural Fabric Softener","I love the idea of these dryer balls.  I'm not sure how it works, but it does.  The only reason I gave it four stars is because you need a lot of them.  Not just 3.  You need like 6 or 8 or more.  It is worth it, because it works.  They are a bit pricey, but remember you only have to buy them once.",4
Safety 1st Safe-Glow Nursery Monitor 2 Receiver Set,"We were disappointed to find that this monitor did not work at all in our house. It was so static-y that my boyfriend couldn't even hear me over the noise and he was just down the hall. I'm very glad we tried it out before our son gets here. However, I'm not looking forward to having to keep trying out different monitors till we find one that will actually work.",1
"Contours Options LT Tandem Stroller, Valencia Gold","I spent hours reviewing different double strollers.This stroller is very functional. I have gotten quite a few compliments on it as it is quite eye-catching. The basket underneath is easy to access and large.I am adding this information...There is a car seat attachment included that fits many car seats. I have a Graco Snugride carseat and it fits mine. I researched this on the website before I bought my stroller. Kolcraft has a list of all the seats that fit here... [...]Update: I have had this stroller for about a year. I still get tons of compliments on it. It is generally holding up great. My only concern is sometimes if I go to push it and the wheel is in the wrong position, it won't roll around in to the right position. This is particularly troublesome when someone else is pushing it and they try to muscle through it instead of backing up and getting it situated. Hopefully it won't break doing this.I know this stroller is like a bus, but it is a little hard to push loaded down with a 3 y.o. and a 1 y.o. It hurts my forearms if the terrain is variable, like can happen on a paved trail.",5

"Squooshi Reusable Food Pouch, Small Lion/Bluebird, 2.5 Ounce, 4-Count","I was so relieved when I found this product because my nine month old had started refusing to eat from a spoon, he only wanted to feed himself. He would take only the disposable pouches and finger foods. I have always made his food for him and I have a freezer full of homemade pureed food that I couldn't use, until I did some research and found this product. Cannot tell you how thankful I am. I can now use all of my healthy pureed foods and know my baby is getting the nutrition he needs but I am also cutting on costs, yay!!! I chose this brand because they are exactly like the disposable ones (the caps from the disposable ones even fit these so I saved a few in case we lose any) with the spout on top so I knew it would be easier to trick him. It worked!!! Happy, healthy baby and happy mommy! :)",5
"Prince Lionheart pottyPOD, Blue",LOVE LOVE this potty seat. it is comfortable enough that your child can sit and listen to you read a book. Easy Easy to clean and dump.  Buy coffee filters (small ones) and put inside for when your child goes #2 so much easier then getting the mess off the potty itself (this will work with any potty seat of course!) and they can be flushed.,5
"DK Leigh Nursery Crib Bedding Set, Frog, 10 Piece","I was really excited when I received this bc I fell in love with the colors. Which it's exactly what you see bright greens n the brown is gorgeous. The characters are very nice. The reason I gave it a 3 stars is bc by the first wash the bumper was really in bad shape the little ties fell off really easy. The colors are still vibrant but in bad shape! If I would have known, I would have given a couple of passes with the sewing machine through out the bumper so the filling wouldn't have move around like it did. It was also a little off with my sons crib maybe that's why the ties fell, had to improvise with it.",3

"Woombie Convertible Baby Swaddler (Big Baby 14-19 lbs, Little Monster)","These things are amazing.  My daughter always broke out of blankets and even the Velcro swaddlers.  When she started rolling I knew it wasn't safe to swaddle her anymore but she would NOT sleep otherwise and I was going crazy. A friend recommended woombie and I love so much about it: it is stretchy unlike the other brands of swaddlers, it zips so she can't get out, and she can feel all cozy with arms out.  It has been a real sanity saver! But get several in case they all need washing (we have had some terrible days when they all get pooped on) and know that they do shrink even on low heat.",5

Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump,"as soon as I tried my new Medela advanced pump I knew I had to come on here and write a review about how this pump had a negative impact on my breastfeeding experience.I got the Ameda Purely Yours  through my health insurance program like many others. I use it my second day home with my daughter and everything seemed to be going great. I filled both bottles with milk and life was good. I was excited that I was able to breast feed and pump when you hear so many horror stories about how it doesn't work out for so many women.after only a few short weeks, maybe 2 or 3, I noticed I was producing a lot less when I pumped. Like maybe half a bottle for each breast. Then it was even less. After a call to la leche league and them telling me my pump was a good model I thought maybe it was me. After many frustrated conversations with many lactating mothers I concluded that maybe I wasn't pumping enough, maybe I was only producing as much as the baby ate which must have been less than the supply that came in.. Which made no sense considering she is a champion eater and loves to nurse. Often. So I am parked on the journey many breastfeeding mothers who are having difficulty do. I tried taking fenugreek supplements to boost my milk supply and pumping more often. I would stay up late at night despite being exhausted to pump. I remember sitting at the kitchen table those early weeks my daughter was home, her strapped into her bouncy seat and whining unhappily because instead of paying attention to her I was sitting at the kitchen table sleep deprived and in pajama pants, with the pump strapped to me. praying that my pump would produce what my friends seemed to get. Then I felt guilty for taking time away from my daughter and husband. I was afraid I wasn't producing enough but when I went to the pediatrician for my daughters one month check up she had gained over two pounds. Obviously supply was not the problem. But still I could not seem to get much out of the pump so I began to supplement my daughter with formula when I left her with a babysitter or when we left the house as I do not feel comfortable nursing in public.  I felt like I had failed and my poor little girl did not like the taste or consistency of the stuff and wouldn't drink much. So this put more pressure and guilt on me.Around Christmas i saw a relative who was nursing her 6 month old. She asked me what pump I was using when I described my problems to her. She said "" I had the exact same problem! We got this comp because the hospital told us it was sanitary and a closed system but it had no suction. I got the Medela advanced and it was like night and day. You should get one of those.""While I waited for my new health insurance to take effect so I could get this new pump, I ended up buying a manual pump and using that on one side while my daughter nursed on the other and it produced better results than this supposedly high end double electric pump.And as promised I tried my new Medela advanced pump and it has made a world of difference. I now have hope that I can possibly produce enough pumped milk to keep my daughter happy when I am away or when we leave the house. I no longer feel like I am in a horrible predicament or like I am an inadequate mother. There is absolutely nothing wrong with using to feed your infant formula but for my particular infant she greatly prefers my breastmilk and that is what makes her happy and works best for us. What my messages to anyone is do not buy this pump! It really did a number on us! Get a Medela advanced. seriously.",1
ULTRASCALE MBSC-55 Digital Baby Pet Scale,"Nice scale with a good feature set. I've used it a few times. Time will tell if it is durable. My only complaint so far is the type/number of batteries needed (4-""c"" battery. A comparable scale I use only needs one 9 volt, very infrequently)",4
FitBALL Seating Disc 15&quot; Iridescent Blue (Poly Bag),"Current as of this writing.You should see a small plastic bag with two white plastic objects inside of it. One of them looks like a fork, the other looks like a plug. Now look at your seating disk. There is a small round white thing that looks like a valve. It's not a valve, it's a plug. You can't stick anything in there. You cannot blow into it. It's a duplicate plug. It's the same as the plug that's in the small plastic bag.To inflate your seating cushion. Use that white plastic fork to remove the duplicate white plug that's already in your seating disk. Blow into it (don't worry, you probably won't get poisoned). Replace the plug, using either of your two same plugs. And that's it.Edit:As others have said, you might experience some back pain until you get used to it. If you do experience any new back pain, exercise caution and put the device aside for a day or longer before continuing. There is nothing wrong with taking your time to get used to it. Mine is barely inflated, just to take pressure off of my butt bones. The design could be better IMO, but it's very sturdy and works well anyway. No more butt bone pain even when sitting for many hours during the day.Edit 2:Using it for three months. Love it. Took my butt pain away. It's portable, so I can use it in a chair, on the floor, anywhere. I'm impressed by how its loose fitting valve can hold air so well.",4
Evenflo Splash Mega Exersaucer,"We purchased this for our son when he was four months old. He absolutely enjoys his time in it. It keeps him occupied and entertained while he is learning to use his little leg muscles. He is now 9 months old and still finding a lot of use for his exersaucer. I've had to adjust the height to accommodate his growth spurts, but that only takes a brief moment. This is now the second exersaucer I've bought (my daughter had a pink one) and I fully endorse the use of them! If price is an issue, you can sometimes find them cheap at Big Lots.",5
Wonderworld Peek-a-boo Ball,"WARNING: After writing the below review, I read other reviews warning about the pieces that come off, and that it should only be given to 3 yr-olds and up. Though this didn't happen to mine, I can certainly see how it could, and wanted to include the warning here too - it does have pieces that if come off, are small enough an infant could choke on.Original Review:I got this for my 1-yr old nephew for his first birthday.  Out of all the toys he got, he like this one the best and rolled it around all day.  It's the simplest of construction - just 6 little heads that pop out when gravity pulls them out, but he was completely entranced.  It looks really strange/intriguing as it rolls around on the ground - as if there were some actual mechanism in it.  (hard to explain).  For 10 bucks, this is a no-brainer.",3
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"We were on a hike when our 3 yr old announced he needed to poop. We panicked!  We could barely get him to poop on a potty. How were we going to get him to poop in the woods?  Our friends has this potty seat in their day pack. Our son loved it. He Saturday right on the side of the mtn and did his business. We promptly ordered our own. It is awesome!  We keep it in the car. It has been so useful on road trips. We pull over, set it up in the back of the van, and our son goes right away. So wonderful for reluctant potty trainers!!!!",5
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty","The seat reeks of quality.  The fabric is terrific, the padding all in the right places.  My baby is quite comfortable riding in this seat.  I have a few problems with this seat however.1.  The latch is difficult to unbuckle.  You really have to push hard and use both hands.  I am a man with beast-hands and it still takes me a few seconds to unlatch.  My concern is if there is an emergency situation such as a fire, those few seconds can be deadly.2.  If you are the type to remove this seat often, or move this seat between cars, this may not be for you.  First, it is very large and heavy.  But most importantly, to do rear facing, you have to feed the strap (with child seat latches) through a narrow and long path in the back.  This means the seat has to be taken out, placed on the ground, and laid on its side to get the strap through.  You can forget about tightening it after you latch it, there isn't a single strap you can yank to tighten it against the seat.  This makes the process of installing the seat very long, and you will be sweaty.",4
#NAME?,"I have had the smaller and larger size ones for a couple of years and they have taken a beating.  What I like about the smaller one is that it is perfect for keeping business cards in pristine condition so when you give one out, it looks good.  I hate cards in a normal wallet and they bend and fold and after spending good money on getting them designed, they look bad.  With the Umbra cases, you don't have to worry about that at all and they look pretty cool as well.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","&#34;Look, a zeeba!  It's a zeeba!&#34;  You can't do much better than that when your 4-year old sees you pulling her new zebra backpack out of the box.  So, she loves the design, and mommy and daddy love the solid construction (I've even picked it up by the ears and yarn hairs when grabbing without looking, with no indication that it'll fall apart any time soon), the padded shoulder straps (not too narrow, not to wide, with anatomical curve), the oversized zipper pulls and smooth zipper action (just right for little hands), and the size (just right for little torsos).  Okay, you can't put papers in it without them getting wrinkled corners, as others have mentioned, but they're preschoolers.  Everything else gets wrinkled, stained, and torn, so why not the stupid notices about how to check your kid's scalp for lice?",5
"NoJo Night Light, Butterfly",Good night light and very nice looking.  Matches perfectly the other sports theme items in the room.  A bit pricey but has worked out well for us.,4
"Maclaren Volo Stroller, Pea Green and Black Stripe","PROS:Easy to open - you can flip the latch with a single finger, then step on it - and voila.Easy to close - step on the side lever, then pull the strap and throw it over your shoulder (and at 8 lbs, you can carry stroller AND kid).Comfortable handles - the handles are at a comfortable height for me (5'6"" - and our 6' family members).Steers like a dream - the stroller really is easy to push and not hard to steer, I've pushed it one handed in the mall.High weight limit - what attracted me in the first place is the high weight limit, in the hopes that it will be the last stroller I buy. I also like that it's a little sturdier than some of the cheaper umbrella strollers, I feel like it will stand the test of time until the higher weight limit will actually apply to my son (like in three or four years).BEST USES: I don't think this stroller is built for rugged terrain. It handles fine on the sidewalk, but this is an ideal stroller to keep in the trunk of your car to run into the post office or the mall - or to take on trips - it will be a breeze in the airport. It would probably be disappointing if you planned to get rid of your other strollers and use this as a primary.CONS:The front wheels touch the inside of the canopy when closed, so you need to throw a plastic garbage bag over the wheels to keep it clean. I just don't want dirt from the wheels near my kid's head, but I don't suppose you have to go through this added step unless you are as anal as I am.The reason it only got four stars is that I'm not a big fan of the straps and safety is an important issue. I feel like the clip itself (which the straps snap into) is cheap plastic, but the main problem is the straps are super long. I recognize this is important so that the stroller can grow with the child, BUT they are very loose on my one year old. Now that it is winter and he's in bulkier clothes, it's not as much of a problem, but it is something to be aware of before purchasing.MY JOURNEY TO MACLAREN:I was looking for a second stroller, one for quick jaunts to the mall, because I was tired of lugging around my 29-pound monster (theGraco Quattro Tour Sport in Nolan. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE my Graco travel system - it has a smooth ride and lots of features and is my go-to stroller for long walks around the neighborhood or for outdoor events where I'm going over grass and rough terrain.But I'm not crazy about hefting it in and out of my trunk to run a bunch of errands.I thought I'd go for an upgraded lightweight stroller because I wanted something that would be comfortable and long-lasting. I also feel spoiled because the Graco is so easy to push.Initially I purchased theJoovy Kooper Umbrella Stroller, Red. It received rave reviews on Amazon and looked cool and stylish and it seemed like it had some nice added features. I bought it sight unseen online. BIG MISTAKE. It was impossible to push (front wheels malfunctioned). I ended up returning it a month later.In looking for a lightweight replacement, I narrowed down to aZooper Twist Stroller, Coconut Waveswhich cost about the same amount as the Joovy Kooper - but included a foot muff, rain cover and mosquito net. I was hesitant because I'd been burned once ordering a stroller online without ever pushing it. I also was considering MacLaren, since I could test it out in stores - but hadn't yet gone to test drive them.On a lark I picked up a MacLaren Volo (I saw it at a discount store for less than half the price of the Joovy, and less than the price on here). I am sooooo glad that I did. The MacLaren Volo is cute (not quite as much of a statement stroller as the Joovy Kooper) - but so much easier to push and really, functionality is way more important than having a stylish stroller that sits in your trunk!",4
OiOi 2 Pocket Hobo Diaper Bag - Monaco Navy Mini Geo - 6608,"I purchased this bag as a second diaper bag so that I would have a bag that could also be used as a &#34;cross-body.&#34; This bag is made of very high quality materials, and the strap is super easy to adjust, so I can easily throw it over my shoulder or quickly lengthen the strap and sling it across my front. Also, the stroller straps tuck nicely into the sides of the bag, and are not visible when the bag is zipped. The changing pad that is included is super lightweight, but not very big. The wipe box is great and closes very well even when it's packed full of wipes, so the wipes don't dry out. Also, the bottle cooler bag is a huge plus. Genius!In my opinion, the major drawback of this bag is the size. It's not very big and because of it's incredible, durable construction, the sides aren't very flexible, so it's not very easy to cram a bunch of junk in here. That's good and bad, though, because with a bigger bag, you'll probably end up carrying more junk. The other drawback for me, personally, is the rose gold finishes. I wish it was just regular yellow gold, but I can live with it. Overall, this is an excellent bag and is great looking. Would highly recommend!",5
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!",These are a nice texture and length. All the other swaddling blankets I recieved were way too small for my baby after a couple weeks. They also work well as a way to cover myself when I'm nursing.,5
"Clek Ozzi Portable Booster Car Seat, Licorice","The seat is certainly better than a generic run of the mill booster seat you can pick up at any large box store.  It should be for the price.  It was not that easy to put the seat in my BMW 2011 M3 Sedan.  I struggled to get it to the right angle.  So for at least that car the seat is not easy to remove and install on a regular basis.  It will mainly stay in the car.  Also, this seat did not come with the quick release and I would have to spend even more money for that feature.",3

"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I'm a new, first-time mom (our daughter is 6 weeks old), and after a week of holding onto the breastpump parts while pumping, decided it was time to look for something that would let me pump hands-free.  This is absolutely perfect!The sizing is great (I was a 36C before, somewhere around a DD or E now, and ordered the L/XL size).  The velcro pieces are wonderful, the sizing is remarkably flexible and well thought out.  The nipple shields stay perfectly in place, and there's enough support to hold onto the bottles I pump into (so far it's taken about 6 oz of weight, I assume there won't be a problem if/when I'm pumping more).I'm very easily able to use the computer or talk on the phone, etc... only limited by the length of the tubing now.I couldn't have asked for a better product!",5
SheetWorld Fitted Pack N Play (Graco) Sheet - Hot Pink Jersey Knit - Made In USA,I searched everywhere looking for a playpen sheet that would fit my Foundations playpen I bought on here.

"3 Sprouts Storage Caddy, Mouse","The mouse is really cute and the colors matched my nursery's decor, so I bought it even though I thought it was a little overpriced. Now that I have it, I know that it is overpriced. I had to cut a piece of cardboard and stick it in the bottom to make it stable enough to stand upright. It's lined with some sort of plastic-y material so it's really stiff and hard to unfold. It fits about 30/40 diapers. Overall, I wouldn't purchase it again and thought about returning it, but it's too much hassle.",3
"Medela Easy Expression Hands-Free Bustier, White, Small","The idea of this pumping bra is fabulous in my opinion but I feel the sizing is completely off.  I ordered a M and I am currently 25wks pregnant with my 2nd and a 36B/C bust.  This bra did not even wrap around my body let alone could I zip it up.  I am definitely in no way &#34;large busted&#34; and never have been so I am surprised at this! Quite frankly, I am not even sure a size L would fit once my milk comes in.  I am returning this item and will go the route of buying a sports bra and cutting holes in it to make my own pumping bra.",2
Baby Einstein Bendy Ball,"I was quite disappointed. It doesn't teach a baby to hold a smooth ball or to roll a ball. The hard plastic part that goes around the ball to hold the two sides together is really bumpy and thick. It keeps the ball from rolling straight, hard for teaching the baby to roll it back to you. It's more like a rattle that a baby can shake and throw. My 9 month old isn't too interested in it, though. And I was surprised to be able to see little screws on the hard plastic part. It doesn't look safe.",2
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","I actually like the tub fine in terms of functionality. My problem with it is that, even though every night after bath time, I turn it around and let the sling and the tub air dry, MOLD is forming in the foamy part of the sling!!!Its just so dangerous and unhealthy. I imagine a different material would be helpful. Maybe all just the mesh?Anyone else have this problem?",1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I really like that I can have a cd player right in the crib and it's easily accessible.

I highly recommend this product if you have a grumpy sleeper who needs soothing with music.",5
"NUK Large Learner Cup, 10 Ounce","I bought this cup to transition my son from Dr. Browns bottles, which was getting to be a hassle to clean.

Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This is the best swing I have ever seen or used!  My daughter loves it!  My only wish is that it A) has an AC adapter so you don't go thru so many batteries, and B)the pillow was detachable for easy cleaning (seems the pillow gets the drool and ick faster than the seat part).  Other than that this is a great swing..highly recommend",5
Mud Pie Baby Perfectly Princess Castle Box Tea Set,"First off, this teaset is a toy, and as such it is very small, for having tea with dolly. The plates, like the Schylling, are maybe 3"" in diameter. The painted decorations are very pretty and artistic looking, not cookie cutterish or glaring. I am surprised at how well the black and pink go together, not too harsh. The linens included: A round (poly/washable) tablecloth edged with lace and two rectangular napkins also edged with lace, all have what looks like a monogram on it in pink: HRH, for ""Her Royal Highness,"" of course! The little silver utensils, fork, knife and teaspoon, are a pretty pattern and quite feminine also. The box is small, just the right size to carry by the little rope handle to a friends' house for tea. It looks nice in her room, too. I also bought a tin teaset so that she could become accustomed to holding the teacups and playing a bit before she used the porcelain one. She takes care when playing with it, but isn't so careful as to interfere with the fun of playing. It's so funny, because she refers to her tin teaset as  the ""everyday"" teaset and this one as her ""good set."" She really enjoys all the ladylike accoutrements of this set. I bought her some ""first tea"" books and we make scones and have our tea together.The ""silver,"" the ""linens,"" and the monograms all make her feel very grown up and appropriately indicate what a special time tea time is. It's fun to play about with teddy with the tin set, but when she wants to play at Palm Court tea, we use the Princess set. Bought for child's fifth birthday and as mentioned, with care it is a good fit for her agewise. It truly makes her feel like a princess!",5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","We used this everywhere!!

The way I fixed this was to set the settings and then put duct tape over the whole panel of switches.Otherwise, it works great and we're happy with it.",4

Chicco KeyFit &amp; KeyFit30 Infant Car Seat Base - Anthracite,"We bought a Chicco Keyfit 30 system for our last child and saved it. We checked the expiration dates recently and when we saw they were still good, decided to reuse them for our newest addition to the family. We decided we would purchase an extra car seat base for my spouse's car to save him time and energy when picking up the kids after work.Chicco products are the epitome of safety and convenience and this car seat base is no exception. This base accomodates a 22 pound or 30 pound Chicco carseat. You can install the base using the latch or belt system; we use latch and it is ridiculously fast and simple. There are bubble windows in the sides of the base with adjustable foot to tell you if your base is level. The Chicco system is so advanced yet so simple--your carseat essentially clicks in or out with no more effort than the click of button. The base is easy enough to swap between vehicles but I feel that the price is well warranted for the safety of the Chicco product so we went ahead and sprang happily for my husband's base.I really can't find a flaw with the product. I feel that it has proven itself through multiple professional reviews on safety, quality, and ease of use. I hope you are similarly satisfied with this great product.",5
Playtex Ortho-Pro Silicone Older Baby Pacifier,"These are the only kind of pacifier that my baby could use when she was teething. They are thin and ""kinked"" in the area that passes over the gums, thus minimizing the pressure put on the already sensitive area. My baby needs a binky to sleep, but when she was teething other binkies hurt her. This kind didn't hurt her at all! I was very happy with this product. It comes in ""girly"" colors too.",5
Beco Gemini Baby Carrier - Paige,"I did loads of research before deciding on this carrier.  I am very happy with my decision!  I was between this and the Ergo, and choose this one based on aesthetics.  It is very easy to get on and off, and to get baby in and out.  A big plus when put running errands.  I've used this carrier since my LO was 6 weeks old (never used an insert), and he is 8 months now.  The buckles take some getting used to, but I can do them by myself, one handed.  I've been too scared to wash it because of other reviews, but spot cleaning has worked just fine.  My friend has the ergo, and she actually wishes she had this one because of how easy it is to get baby in and out.  Overall, I absolutely love this carrier and recommend this carrier to every expectant mom I meet!",5
Medela Valves &amp; Membranes (Set of 2),I pump a lot and having extra valves comes in handy so I don't have to wash the same ones all the time (who has time for that),5
"Boppy Noggin Nest Head Support, Brown Wheels","it is really helpful for flat head. Nevertheless, the material is like poly*, and not very comfortable. Good to buy.",4
Daddy's Girl (Pink) Pacifier,"Our little one is only 3 weeks, and this is still too big for her (and we're limiting the use of paci's still at this point), but I love that this has it's own case, and the design is adorable.",4
Instant Murals Soccer Wall Transfer Stickers - Sports Balls,"Nice looking, a little bit on the edge of Antique looking, also kind of small, the biggest one is about the size of a grapefruit, so you need more than one package to get the sports look.",4
"The First Years  Deluxe Fold and Go Diapering Kit, Black/Gray",I hate diaper bag. That huge nursery looking sag will be always with me? Hell noooooooo!!!!!  But i needed something that holds few diaper and wipes. This deluxe fold and go is amazing. Everything i needed. It holds 3 size 3 diaper. 1 travel case ( huggies) wipes diaper rash cream ( mustella). In that zipper bag i put my credit card cash and my keys.And its a good 6 hours outside.  I am breastfeeding mom so i dont need anything besides my fold and go. 10$????? You cant beat the price. Just 2 cup of frappucino price something useful for long time.,5
"Lifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Sky/Spring Green",My little guy is only 4 months but was starting to chew on everything trying to get those teeth out! I ordered these teethers and he loves them. He can grip them with one or both hands easily and it really works on his coordination as he maneuvers it into his mouth. It's become his favorite toy and when I put it in the freezer it stays soft without becoming so cold that it freezes his hands. I love these teethers!!!,5
"Organic Farm Buddies Rattle, Penny the Piggy","I liked this organic rattle, I am just hoping my little one likes it as much as I do. Seems like it is a good quality and the rattling sound is very soft not annoying at all.",5
"Britax Marathon 70 Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","After reading many, many reviews, we decided to buy this carseat for our 20 month old, who we are still putting rear-facing, based on its excellent ratings especially when safety is concerned.  Are we ever disappointed!  First off, the installation instructions are difficult to follow - and my husband and I both have PhDs (not in car seat installation, mind you).  Once installed, it still seems wobbly and unstable.  We had intended to use this car seat between my husband's SUV, my MiniCooper, and our nanny's four-door sedan - forget it!  It takes too long to take out and put in another car, so it is staying put in our SUV; I doubt highly it would fit in a much smaller car.  The cushy inserts are nice ... until our daughter pulled them out, as they are only attached via velcro.  The one good thing I have to say about it is that it does look very comfortable, although my tall daughter's legs still have to bend; I'm hoping I'll like it better after her 2nd b-day when we put it front-facing.  If you are looking for a front-facing, comfortable carseat, with excellent safety ratings, that will stay put in one car, and don't mind spending a few frustrating hours (or paying someone to install it) - this is your carseat.  However, if you are looking for a carseat that can easily go from one vehicle to another, or if you have a small-ish car, or if your child is still rear-facing and tall - run far, far away.",2
"Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Navy/Red","I picked these up thinking like most of the other products that are supposed to secure toys/binkies it wouldn't work or only for a short time... boy was I wrong.  I totally love these baby buddies.  I am going to order a few more sets cause 2 just aren't enough.Not only are they durable, but they can be changed to any size you need.  They are also strong enough that my 9 month old can't get the snaps undone, but not so secure that I don't get them undone in a second.I am also buying these for all of my friends baby showers moving forward.  As a mom of 2 this has to be hands down one of the better products I've used!",5
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,"I thought this would work for our road trip, but it ended up being more of a hassle than anything else.  it's too soft of a bottom, so puzzles are hard. it gives some surface to work from for coloring, but not really at a great angle.  Maybe for an older kid it will be better, but for a two year old, it wasn't great.",2
"Boppy Tummy Support Band, Medium/Large",Love the warm/cold pack for the lower back. My pregnancy was horribly uncomfortable and some days I could barely move without pain in my back and hips. This band gave good support with the additional comfort of a heat pack!,4
Biodegradable Disposable Placemats 24 Count (4 placemats per package) - by Mighty Clean Baby,"I purchased these since they were the least expensive, I have only used a few so far and they have worked okay so far except the fact that there is not a sticky strip along the sides, only the top & bottom. So when my son found that he could grab at the sides he could easily pull it off the table. I know there are other versions that have sticky strips along all four sides and next time I will buy those instead.",3
"DaVinci Kalani 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry",I was disappointed in the fact that you see every screw that is used to put it together. I have seen other cribs and this is not the case. It detracts for the bed.,3
"Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White","I don't actually have the baby so I can't speak to its usefulness yet. What I can speak to is quality.First of all the Oasis slipcover. It is super cute but the material is not soft. It feels like the cheap low thread count sheets I purchased for our rarely used guest bed. After a lot of washing I'm sure it will soften up.Second, the pillow itself. The quality looks fine until you get to the part where the fabric was closed after stuffing. The seam is like when I hastily make a home made pillow and after stuffing just quickly sew it shut. There is a spot where a stitch was dropped and a lot of bunched up thread. You can clearly see the 6 inch spot where the fabric was closed instead of having a seam that hides where this opening was. Because of the dropped stitch I'm hanging on to the receipt it case it falls apart after washing.Finally the terrible smell! I'm sure this will air out but the annoying thing is if they had packaged it differently it would never have smelled so bad. It comes in a clear vinyl bag made out of the same kind of vinyl that shower curtains are made out of and it has the same terrible chemical smell. I'm not scared it is going to harm me, it is just nauseating and giving me a headache. The pillow is washable along with the slipcover if the vinyl smell does not go away before my baby arrives.",3
Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,"I am very happy with this mattress, It is just what I thought it would be and my granddaughter slept just fine in the crib when was staying with us",5
"Summer Infant Bibbity, Pink",Love this bib for my toddler. It does seem to stain easily but I don't really care because it is so easy for me to wash it. It doesn't seem to stink like other bibs start to do over time. My son is 2 and could wear it for quite some time still.,5
Sassy Flip &amp; Grip Rattle 2 Pack,"fairly inexpensive, and the kids just loves it! BUT when you go to clean it only use wipes water gets inside and then stays there if you wet it, we keep ours in the car for the babies to play with and it keeps them happy.",5
"Thirsties Deluxe Diaper Duffle, White","It's been a great product. Everything we needed. I bought two for daycare to use too. No leaks, no smells.",5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"We have enjoyed the use of this product for our son. The foot pedal is the main reason we chose this product. With a squirming child, being able to use one hand for diaper disposal is a plus! We have had no issues with odor. I also love the economical practicality of the refills. The fact that you can choose how much of the bag to tie up makes it user friendly and saves money. In the nursery, it looks like just a waste basket instead of a ""poop disposal unit"" as my husband calls it. I can't say enough about how easy it is to change the refills and empty the bags. The double doors are easy to push the diaper through and keeps your hands and the unit clean. Do yourself a favor and give this one a try, you won't regret it!",5
"Graco Sweet Slumber Sound Machine, White",We love this product! It has a great variety of white noise sounds or music to play for our 4 month old baby girl. And it has also has a blue light that can be used as a night light but I use it to calm my baby for naps. She likes to stare at it & listen to the heartbeat & it helps her fall asleep! It has a good volume range too. And the thing we like best because it's hard to find is you can use a timer but you can just let it play all night long! It will not turn itself off!,5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"It beeps all the time. If you leave it in one place and do not move (yourself, not the monitor) it works ok. If you walk infront of it, near it, or sometimes wherever, it starts beeping and sometimes in th middle of the night for no reason. The monitor is 900 MHz so range should not be an issue in a 1800 Sq foot house. We have a friend that has the same montior and she is having the same issues.",2
Sesame's Elmo Bath Mat 'splish Splash',"This bath mat does the trick for us. We sit one parent in the tub with our eight-month-old, and it provides a nice non-slip surface. Sometimes it floats up when we are filling the tub, but this does not create problems for us.",4
"OXO Tot Snack Disk, Green",I love how flat these containers are. They fit great in the diaper bag and wash well. I would recommend to parents looking for a snack container.,5
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,This product works well. The curved design makes diaper changing much safer and more comfortable.  Fits changing table perfectly. Bought cover to go with it so I can just put it in washer.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This is a great reliable toy. My son uses it every night and it is wonderful that it has a timer. I love the timer feature so I don't have to try to sneak in later to turn it off to conserve batteries. It is a must buy!!,5
"South Shore Angel Changing Table, Espresso","It is a good product. It is not really sturdy, it broke when my wife tried to move it by herself (not a god idea obviously). The the painting started to peel off. Good price though.",4
Leachco Bath 'N Bumper - Cushioned Bath Tub - Blue Fish,My one year old grandson had outgrown his plastic infant bath tub and we were looking for something to use in a textured tub as all bath mats seem to be made for non-textured surfaces.  This works great -- he's comfortable in it and it doesn't move around in the tub -- has a hook to hang it from the towel rod to dry.  He loves bath time!,5
"Bumkins Reusable Snack Bags, Green Turtle and Crocs, 2 Count",My son has a pretty boring lunch bag for school. He likes that his food is packed in easy to open bags with designs he likes on them. Easy to throw in with the weekly laundry to clean.,5
"Comotomo Silicone Baby Teether, Blue",It didn't work for little one. He has never had a paci. I don't think anything is wrong with this product it just didn't work for us.,4
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia","super easy to assemble, easy to install on the table and my baby is happy and secure. We love it.",5
"Thirsties Duo All in One Cloth Diaper, Blackbird, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I have cloth diapered two kids now and have tried just about every major brand.  As far as I am concerned, this is the perfect diaper for us. Very soft for baby.  The fleece does not pull on dry skin at all as some others do.  The leg gussets are just tight enough...no red marks and no leaks. Easy to use. Dries fast.  Love it and buying more.",5
Evenflo Big Kid Booster Car Seat - Mercury,My son loves this booster seat. It makes him feel like a big boy. He really likes having cup holders in his chair. I would recommend this booster chair.,5
"Handmade Crochet Baby Ballet Booties / Shoes (0-3M, Baby White / Pink Flowers)","This is so cute. It fits my daughter perfectly.It fits my daughter perfectly,it's so soft and comfortable.Most of all it has the strings to tie around her feetto prevent it from falling off.perfectly made. I highly recommend.",5
"Munch Oversized Black Wood Letters, T","For a capital letter &#34;T&#34; this product is pretty basic for the $30 something dollars spent. Before purchasing, you should be aware that the edges of this product are not solid black. I don't know if this was intentional or a lazy painting job. If that is not an issue then you can easily spray paint it any color you want in a few moments. Personally, I'm going to spray paint the letter black and cover it in matching black glitter for my living room.",3
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"This is the only diaper pail we've had and our son is now 2.  We use scented kitchen trash bags ($3-4 for a huge roll at Target) and that seems to improve it's olfactory-blunting performance even more.  For especially messy and stinky diapers, I'll pre-bag the whole bundle in a small scented bag ($1 for 100 at Dollar Tree) that I can rest in the opening of the Champ.This may seem like a lot of bother, but it's not!  I haven't even washed the Diaper Champ out or Lysol'd it in 2 years.  Did I really just admit that?!?  We empty it no more than 2x per week, on average 1x per week.  If there's ever a smell in the nursery, it's from the dipaer's presence pre-Diaper Champ entry.I do wish the Diaper Champ people could find a way to have some button the parent can push to flip the handle while keeping the 1 hand operation.  My son likes to put toys in the Champ and we've had several close calls when he was about to send a toy into the pail, never to be seen again (becasue who wants to retrieve it, let alone let their child play with it?!?).  Some simple child-proof mechanism would be a Godsend.Even with that said,  the Diaper Champ is a great product and I'd recommend it to anyone!",5
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive",I love these reusable snack bags. Being able to wash and reuse saves so many ziploc baggies. And the cute patterns are great for identifying my kids snacks. They are also easier for younger kids to hold and get snacks out of.,5
Munchkin Safe View Mirror,this was for a friend with a young child  the family said it was easy to but in car  and it made them comfortable knowing they could see their child and still drive safe,5
Soothie Pacifier Attacher - Bee with Honey Pot Clip,"my son loved the soothie pacifier but he'd always drop it then i'd have to wash it before giving it back. so i got this clip. it's so adorable even tho the bee looks like an alien, but the pot is too heavy and the clip isn't big enough so it doesn't stay on or it hangs and would pull his shirt. it is cute though.",2
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,I'm not a big fan of these bottles.  I think they let too much air into my baby's belly.  I think they are generally over rated.  I do however have to stick up for them.  They do not leak if put together correctly.  The most important thing is to make sure that they are completely dry before putting them together.  If there are wet at all they will leak.  Also you have to make sure you have the nipple fully pulled through the cap.,3
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","Thirsties covers are my favorite for use with our fitted cloth diapers.  The double gusset (elastic) is perfect for holding in messy diapers and gives them a secure and comfortable fit.  I prefer the snaps, because the velcro is too easily pulled off by my son.",5
Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker,A really  good  item!!  makes my  life easier!  not  just  for baby  food but  for stews and salsas! anything can be cook in here!,5
"Skip Hop Hug and Hide Activity Toy, Owl","We absolutly LOVE this owl! My daughter got it for Christmas (she was almost 3 months old). Now that she is almost 7 months old she loves to pull the baby owl from the pocket, chew on the teethers, look in the mirror, crinkle the wings. VERY HIGHLY recommend this toy! It is GREAT quality and GREAT fun!!",5
Sleep Buddy ~ Sleep Training System for Toddlers &amp; Pre-schoolers,"We used the system as instructed and had success within two days.  You really need to follow the program and not just expect the light to work on its own, but the results were immediate and have lasted for almost two months now.",5
Camp Grandma Grandchilds Smile Large Photo Tote Bag,My mother-in-law loved this gift for her birthday.  Good quality bag with good picture protection on front.,5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Blue","My little one loved to be swaddled.  When he stopped fitting in the smaller one, this one worked!",5
Fisher-Price Smart Stages 3-in-1 Rocker Swing,I liked the swing's multiple functioning ability. My baby loved the rocking chair rather than the swing. We have a bouncing chair and he likes it more than the swing. When the swing is in maximum setting he is afraid as it swings really fast. I wish there was a lower setting. And the music doesnot play without the swing. Sometimes he just likes to sit in the swing and listen to the music which is not possible with this one. And one more thing its really hard for me to put the chair back into the swing with one hand carrying the baby. And for me it always take some effort even with 2 hands. Thats the reason i gave it 4 stars. Otherwise overall its good.,4
"Britax Marathon Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","I originally bought the Britax Boulevard for my son who is 2 and was out growing his regular convertable carseat.  He is 35 pounds and needed a seat that would ""fit"" him.  That seat was not so great.  I sold it and bought this one instead.  I bought the Zebra print.  The seat is big and heavy, which I like since it looks and feels so safe.  I like that the instructions are attached to the seat so you can't lose them.  The seat was easy to adjust to fit my son and very very easy to install into my very small car (Suzuki Esteem).  After installing it with seatbelt it DOES NOT MOVE AT ALL... which we all know is safe.  Installation was so fast.  I love the belt lock offs.  The seat is very plush and soft.  I love the many covers available.  My son sits comfortably in this seat, there is plenty of room to grow, the crotch strap is so much better on this (than the Boulevard) and I am sure we are going to be able to use this seat for years to come.  I am so glad I found this.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed.",5
DaVinci Parker 2-Door Changer in Pure White,"Love the color and the style of these pieces! Have not had the chance to use it since baby isn't here yet, but love the style and color.",5
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,Love this because it is light weight and compact.  We keep this in our van and have used it on multiple occasions while traveling.  You can even use the bags for when you are unable to get out of the vehicle due to weather or the distance to the next rest-stop.  Would buy again.,5
The First Years miPump Double Electric Breast Pump,"The pump works well as a double pump, but not as well if you want to do a single pump.",3
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units,"Love love love this monitor. We started out with a cheaper monitor but got so frustrated. This one is crystal clear, long range, and we love the customization options on it.",5
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","This stroller is excellent overall.  It's tall enough to push comfortably without having to hunch over, it has a sun canopy, it folds up easily with one hand to a fairly compact profile.  I like the hippo pattern (we have the brown one).  The one little thing that I would change about it would be to make the space between the back wheels just a little bit wider because as they are, I am constantly kicking the back of the wheels as I'm pushing the stroller.",4
"Mud Pie Cuff, To The Moon","I was not aware it was sized for a young child. I bought this for my mother, and when I tried it on it would not even fit my wrist, and i have small wrists.",2
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Penguin",2 year old granddaughter loves it! Holds many of her favorite things. Easy to carry around. Cute owl face and colorful.,5
Babys First Christmas 2012 Hallmark Ornament,"There weren't too many nice 2012 girl baby's first Christmas ornaments to be had and what there was is over priced. This is a typical, nice Hallmark ornament... $20+ for it is very steep... supply and demand I suppose.",4
Tie Necktie #159 Month Stickers for Bodysuit Boy Blue Green Brown,These were very cute! The new Mom & Dad were happy which is a plus! I can't wait to see them put to use.,4
"Lassig Tender Multi Pocket Diaper Bag ,cognac","Ever since I saw this bag I wanted it.I am 5 months pregnant and I knew that I wanted a diaper bag that was functional, simple, and didn't scream I'M A DIAPER BAG! This bag fits the bill. I was even contemplating using it as a work bag until baby comes. (But...I thought that it would be a little strange.)I don't have a baby yet, so I can't review it on its functionality yet, but here are my top pros and cons:PROS:-Sleek, beautiful, neutral-Easy, one-handed zipper pulls-Solid construction-Nice size - it is a large bag, but isn't strangely huge-Anti-microbial changing pad and zip pocket-Free from chemicalsCONS:-Random contrast colors. I have seen this bag in several pictures, all with a variety of contrast colors (blue, purple, and yellow). I was assuming I was going to get a contrast color at random and I got the yellow. I'm not disappointed, but I do wish that there would have been an ordering option when it came to this aspect.",4
"Luvable Friends Diaper Tote Bag, Brown, Large","I wasn't sure what quality this bag would be, but when it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised. It is a sturdy bad and well organized. It has 2 sections and a small zippered pocket inside. There is a pocket on the back and 2 elastic pockets on the sides where I carry bottles. The 2 pockets on the front are also very handy for a wallet, cell, etc. The changing pad that came with it is thicker than other ones that come with some diaper bags. The only downside is that the inside zippered pocket just tore. But, I had it full of stuff. Overall, I am enjoying using this bag every day. Plus, I think the brown one is super cute!",5
Safety 1st Finger Pinch Guard,"These finger guards are fantastic.  As a child, I had multiple finger nails taken off in doors, and one incident that required stitches, so I am very safety conscious when it comes to doors and fingers.This product works fantastic if 1) you place it high up on the door so the child cannot take it off and chew on it or lose it and 2) yes, I suppose if you have solid wood doors, and happen to leave your windows open to slam the doors shut, they may tear...so keep tornado-force winds out and close your windows (which should be also baby-proofed).Also, if one has an overly aggressive or older/stronger child that puts their full force on the door, knowing the finger guard is there, I can see how it may break because it is just a high-density foam.  However, this is just a safety product for toddlers and little kids...if you have a kid who fits the other description...then this isn't for you...and niether are any other baby-proofing product - because it's for babies - not high-force winds slamming doors or older kids/adults tearing them.",5
Babykins Hand Knitted Patchwork Baby Blanket (Beige),Not impressed.  I got it for my grandson because I didn't have time to knit one.  Not what I was expecting.,3
"Stork Craft Aspen Combo Dresser Chest, Natural",This is a really pretty changing table. However the wood is so soft it scratches. The changing pad I used left large deep scratches on the top. The handles didn't fit the screws that came with the dresser. So the handles fall off frequently. I gave the dresser the 2 stars because of the soft wood and handles/nobs that don't stay on. The color matched the discription and it's very sturdy.,2
Philips AVENT Straw Cups 9oz 12m+ - Pink,"It's a pretty good straw cup but occasionally it will leak, the liquid will come up the straw by itself. I found that opening the cup helps with this issue. Also separating the cover that spins and protects the straw and the lid is challenging at times. Overall it's fairly easy to clean.",3
"Britax Kick Mats (2-Pack, Black)","I really enjoy this item, as it definitely helps to keep the back of the seat clean, especially when my kids have muddy sneakers.  The only issue is that I wish these were a little wider or could wrap around the sides of the seats more.  My son is still able to put his feet up on the side of where the kick mat is, getting the sides of the seat wet / muddy.  I just have to keep telling him if he wants to put his feet up, he needs to put them up on the actual mat, so it's not a huge problem, just a comment I wanted to mention.",4
Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Bottle Newborn Feeding Set,"I love these bottles. They work just as they should. Yes, they are a pain in the butt to clean.. Seriously time consuming, but well worth it. My only complaint is that you can't buy replacement lids (not nipple caps, but the screw on lids) and the singular bottles dont come with those lids. They ONLY come in these full packs of bottles. Also, it is very hard to get the sour milk smell out of the rubber part of the inside piece. Even soaking them in soapy water, vinegar, nor baking soda and water overnight will never entirely get rid of it. I guess the trick is to never let them sit for more than 24 hours without washing them? I know that certainly helps. Also, taking a q-tip to that piece of the bottle helps a LOT! I would suggest doing that at least one a week. Those bottle brushes that come with the bottles don't get that rubber piece clean enough. All this is worth my baby boy not being gassy and feeding with ease though, especially late at night!",5
Avent Straw Cup - 9 oz - Boy - 2 pk,These cups were the perfect step after the bottle for our son. Easy enough for him to use by himself and leak proof,5
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","These bottles are a Godsend! I have an 8 week old, and he has only spit up about 5 or 6 times since he was born. Even then, it was because he had drank too much formula (more than usual), and I didn't get him to burp before laying him down. I have three other children, with the younger being 9, and they didn't have these then. I can definately see the difference. No spitting up alot, less gas, less burping, and your baby will be easier to burp.For those of you complaining about the time it takes to wash and assemble while the baby crys. Why don't you prepare a days worth of formula and bottles? I prepare my formula every night, fill the bottles, and refrigerate them. Then when my little one is hungry, I get one out of the fridge, and put in the bottle warmer. I do it at night to make sure I have plenty for night time feedings. Then, when your down to maybe one bottle, soak all your bottles and parts in hot sudsy water, clean, and fill them all back up again. Surely no one is so lazy that they can't wash and prepare bottles once a day? It's worth it to me, because I have a happier baby, and because of that I'm happier too. You can get a whole lot more sleep at night if baby's tummy isn't hurting.",5
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"I thought these spoons would be good, for the price. These spoons are GREAT, despite the price! They hold a good amount of food. I don't have an issue with them being backend heavy. But I would change that the backend of the spoon is pointy -- my daughter loves to put that side in her mouth & if we're not very diligent, poke herself in the back of the throat with it.",5
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"In an effort to make a stable and sturdy sleeper they forgot to make it comfortable for the baby.  We loved it for the stability  and size, but it was not comfortable for our baby and she has refused to stay asleep in it.  Not comfortable for her.",3
"Baby Brezza One Step Baby Food Maker, White/Grey","I just used this for the first time to make my daughter's first few batches of baby food.  Absolutely love it!  It assembles and disassembles super easily, and cleans perfectly in the dishwasher.  It is so nice to set it and forget it....once the steam cycle is complete it purees on it's own!  You can also use it just to steam veggies and fruits for older babies.  I was actually told to look into some of the other baby food processors, but so glad I decided to go with my gut and get the Baby Brezza!",5
"Serta Perfect Start Crib Mattress, White",I was able to purchase both of my grandbabies matressess for the price of one. Will definatly purchase from again.,5
Jellycat Bashful Plum Bunny Medium,"Love Jellycat products! Especially the Lovey Blankets for newborns because they don't just have heads, they have the body of the whole animal. This one is such a pretty plum color!",5
"Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat, Lamont","My daughter was 12 months old when she grew out of her infant car seat. This seat came fast and I like the quality, and she loves it. My only complaint is that if you are trying to follow the recommendation of keeping your kid rear facing until they are 2 then this seat is almost impossible to install correctly rear facing! We have a Toyota 4runner with lots of space and I actually ended up taking it to the local police department to have it professionally installed! You see, my husband and I spent forever trying to secure it, we watched the videos, read the instructions, used a towel, EVERYTHING, but it still would wiggle more then 1 inch at the base. I am pretty paranoid with it being installed correctly, so maybe most people wouldn't care that it would wiggle more then 1 inch, but we could seriously slide it back and forth way too much. Plus, when we did get it somewhat tight enough the recline wasn't right so her head would flop forward when she fell sleep in the car. I seriously had to reach back and hold her head up while she slept the whole 25 minutes home!The certified person at he police department spent 30 minutes installing it into my car. It looked like she was in a wrestling match, she was seriously bouncing on it and using all of her body weight and had to try it about 6 times before she got it right.  Well, my problem is now that it is installed perfectly I obviously don't want to take it out, but my mother-n-law watches her once a week...so the certified car seat person recommended buying a really cheap (but safe) car seat for grandma's car...so it looks like I am going to go buy a $50 car seat from Wal-Mart. I just keep telling myself that once we can  turn it around all these problems disappear, but wow it may be a long year. I may sound extreme, but I am willing to do whatever it takes for her to be safe in her car seat, getting in a bad accident is my biggest fear!",4
The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Mosaic Marble - Certified Baltic Amber &amp; Resin Baby Teething Necklace - w/The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),"I love these necklaces! My son was miserable and within several hours of wearing this he calmed right down. He has had it on for 5 months now! He is starting to notice it now and trying to chew it, not enough for me to be concerned though:)",5
"Boon Frog Pod Bath Toy Scoop,Green","I got this when my first daughter was born and did not hang it for a couple of years.  I finally learned about the suction plate for hanging it without using stickers, and we've been using this ever since.  It's a great product, and it makes cleaning up and drying bath toys really easy.  We've been using it for about three years now, and there's no sign of mildew or discoloration on this or any of the toys.  I'm really pleased with this thing, and I expect it to be in use for many years to come.",5
Sealy Baby Firm Rest Crib Mattress,Good mattress and my baby loves to sleep on it.Very good quality. I hope every one will enjoy when  buy it.,5
"BOB Sport Utility Duallie Stroller, Orange","I love this stroller, I use it multiple times everyday with my twins.  I chose this stroller because I had bought the BOB revolution for my first and loved it. BOB stroller are so well made, they are durable and high quality... definitely worth the money, so I knew I wanted a Duallie. But I didn't want to pay the extra 100 plus for a swivel wheel. In retrospect I definitely wish I had and think it would have been worth it.  Be prepared to get some major triceps due to all the pushing down on the handle bar to turn the big stroller. It is huge, but that's a good thing, lots of room for the the kiddos. I don't jog with this stroller, but I do use it on trails and the beach and everything in between. If you want a mall stroller, do not buy this one. Invest in something smaller with a swivel wheel FOR SURE!",4

"Gro-Egg Color Changing Digital Room Thermometer, White",This gro egg works perfectly! I love that I can see the color while I'm too far away to read the temperature. We bought it to use in a baby room that needs additional heat. We tested the actual temp using a room thermometer and it was spot on. I would recommend this product to anyone!,5
Safety 1st Froggy &amp; Friends No Slip Mat,"I wish I had read the reviews for this tub mat before purchasing. What a waste of money, when we give our daughter a bath, it literlaly FLOATS in the water and is making the tub more dangerous w/it than without so we chucked it last night and are going to get a new one. We were hoping for a fun design for the lil one but safety wins out.",1
"Prince Lionheart weePOD, Green","Save yourself the trouble with all others and buy this one! Fits elongated toilets fabulous! Soft and keeps my toddler securely on it. The pee guard isn't huge, but I taught my son to point it down so I don't have to mop every day! If the pee guard was huge, it would be in the way. Great product!",5
Vulli Chan Pie Gnon Natural Rubber Teether - Blue Chan,"This toy is too soft for my teether. My baby is really looking for something that they can ""sink their gums into"". This toy is a soft, thin, rubber, squeaky toy, there really isn't a lot to it. Yes it is light weight, but we need a harder surface since my baby still prefers to munch on my thumb knuckles,(which is starting to be a bit much) than this toy. If your baby is really looking for something to really chomp on, this toy is way too flimsy, and NOT the toy for you, keep looking.POSTSCRIPT:This toy has become on of my baby's favorite AFTER his teeth have started ""sprouting""it's soft enough to not irritate sensitive gums ,yet swishy enough to provide the chewiness required. Great for after 5 months.",3
"Graco Blossom Booster Seat, Brown/Tan",I bought this for my granddaughter since she had outgrown her other seat. She is 3 1/2 years old and weighs around 38 pounds right now. There is LOTS of room for her to grow so she will be using it a long time. It is very easy to connect the straps to the chair too.,5

Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet Tea,"We have a Baby Trend playyard, and these sheets fit perfectly.  I only use the sheets when we're traveling and my son uses the playyard to sleep in, and I haven't had any problem with the sheets coming off during sleep (and he's pretty active at night!).I will agree that these sheets are lint magnets.  Also, they're not the softest sheet in the world, but that does make them a bit more durable.  However, since we just use them at night, I would have liked a bit softer sheet.  The sheet is also quite thin.The best thing is to not have high expectations for this sheet.",3
"Jeep Wrangler Twin Sport All-Weather Stroller, Heat",I like everything about it except underneath it doesn't have a basket or carrier to put things while I'm walking,4
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,Bought this online as changing pads in the UK all seem to be 70cm long and I wanted one that was 80cm long. The shape and comfort are great. One thing to note is that it has a slight green tinge to it (the inner foam is green and it shows through the light cover) so you may have to buy or make (what we did) an additional cover for it.,4

"Fisher-Price Cradle n Swing, My Little Lamb","We have been using this swing for our newborn son who is now almost 5 weeks old. He really loves the swing. In fact, he has reflux so it's the only place he will sleep since he can't lay flat in his crib. He seems to really enjoy the mirror and rotating mobile above as well. We removed the tray completely since he won't be using it any time soon. It's easier to get him in and out without it there. The fabrics are very soft and fluffy, but can get kind of hot for the baby in summer. Although my son seems to really like the swing, there are a few things I wish I could change about it.1) It swings SUPER fast, even on the lowest setting. My husband and I thought ours was broken at first because we can't tell any difference between the lowest and the highest setting.2) I wish the headrest was detachable so we could wash it separately without having to remove the entire seat cover. As I mentioned before, my son has reflux and spits up a lot. Mostly it just gets on the headrest part, but it's a real bummer to have to remove everything since it's all one piece. And then my son can't use the swing until the laundry is done, and it's the ONLY place he'll sleep right now. (I've contemplated cutting the headrest part off with scissors to make my life easier.) However, I will mention it's relatively easy putting the seat cover back on, and I like that it is machine washable.3) The swing motor is quite noisy. It makes a loud clicking-type sound each time the swing is at it's highest on both sides. And on ours, the mobile squeaks loudly as it rotates (maybe we could just use some WD-40??). The noises don't seem to bother or wake my son, though. His big sister is much louder than the swing and he can sleep though her noise no problem.4) I wish it had a plug instead of only batteries. But other similar models have that feature, and ours seems to be doing good on battery life.If I could change those things, I would love this swing. But I suppose none of those things even matter because my son seems to love the swing and sleeps well in it. I guess that's what really matters anyways!",3

Music Lamp Projection Calendar Clock with Backlight Music Alarm Clock,"I bought this item as a way for my 4 yr old daughter to get excited about waking up for school.

"Nuby 2-Pack 10 oz No-Spill Cup with Flexi Straw, Colors May Vary","If I can't figure these cups out, how can my little one figure them out?

The instructions were vague and I plan on either returning these or donating them, although I would hate to bring this frustration onto anyone else!",1
Levana Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery and Talk to Baby Intercom,"We really like this monitor to keep an eye on the baby.  You can add additional cameras, but be sure to get the right one.  There are a couple that state they are compatible with the Jena, but only camera model # 32112 is compatible with it.  The Vox feature which turns the monitor on sound is detected and the temperature setting is nice as well.  Overall - a great value.",4

I mean, you have to keep shaking until all formula is poured.This one is highly recommended!",5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow",I looked at many different mats.  I was considering getting one off of Craigslist even because you can get them so cheap.  I decided to get this one and I am so glad I did.  My 6 week old loves it! It didn't take him long to realize he was able to make music with kicking.  The toys dropped down low enough for him to reach.  I love the mirror.  I love how versatile the mat/toy is.  I think he will be interested in playing with it longer than he would have with other mats as well making it a great value.  I would recommend to friends.,5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"You don't need this extra hassle with bathing a little one.  Our tub has leaked from day one.  I've even taken it apart and put it back together several times.  It's leaked when we bathe him in this tub inside our tub, on the counter, or wherever we put it (even with pushing down in the ""correct"" places to help the suction).  The sling also does pop out a lot.My husband is ready to throw it out he gets so frustrated with it.  By the time you fill up the tub and get the baby undressed, about an inch of water has leaked out.At four months, my son already stretches to the end of the tub and puts his feet over the edge.  He really likes to do it, but both my husband and I feel as though he's already outgrowing it.The tub is easy to clean.  The sling is very convenient.  My son loves his bathtime, but the little issues with the tub drive us crazy.  I'd recommend seriously purchasing another tub - especially one that is all one piece so you don't have to worry about anything leaking out the seams.",1

Lifefactory Glass Baby Bottles 4 Pack (4 oz. in Girl Colors),One of the elementary lunch ladies told my younger child not to bring the Evenflo Classic 4oz glass bottles I've been sending for the last 3+ years (I did not use a sleeve and I only had one break once because my older child was likely too rough with the lunch bag). I thought of the 8oz Lifefactory bottle I had and bought these with instead with the flat caps. The flat caps are easier to grip and clean than the Evenflo Classic ones and the bottles are great and cute! :),5

"Kiddopotamus Dreamsie Sleeper with Sleeves Microfleece Large, Ivory","The best sleeping bag for a baby EVER! I live in Seattle (actually Bellevue, a suburb) and it does get chilly. Our nursery can get in the mid to low 60's, and when a babe wont keep blankets on - this was a lifesaver. The value is great, for less than $20, you get a fleece warm all over blanket! If you live in the warmer states, this may be too much for you - but we used it with a fleece baby sleeper (the kind with the feet built in).",5
"Graco Affix Backless Youth Booster Seat with Latch System, Sailor",I simply like this because I think these are safer because they are attached to the frame of the car and othere ones are not.,5

Fisher-Price Calming Waters Vibration Bathing Tub,"We love this tub.  We've been using it for six months (our son is a little over six months old now).  Our first experience with the tub was doing a sponge bath in the sling.  Our son was not a fan of that.  After awhile we added water to the tub while he was still in the sling.  This was much more pleasing for him.  Once he grew out of the sling, bath time might be his happiest time of the day.  He loves the vibrartion.  He will splash in the tub for long stretches of time.  Sometimes we just let him splash, spend less time bathing and more time letting him have fun.  We will be a little sad when he's able to situp in the full size tub and have to retire this one.  Have never had any problems with this.  Love that you can hang it to dry.  Is easy to fill and empty.  The headrest is pretty flimsy, but baby never complains.  Highly recommended!!",5
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small","Provides a secure place for the dirty/wet diapers. Keeps the smells in, doesn't leak, doesn't take up space in the diaper bag, cute enough to carry on its own if you ever needed to and washes great! I just need 1 more now!",4

Kwiki Purse Insert Organizer KHAKI Medium by BagnBasket,"I have a couple other varieties of the purse inserts and none of them compare to the support of this one and I am really happy with my Kiwi, I wish this would have been my first choice.The Kiwi purse insert is very sturdy, not flimsy by any means and I love using it in my shapeless handbags. The khaki color is the best as the light color makes it's easy to find the items you look (dig) for, especially inside black or dark colored handbags. The Kiwi contains so many pockets in a variety of sizes to hold practically everything you would put in a purse and the middle opening is large enough for my checkbook, picture wallet, digital camera (while in it's leather case) & my Ipod classic with still some room left. Love, love, love the medium insert and although it fits perfectly for my mid-size bags, it is on the small side when used with my over-sized ones and tends to get lost inside. You will definitely need the large if you carry a large / oversized purse.",5
Baby Einstein Links,"My 7 month old loves these, especially banging them against his crib rails.  He's been using them since he was about 4 months old and I they are nice and easy to grip.  Great to chew on too!  They are also useful for hanging things from carriers/strollers, etc.",5
Safe-er-Grip 17&quot; Bathtub and Shower Handle and Shower Foot Rest,"The footrest is larger than I expected, but seems fairly sturdy. In about 3 weeks of use it hasn't fallen off the wall yet. My only regret is that it is somewhat unsightly if your shower walls are anything other than white.",4
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Newborn Napper, Melbourne","We got this a few weeks before our son was born to serve as a bassinet. It's definitely served its purpose! He loves the napper station. That's usually where he sleeps ALL the time...not just for naps haha.The vibration, music and nature sound features are all awesome and there's plenty of storage space when you're using the top half for sleeping. One thing to remember when purchasing this item: you need sheets! I didn't think about it. Thank god my mom reminded me before the baby arrived!All in all we love this thing!",5
"DaVinci Kalani 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","I am very happy with the crib, but wish it would have come with plugs for the screw holes - they're very evident when assembled.  I'll either fill them or plug them myself, but for about $0.12 they could have found a way to satisfy my aesthetic needs and any safety concerns concerning little plastic pieces.Assembly was pretty straight-forward and not too difficult.  The finish on the one I received was very good and in good shape - it didn't ding or mar too easily while assembling.",5
Fisher-Price Private Connection Monitor with Dual Receivers - White and Grey,"This monitor has been nothing but trouble for us.  The battery life is terrible.  It can charge all day, and by 5am, it is beeping from low battery already!  The beeping is so scary the first few times you hear it!  My daughter has been sleeping 9 hours since she was 2 1/2 weeks old, and the monitor's battery didn't last as long as she did.  I had to get up and change the monitor to the other one that was charging.  Ridiculous!Now we are having problems getting them to turn on.  My daughter is only 11 weeks old, so the monitors are fairly new.  We have to turn them on and off about 15-20 times before they will turn on.  If you are shopping around for monitors, I would suggest a different one.  Good luck!",1

"HALO Early Walker SleepSack Lightweight Knit Wearable Blanket, Blue, Large","We've been using HALO sleep sacks since our some was born in June 2013. Every one of them has been well made and fit him as expected. However this one is not only grossly oversized, the quality just isn't the same. The stitching in a few areas looks like this was a trainee's practice sleep sack and the fabric isn't smooth and has pilled.When he outgrew the medium sleep sacks, you'd think the large size would fit him, but it was so long that it dragged on the floor making it impossible for him to walk in this. The fleece one we also bought is just as large, but at least the quality is satisfactory. Perhaps a medium walker sleep sack is the next step from a medium sleep sack without feet. If this is the case, it would be helpful if HALO updated the sizing on their website.",3
"Nuby 10 Pack Hangers, Colors May Vary","I am not sure what the confusion is for from the other reviewers. There are 10 hangers in a pack for the price listed.

I am very pleased with them and would purchase more without a doubt! And I definitely didn't find them cheaper anywhere else!",5

North States Superyard 3 in 1 Wood Gate,"It is super easy to put together, beautiful, the gate seems to operate in a way my little one will not be able to figure out, once you make the shape you want and tighten to lock each corner in place it is very sturdy. I have no comment about attaching to walls.My complaints are: it is very expensive and you need to at least buy 1 extension (ideally 2). The space the original superyard provides is way too small.I have used it (with 1 extension) with my 8 month old for a few days now and am pleased with my choice.",4
"Chicco Smart Support Backpack, Red","So I find myself only writing reviews for products that I don't think we could live without.  The Chicco Smart Support backpack is definitely one of those items.  We are currently traveling in strange places (for instance, we're currently in Uzbekistan).  But even in Europe, sidewalks and elevators are not the norm.  So we needed something to carry our baby (currently 10 months).  We got both this and the Ergo.  Everyone said the Ergo was a lifesaver... well, our son definitely prefers the Chicco.  He can peer over the side or our shoulder and watch everything.  He even takes naps in it (like for an hour!).  My husband likes using it for the convenience factor and likes the lowerback support.  I have used it only a few times and it is comfortable but it is definitely heavier than the Ergo and made for someone taller than 5'5.  We would buy this pack over the Ergo any day...",5

Skip Hop Zoo Playspot,"The paint peels off the tiles and my daughter ate it. A Skip Hop representative told me they've been trying to revise the paint formula but it still peels. Nevertheless, they still sell these, with full knowledge of the problem. Also, I was horrified to discover that all EVA foam play mats contain some formaldehyde, which is carcinogenic. They can get away with calling mats formaldehyde-free in the US because our laws allow them to if it's under a certain level. Our safety standards are disturbingly minimal, and all EVA foam play mats have been banned in France and Belgium. I am getting rid of my Skip Hop play mat, and I realize because of low safety standards for toxins in the US, I have to research safe toys in order to keep my infant safe.",1
BRICA goPad Diaper Changer,Very nice diaper changer. It's a bit larger than I expected (about 12 inches X 6 inches or so) but it's good that it can detach into 2 parts so when taking a diaper bag I only need the change pad and when going out for a quick trip I can carry the entire changer in place of a diaper bag since it can hold all the essentials.,5

Snoogle Chic - Snoogle Total Body Pregnancy Pillow with Easy on-off Zippered Cover - Taupe Rings,If you are pregnant and have problems with your back (I was having some terrible sciatica problems) this pillow will help. I have used it every night since I purchased it. You won't regret it!,5
"FuzziBunz&reg; One Size Elite Cloth Diapers 12 Pack Gender Neutral Colors with Dainty Baby Reusable Bag Bundle, Colors May Vary","I have been using one-size FuzziBunz since my baby was born 6 months ago.  I had purchased 24 diapers before her birth, and then ordered 12 more a few weeks after her birth.  The 12 additional diapers I ordered were different from the other diapers I'd bought.  I was surprised by this, but kept them anyway because we needed them right away.  I really like my original one-size FuzziBunz diapers, but the 12 additional diapers have been a major disappointment.  I would like to share my thoughts regarding the changes that were made:- The minky inserts do seem to slide in easier than the microfiber ones when I'm assembling the diapers after each wash.- I really dislike that the adjustable elastic and buttons are now on the inside of the diaper.  This has made changing the size of each diaper a major pain (turn diaper inside out, adjust sizing, turn diaper right side out, stuff with inserts, try on baby, find out it's not quite right, pull out inserts, repeat process multiple times until I finally figure out a good setting).  Definitely way more time-consuming than adjusting our original FuzziBunz diapers!- My number one complaint and biggest frustration by far is the fact that the minky inserts aren't nearly as absorbent as the microfiber inserts of our other FuzziBunz diapers.  We only use the minky diapers as daytime diapers and, even then, I often have to change my baby's outfit because of urine leaks.  It seems the minky diapers don't last for more than an hour or so before they leak, so we only use them in between naps and try to avoid using them when we're away from the house.  And we don't dare use them overnight.When the diapers I have eventually wear out, I hope I will be able to find some of the original FuzziBunz to buy.  If not, I will have to figure out a different brand of cloth diapers to use.  I hope FuzziBunz will consider reinstating the features of the original diapers that were so much better than the newer version.",2
KidCo GoPod Portable Activity Seat - Pistachio,Our five month old at 97% for size was too small for the opening and needed towels folded around him...his two year old nephew climbed in and fit perfectly but was obviously too old and mobile to use.  I would suggest making the opening a little smaller and lowering the lowest setting so younger babies do no cause the material to collapse downward and inward.  Good design for quick folding and travel...I wish it was not made in China.,4
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I bought these bottles for my baby who is a big spitter.  They haven't helped at all, and one of them leaks like crazy all over the place.  I will be calling Playtex to request a refund.",1
"The First Years True Fit Convertible Car Seat, Monet","The First Years True Fit Convertible Car Seat 630 is NOT a good carseat for infants in the rear facing position. BEWARE you must have a very FLAT back seat to get the ""line level"" to work. We would have to stick a towel or 2 under the carseat to get it to be level...thats not very safe. Our old carseat by Evenflo had a nice level system built into the carseat, really disappointed by the ""line"" level for the First Years model. You CANNOT adjust the straps in the rear position because the carseat will not sit flat. Therefore it makes it really difficult to get my baby in and out of the carseat. We like to loosen the straps some before putting her in or out. The carseat would probably be alot better in the front facing position but we have a long way to go on that... we dont feel comfortable using the seat until then.The only pros i can say are the cushions are very comfy and the fabric is a nice color.SAVE YOUR MONEY for the newer model...sounds like alot more adjustable features etc.",1

"The First Years Gumdrop Newborn Pacifiers, Pink/Purple, 5-Count","I ordered these because my preemie baby loved pacifiers but I hated that they covered his nose. These don't, and he loves them. He's 4 months old and still uses them. I gave them 4 stars because it's a great value and I  like that his nose wasn't covered by them, but they're a rubbery material that everything sticks to. I have 2 dogs and I'm constantly picking dog hair and other random fuzzies off of them. That material just attracts everything. But overall, I love them!",4
Wabi Baby Electric Steam Baby Bottle Sterilizer and Dryer,This is one of those items you don't think you need until you get it. Saves me a bunch of time. I will wash the bottles and pump supplies and throw them in this to sterilize and dry. One hour later everything is ready for use. This is a lot easier and faster than boiling water and air drying them after. I use it at least once a day and only wish they made it bigger.,5

Soft Tip Weaning &quot;Here Comes Dinner&quot; Toddler Spoon Set (2 Pcs) with Transportation Sounds (Styles Vary),"Battery is one time use, cant be changed. And you can't pick which spoon you get. Kinda silly. I wasted money on this one. Wouldn't recommend.",2
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"I used these trays all the time when my daughter was younger and I still use them now (she's 15 months now)  I use them for making ground, seasoned turkey.  That way if I find myself in a time crunch I have perfect portions of pre-made meat on hand to throw into some pasta or other dishes.  Love them and definately recommend them to any mom...no complaints!",5
"Trend Lab Dr. Seuss Oh, The Places You'll Go 3 Piece Crib Bedding Set, Blue",im so very much happy about my buy! i love the powder blue which happens to be the color of his wall. its just perfect! the quailty was very nice and its just like it says on the info online.,5
"Tadpoles Playmat Set, Modern/Multi","The playmat is good for all ages. It is a little smaller than I expected, once it was put together on the floor. I wish the pieces fit a little tighter. When an adult walks across it, the pieces often break apart.",3
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"This is the second Sophie I've bought for a grandchild.  There is no beating this most loved friend.  The boys love teething on her and she is easy for them to hold.  When I was first introduced to Sophie my first thought was ""Are you kidding me....it looks like a toy I would have had as a baby.""  Boy, was I wrong!  Sophie Rules!",5
"Protect-a-Bub Single Compact Sunshade, Black","This is great, I love it.  It ties on with four ties, one at each corner and protect all but my son's feet in the stroller.  He does not mind it either.  It folds up easily and is light.  Definately one of my better purchases.",5
"Leachco Preggle Comfort Air-Flow Body Pillow, Ivory/Khaki","This particular body pillow is useful, but I think you can find comprable ones for less money.  I removed the cover to wash it and was never able to put the pillow back in.  The ""air flow"" feature isn't exactly that, but once the cover came off I found the pillow to be just fine without it.  The pillow actually helps with my carpal tunnel issues caused by pregnancy and I can use it to more or less sleep on my back without causing my blood pressure to go up.  All in all, I'm glad I bought it.",3
"Comfort Body Pillow, Full Body Pillow, Pregnancy Pillow, Nursing Pillow &amp; Sid...",breaks easily,2
Safety 1st Oven Front Lock,"I like this oven door lock for the most part, but believe it or not, my 14 month old daughter is slowly but surely figuring out how to unlock the handle. Granted, she's not your typical toddler; she has already taken apart door stops and even partially dismantled her baby swing. She's a very curious child who appears to be mechanically inclined. So a word of warning: if you have a similar child, you're probably better off with a more sophisticated lock. So far, the adhesive is holding up nicely, so there are no issues with that or any heat resistance issues. I still recommend this lock for general safety.",4
Disposable Baby Bibs 24 Count (4 bibs per package) - by Mighty Clean Baby,We always have these in the diaper bag. These really are very easy to use. They stand up to a lot of food spillage.,5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"My wife who is expecting was having troubles sleeping and now that she has this, she sleeps much better. When she gets up in the morning, i move over and sleep with it.Her only complaint is that it puts a divider between her and I. LOL.",5
"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch",The product was delivered faster than expected (very good) but not exactly according to what I expected.On the equipment manual it informs that the package come with the adapter to power supplie but it did not came with.Now I need to go to a store to buy it.,3
Mokingtop Fashion New Safe Shampoo Shower Bathing Bath Protect Soft Cap Hat For Baby Children Kids (Blue),we found this cap to be alittle to flimsy for my grandson and it was really alittle to small for him maybe if it was adjustable,3
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"The monitor has exceptional sound quality and very little interference in our home.  The problem is that it does not transmit sound unless there is a new noise.  So, if child is sleeping, you hear nothing.  When child is making a noise, you miss the beginning and then it will transmit for a few seconds before turning back to silent mode.  Very frustrating.  No way to make it keep transmitting. Battery life is much longer than our less expensive monitor.  To give you an idea, I was downstairs doing dishes while my wife and daughter were reading a bedtime story.  Monitor began to transmit sound and then went dead after a few seconds.  I worry that if we were sleeping, and missed the first noises, we could miss a middle of the night problem.  To get the monitor to start transmitting again, you have to hold down the talk button, stay quiet and then let it up a few seconds later hoping that transmitted noises to the child's room do not wake her up.  Would not buy again and plan to buy a cheaper monitor.",2
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","My milk took forever to come in, and my baby wouldn't nurse because of that. I had to buy a breastpump to do what my baby wouldn't, and I was wasting so much time and energy trying to pump. I thought this looked dorky, but after a week of pumping, I knew I had to try something. This worked like a dream! I could pump both breasts at once and I could bottle-feed my baby at the same time or read a book or work on my computer. It is very secure and I never feel like the breastmilk bottles will fall out. I'm actually going to get another one because it does get dirty from milk drips and I need another while this one is washing. But I LOVE this product. It is a must if you are going to do any pumping.",5
"Evenflo Nurture Infant Car Seat, Jenny","This carseat it adorable. I ordered it since we have a baby due in Septemeber, but as of now do not know what we are having. This is a perfect unisex carseat.",5
Fisher-Price My Little Snugabunny Newborn Rock n' Play Sleeper,"I added this to my gift registry and thought this would be a great item for a first time mom.  I loved this product.  My son was able to nap in it and enjoyed being involved as an infant while I was cooking or folding laundry.  It helped him keep his head up when he was very young bc it is at a nice angle.  Has a very comforting rock and doesn't seem to make him feel like he is falling, like some swings, he doesn't reach out and act startled.  Would definitely recommend this product, I would get it for a first time mom, esp if it wasn't on her registry.  I had two of my friends add it to their registry!  It is also easy to dismantle and wash :)",5
Fisher-Price Disney Baby Nemo Squirt Teether,"I bought this under the notion it was a teether but not really, it great to use as a distraction to hold thier attention for a minute but did not even get a bite from my little one.",3
"Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-on Placemats with Reusable Pop-up Travel Case, 50-Count",If you ever play on going out to eat with you child you need these. As valuable as their diapers!,5

"Hudson Baby Sheep Printed Blanket with Plush Backing, Pink","Very soft blanket. I was impressed with the quality. Less than $10 but feels and looks like a $30 blanket. Holds up great with multiple washes in the washer and dryer. Design side with the sheep is starting to &#34;pill&#34; up a tiny bit but I have washed it a lot, still very soft.",5
"Sunshine Kids Dry Seat Pad, Grey","I do like this. My son is in cloth diapers and occasionally he's at the age where he lets out a flood of urine and the diaper can't absorb it fast enough. Luckily, it hasn't happened yet since we've had our RXT. I do wish it came in coordinating colors. Shipping took a while and this was not on back order. That was very frustrating.",4
"Fisher-Price Space Saver Swing and Seat, Discover'N Grow","I only gave this one star only because how cute it was . That was it , it was cute ! Batteries in every corner of the darn thing and the swing never worked right . The little bar was trying too hard and the seat part never moved , And the baby was NOT in it ! Do not recommend this item and would not buy it again .",1
Playtex Sipster Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack (Colors Vary),"I have a 3 1/2 year old and a 1 1/2 year old and have had my fare share of sippy cups to use clean sometimes throw many away. I use to think that using the soft sippy cups  was a great transition from bottles..NOT!! these are the best they are easy to clean they dont leak everywhere and they hold the perfect amount of liquid. I have found that children with teeth chew on the soft tip and it is no longer leek proof which makes night time a big pain, anyways these are awsome and i defiantly recommend them. I got the purple and pink one since they very but i didnt mind its not like having a pink sippy cup makes my son gay or anything so people are so silly",5
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,The actual spoon part is really deep so my 8 month old has a hard time getting all of the food off of the spoon.  My toddler has no trouble with it but its not for babies.  I really love that they are super long though!,3
Westminster Hand Boilers (Colors May Vary),They are cute,3
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"This is a nice gate for the money. It is very light weight and could be dislodged by a larger child. It is only rated for children 6-24 months. I use it for dogs and one of the dogs was able to knock it over, but since it's not designed for dogs, I am not reducing the rating. It is easy to install and is easy to operate. I think most small children would be well contained using this product.",5
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","Okay well we were in for about 3 months before we started to really have alot of problems with the mobile. I am in LOVE with the mobile for sure but it is way too expensive. The reason I say that is because the batteries stopped working within the first 3 months. We changed the batteries and then right after that the light for the projection just stopped working all together which makes the entire mobile stop working. So paying 54.99 for this is WAYYYYY too much in my opinion b/c it does not have longevity at all. My daughter misses it, i can tell but it pisses me off b/c of the fact that she didnt even have it that long at all before it totally just stopped working all together.I would NOT recommend this to any of you guys. really. you will be really upset after  paying all this money for only a 2-3 month mobile. UGH. I am so angry over this.",3
"KF Baby Diaper Bag Insert Organizer (12 x 6.4 x 8 inch, Black) + Diaper Changing Pad Value Combo","This is the perfect organizer to put in any bag to convert it to a diaper bag!It is made from a thick material that stands up on its own, so it doesn't collapse in the bag.",5
Econobum Full Kit,"These Econobum diapers make cloth diapering affordable. I ended up using disposable diapers for my baby's first 3-4 months because these were just too bulky, I could barely get some of her pants on. I love them now though.",4
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"I really like this potty chair - the high back keeps kids from falling off the back, and the raised front is great for little boys. We had another chair but only the Bjorn seemed to be high enough to prevent a mess for our boys. I also have the shorter backed version, and they are both good for different reasons. This one feels a little sturdier, and the bucket is easy to empty. The non-skid on the bottom keeps it from sliding all around the floor.",5
Summer Infant Car Seat Mat,Our car has a cloth seat cover that kept coming off whenever we got out of the car. This was basically to keep the cloth seat cover from coming off. It works very well with an occasional repositioning. Worth the money to keep my seat covers protected and looking like new.,5
Medela Sleep Bra - Large Blue,I first purchased a Medela sleep bra when I was pregnant with my first baby 4 years ago and needed a little extra support.I found it to be so comfortable that I purchased several more and have slept in them ever since.  They make nursing easy and are so comfortable that you forget you're wearing it. Highly recommended! I even wear them when I am not pregnant or nursing now.,5
BOB Infant Car Seat Adapter for Graco Single Strollers,"I bought this product for our upcoming vacation as my husband and I want to travel through the airport with our BOB stroller.  I had difficulty finding an adapter that specifically stated it would fit the Chicco Key FIt Car Seat.  I purchased this product, despite the fact that it explicitly says it's for a Graco seat.  I did this because of the numerous reviews that stated the adapter fits beautifully with the Chicco seat.  This is NOT the case, however.  While easy to install and uninstall, it does not fit the Chicco.  You can put the car seat in this adapter and it will &#34;sit&#34; there.  However, it does not actually click into this adapter, therefore does not assure me that it would be safe to use with a Chicco car seat.  I will be returning this product and ordering the correct adapter through Target.  I'm sure if I had a Graco seat, this product would have been wonderful.  And I am sure the correct adapter will prove useful and a good investment, like all other BOB products I have purchased.  Just please be warned that the current reviews are not accurate.",1
Baby Einstein Bendy Ball,,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"I am currently watching my 5.5 month old play in the jumperoo.  He is laughing and bouncing away.  It is one of the few toys that holds his attention for any great amount of time.  He is currently on the 2nd lowest height setting (he is 27 inches).  I adjusted the height a couple of weeks ago - very easy to do.  When we first got it (about a month and a half ago)- it took a couple of tries before he really got into it, but now I can't imagine life without it.  When he first started, he didn't have the strength to rotate around - so I was pretty involved with his interaction, but now he has mastered it and loves all the items he can currently see and touch.  He doesn't quite have the strength/height yet to enjoy a couple of the toys (the elephant and rainbow disk), but I am okay with that since it will give him new things to do as he continues to grow.",5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I can't say enough about the Diaper Dekor Plus system.  It truly holds as many diapers ODOR free as they say it does.  Our son is 3 months old and we've only just opened a second bag a couple of weeks ago!  (Each box of refills contains 3 bags, but they include one bag when you purchase the Diaper Dekor Plus.)  At the rate we are going, we won't need to open another box of refills until close to his 6 month birthday.Don't let the price tag worry you - it's WELL worth the price because there is absolutely no odor.  With two dogs in the house, we worried that the diaper can would become a hunting ground, but they haven't shown the least bit of interest.  The bag is a cinch to dispose of, and I LOVE how you can cut it off at any point you want.  In the long run, the refills are much cheaper than the other brands and it's well worth the money to not have to waste your time on flimsy grocery-store bags - they simply can't contain the stink - find another use for them - line your other waste pails with them.  Diapers need special attention, and the Diaper Dekor Plus fits the bill!I HIGHLY recommend this stylish, practical and cost-effective disposal system!",5
Luvable Friends 3-Pack Embroidered Sayings Hooded Towels - Blue,"These are thinner than I thought they would be. However, they dry baby. These are better suited for a smaller baby (not my 20 lb and 26 in long one)",4
Munchkin Gone Fishin' Bath Toy,"From the product description it sounds like you can pick up all three bath toys at the same time which you can't.  Honestly the only one that picks up """"easily"""" is the fish.  The other two are kinda heavy and I find they drop off the fishing pole quite often.  My son likes it though so...",4
"NUK 2 Pack Classic Silicone BPA Free Fashion Pacifier, Size 1 (Colors may vary)","i was so excited to buy these because all of the stores around me are out of this size. when i opened the package i had the purple and pink ones, my SON  doesn't look to good in those colors. we will use them in the house but i wont use them in public. i wish we were able to pick the color we wanted.",1
"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch","Orig. review:Sound and video broke after a few months. It worked at first but now always displays out of range and hard to use. The control functions on the remote control do not function any more either. Do not buy this monitorUpdate:Samsung USA was able to replace the defective product. We have had the replacement monitor now for about a month and a half and have been very happy so far.  Video and audio is sharp and product has been reliable thus far.  In the interim period between monitors, tried two other companies' products and was not happy with screen size or features.  Overall. Samsung has the best package in terms of all around well-rounded product.",5
8 inch My First Puppy Small - Pink,"My daughter loves this! Perfect size for a toddler and the puppy is very soft. We ordered two, since she already one she was attached too!",5
"My Brest Friend 3 Pack Premium XL Burp Cloths, Pink","When you have a baby that spits up, a lot, these are great! They are a little on the large size, reminds me more of a dish towel size. All in all they are super absorbent and do exactly what they're meant to do.",5
Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,"I bought this for our Graco Pack and Play. It worked excellent. Both my daughters, now ages 1 and 3 love it. My one year old used the pack and play as a bed until she was 8 months old and slept excellent on this mattress.  I noticed a few parents complaining that there is a slight gap on one side - it's not a ""perfect fit"". If a parent was nervous about it they could roll a towel and stick it under the crib sheet to make it a perfect fit. All and all it makes the pack and play much more like a bed than a play pen.",5
ReSqueeze Reusable Food Pouch (4-pack),"My little girl loves these!  From day one she hasn't wanted to let it out of her hands, she loves the design on the pouch too!  It has made meal time so much easier for me now that she can feed herself, leaving me free to eat my own food!! Yay!  I love the convenience of being able to pack it around in the diaper bag.  We use it for applesauce, yogurt, and I even transfer jar food into the pouch (it's cheaper than buying the one-time use pouches, and I don't have to spoon feed her!)The product itself is high quality, doesn't leak, and holds a good serving size for little ones!  I will definitely be buying more of these for myself and for my friends!  Perfect baby shower gift, or present for a first birthday!!",5
Mud Pie Baby Princess &quot;Baby Girl&quot; Spoon and Fork Set,"Purchased for my precious baby Granddaughter...love it!  Her mommy wasn't so pleased that it couldn't go in the dishwasher, but some things just need a little extra care.  She gets a kick out of the &#34;pretty&#34; silverware.  :-)",5
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free Cool Twisties Insulated Straw Cup, 9 Ounce, Single Pack, Colors May Vary","I purchased this last week for my daughter and it's the worst sippy cup we have ever owned! My baby has to suck really, really, really hard to get the milk out (I tried this myself so I know) then when she finishes drinking and takes the straw out of her mouth she gets squirt in the face with the milk. Poor baby, I looked at her and her face and hair were covered with milk. The should call it a ""Squirty Cup"" (not sippy) I would not recommend wasting money on this cup even though it is cute!",1
Seed Organic Natural Pod Cradle,"I ordered this to replace another moses basket I'd been given--that one had a funky chemical smell, and I was willing to pay a little more for something that didn't seem to be off-gassing. However there are several problems with this product.First, it comes with only one sheet to cover the latex pad, and because the pad is longer than standard bassinet size, it's not easy to figure out suitable alternatives. The cleaning instructions for that sheet are to hand wash and hang to dry (only). Second, the ""organic"" label applies to the sheet and basket cover, but it all comes from China and I suspect that the ""natural"" maize of the basket itself was subjected to pesticides... or at least I have no way of knowing otherwise and so don't feel very reassured on that front. Finally, some of the veneer started to split off of the stand when my husband screwed it together.It looks cute enough, and we still plan to use it, but I don't think it's worth the money, and I wouldn't recommend it.",2
Kushies 5 Pack Reusable Ultra Diapers for Infants,"These diapers are okay for use until your child can roll over or crawl.  It seems that no matter which way I stick the straps they still allow leaks up the tummy.  These diapers have held up pretty well for the 5 months I used them, but now the velcro is starting to pill and it seems that you could probably pull the the velcro off of the diaper if you take the straps off too fast.  Also, I can't figure out if it may just be our water but these diapers have developed these odd orange stains where the seam of the outer layer and inner layer meet.  This doesn't effect the function of the diaper but I can't help but wonder what it is.  These also cannot last an overnight without a doubler.Overall these have been sturdy and might last through a couple of kids.  You have to watch the leaks during ""tummy time"" but a doubler can fix this issue.  This is a good cost effective approach to an all-in-one but for us we are trying other diapers now that our son has grown out of these.Overall these",4
"Born Free 2 Handles for Cup and Bottle, Colors May Vary",what can I say more than my kids like the handles.  I would not purchase the Born Free Cups in the future (I have many complaints but the handles are not one of them).,4
"Gund Baby Crashing Hammer Sound Rattle, Red, 8.5&quot;","I have 3 grandchildren and 2 more due in 2009.  I previously bought a hard plastic hammer shaped rattle as a gift when they were born.  That particular rattle is no longer in production.  I found the Gund Hammer on an internet search and it was perfect.  It is soft, entertaining for a baby, and just the right size.  Perfect!",5
"Graco Highback TurboBooster Car Seat, Spitfire","My 3 1/2 year old likes it better than her My Ride 65 because it give her more leg room.  She says it is comfortable and is able to see outside better than in her old seat.  She also like that she can get in and out of it easier.  It has stayed in place even without the latch system, the seat belt guide holds it pretty steady when my daughter is not in the seat.  She is still getting used to the seat belt so she sometimes complains about that, but the seat belt guide is good and adjusts the seat belt where it needs to be, just a 3 1/2 year old getting used to something new.",4
2 in 1 Professional Clinical RY230 Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead and Surface,"I opened the package,  read the instruction and still cant figure out how to make it work.  I had an elderly neighbor read the instructions also.  neither one of us could figure out how to make it work.I got it because I live with my elderly mother and didn't want to use a mouth thermometer.  I thought this would be perfect.I hate when I have to be smarter than a product  in order to use it.",3
The First Years Breastflow Milk Storage Organizer,"The Lansinoh bags do not fit in this container. You have to put them in on an angle and can only fit about 7-10 in there. As long as the bag is sealed, just go to the dollar store and get an ice cube tray or a plastic drawer organizer and use that.",1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","We have two large and one small dog, and were worried that a stand-alone high chair might get knocked about.  This seat is portable, easy to clean, and never in danger of being tipped over.  It straps to the chair and still slides under the table.  We store the tray in between the seat back and the chair.  We do not use the white tray or the green lid.Our daughter is now 8 months old, and knows that the chair means FOOD,  It's nice that we can bring it places and she will still know what is going on, because it's familiar to her.Be careful about the little fingers getting pinched though!  We had two pinching incidents, but now our daughter has learned that when we put down the tray and say &#34;Hands up,&#34; she gets her arms out of the way.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I purchased this rocker for my grandson when he was one month old - he's 4 months old now.  And he sits in the rocker almost every day to watch his Baby Einstein videos.  When he has an upset stomach, the vibrations seem to help him work it out!  I had researched different seats before purchasing this one and am 100% happy with it.  I assembled the rocker myself, and didn't have any problems understanding the directions.",5
"OXO Tot 4-Piece Feeding Set, Green","Very good products! Excellent quality, the spoon and fork are very easy to use by a toddler, the bowl is great for cereals. They indeed stay on the table and don't move.",5
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"My 2 1/2 year old was ready for potty training and we love his potty seat at home (which also sits on the toilet but is for all day use), but we are on the go quite a bit so we bought this potty seat.  He loves to use it!  It's compact enough for a diaper bag (or backpack which we use) and it worked great at Disney World.  It's pretty darn sturdy too.  I've even set it up in his carseat for him to go in a compact car.  Yeah, it's not as sturdy as a free standing training potty, but it's not meant to be kept at home on the ground for use all day.  I love that it sits on top of a toilet as well, which made potty training during a hotel visit a piece of cake.  I do NOT recommend buying additional bags.  A plastic grocery bag with a paper towel works just as well.  Just be sure to check the bag for holes first and have them ready to go in the car.",5
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"This is such a clever design for a bib. The fact that it is all plastic helps with cleaning away the food and instant drying. The little scoop at the bottom catches any food that may fall while feeding your child. This beats the stuborn stains that may fall on the floor, your child's clothes or your own.",5
"Graco SnugRide Click Connect 35 Car Seat, Tangerine","I got this as part of a package with the FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Stroller.  It's very simple to lock into the car-seat base and stroller as all you have to do is line it up and snap it in.  To take it out, you simply squeeze a latch on the back of it while you're picking it up.  The straps on the 5-point harness are also easy to adjust, but need to be loosened and tightened every time you put your LO in or take them out of the carseat.  The canopy is a nice addition, but I wish it would come forward just a little further to keep the sun out of our LOs eyes.  Overall, a good buy.",4

"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","I could not be happier with this car seat. Installation was simple, even into a car that did not have LATCH brackets. My son appears quite comfortable in the seat. Restraints are snug, easy to adjust, and simple to use even with a squirming baby. Getting the carrier in and out of the base is also a snap.The product feels solidly constructed. This was one of my reasons for purchasing this car seat over competitors. Some others just felt rather flimsy or poorly made. You pay a slight premium for this one, but it's worth it.",5
Britax Vehicle Seat Protector,Brilliant at protecting leather seats and giving that extra grip to stop the car seat sliding even a little. Recommend it really is good.,5
"Carters Super Soft Bumper, Pink","third kid and just couldn't keep reusing the same grungy bumpers. these are very soft, and affordable. doubtful they wash well and surely the ties will come off but as a mom who purchased extremely expensive, custom baby bedding the first go-round, they ALL lose their ties and don't wash well. also if you're a nervous mom (which i'm not) you can buy these for when you baby is up and crawling around the crib vs during infancy (when she's going nowhere and there's more of a risk of CIDS). when your baby is fat, turning over, rolling around and you have crib slats - you'll find she gets her legs stuck in between the slats without bumpers. and then she will cry. loudly. you can also string sheets as a cheap solution to prevent this but honestly - just get these. they work, they're tall and they're soft!",5
"SugarBooger Zippee BackPack, Retro Robot",I love the print an quality of the bag.  The fabric is a little light for toddlers because it gets dirty but washes up nicely.,5
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Cuddle Cove Rocking Seat, Winslet",I purchased this for my daughter for her baby shower. It's adorable with plenty of storage. It serves many purposes that can change as the baby grows.,5
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue","I love how the 5 month old can safely play in the activity jumper while the 2 year old can play on the outside. Their mommy declared, &#34;This is the first &#34;toy&#34; they can play with together! It is huge that is the only downfall.",4

VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,"I received this baby monitor as a gift and I have been using it every night for the past 7 months since my baby was born. It has been working great and does the job, but about a month ago the screen stopped showing the text and symbols. It still lights up but I can't use any of the menu functions. It says there's a one year warranty so hopefully I can get it exchanged. And hopefully the next one lasts longer!",3
The First Years Disney Pixar Cars  Rev and Go Potty System,"I got this for my little granddaughter because she loves the Disney princesses and because it has a 'cushy tushie' seat.  Unfortunately, the design is flawed because invariably urine finds its way around the drop-in potty and onto the floor.  We're going shopping again this weekend for another potty for her - here's hoping we can find one that she likes and that doesn't require mopping up after she uses it.",1
"Baby K'tan Breeze Baby Carrier, White, Large",this is nice b/c daddy + baby boy = sweatiness!  allows for a nice breeze and baby is 5mo and loves adventure position.  well worth the price (most other carriers are so expensive) AND EASY TO PUT ON!,4
Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,This product is really wonderful when traveling by airplane.  It just hooks to your carry on luggage on wheels and the child sits right in it as you stroll through the airport.  So many people made comments about it as I walked through airports while traveling.  They thought it was the neatest thing.  I was 6 months pregnant when I first used it and it was great to not have to lug a big stroller around and I had less things to take with me.  I gave it 4 stars only because it does take a short time to hook/unhook it every time you get on or off the plane.  I had to pull to the side and keep my daughter with me while I hooked the seat back on to the luggage.  But other then that it is one piece of nylon and not a huge stroller and I will take that anyday!,4
"Kissaluvs Cotton Fleece Hybrid One Size Contour Diaper, Unbleached",My son is a heavy wetter so we're constantly on the hunt for great affordable bedtime diapers. We are pretty loyal to Thirsties but their fitteds are the only thing that work for nighttime and they're just so darn expensive! I found these here on Amazon and figured why not... it's only $10! Out of the three bedtime diapers we have this is go-to. I will definitely be ordering more so that naptimes are covered as well =),5
"The First Years Spinning Drying Rack, White","I have been using this drying rack for close to 7 months now and I really like it.  Some of the reviews I've seen says it doesn't work well for glass bottles; we use plastic bottles, so I cannot comment on that.  However, it seems plenty sturdy for the bottles I use.  The bottles I use are Dr. Brown's, so there are a lot of parts that go with them, and this drying rack provides good drying space for all of my bottle parts.",5
"Medela Contact Nipple Shield, Small","The name attached is my husbands but anyway.  Our daughter was full-term but under wieght because of scarring on the placenta.  She had a very difficult time latching on and sucking because of her tiny mouth and my not so tiny breast.  We also found that I had and inversion problem as well.  When the nipple shield was introduced, she had no issues attching and getting down to business.  Make sure that you have the right size but seeing a lactation consultant or your doctor.  We started with the 24mm and it was too big for both of us.  The 20mm was a perfect fit for both of us.  Also, a tip to keep them in place without falling off or flipping up use a touch of lanolin on the rim and it will stick without any troubles and no leaking if they fall asleep with milk in thier mouth.",5
Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,This product saved me!  I used to spend all my time trying to entertain my baby even while I was cleaning around the house.  Now that I have the Baby Einstein caterpillar I can get up to 30 minutes to myself to clean around without having to worry if she is being stimulated enough.  I wasn't crazy about the dragon puppet so I took it off but everything else she loves.,5
"Skip Hop 4-Piece bumper-free Crib Bedding Set, Alphabet Zoo",This crib set was perfect for our baby. I especially love the cozy blanket. It was a great value also.,5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",Bought 3 of these. Returning one as it didn't fit. Ordered the extra wide which was a piece of crap. But this one was great for smaller/standard doors.,4
Sassy Spin Shine Rattle Developmental Toy,"my son LOVED this rattle. i loved it too until i started washing this thing (maybe i wasn't supposed to?) and one day i noticed mold on the target sticker. i tossed it that day, but until then it was one of his favorite toys.",4
Summer Infant 10 Piece Keep Me Clean Disposable Potty Protectors,Works Ok. Not a lot of tape to hold it to the seat. Good for when kids/adults need to poop on a public toilet. I keep one in my toddler bag just in case.,4
"Orbit Baby Stroller Travel System G2, Mocha","My daughter was born a preemie so she had to be tested in the car seat for 45 minutes before we could take her home.  My daughter, only 5 lbs at the time, passed with flying colors.  The nurses at the hospital said my orbit was the first they had ever seen, and mentioned that, with the newborn headrest, it worked great with small babies.  My daughter cried for a minute or two then fell asleep for the rest of test with no sign of distress.Now my daughter is 1 and she loves her orbit, it has grown with her perfectly.  We constantly get compliments on our stroller system, it's definitely an eye catcher.  My wife and I got the entire system including the bassinet, and the rocker.  We love the fact that the bassinet and car seat dock into all parts (stroller, car docking, rocking base).  The fact that the seat can rotate in the base is absolutely great!  I've used other car seats in the past, and the orbit system is so convenient because you can rotate the car seat to face you to strap the baby in.  I take my daughter and the family dog for a walk to the park, if the sun is in her eyes and the sun shade won't block the sun, all I need to do is rotate the seat in the base.  You can also pull the stroller right up to a table at a restaurant and rotate the seat to save space or keep the stroller out of the aisles.The car docking base is so easy to install.  I brought my base and car seat to the local police station to have them check out the install and certify correct installation before I brought my daughter home from the hospital.  The officer told me that they had heard of this system but had never seen one before.  He was astonished to see how easy it was to install and how stabile it seemed.  It took him about 5 minutes to read the directions, uninstall the base and then re-install.  I've had my brother and my mother both move the base and system to their cars for a day or a weekend and they were both able to install the complete system in minutes.The customer service is also friendly and very helpful.  When I picked up the stroller the rear tire was flat, I just called up customer service and they over nighted me a new tube and pump so I could start using my stroller immediately.  There are so many other features to talk about, but not enough time to type it all out.  Definitely a great system!",5
Wow Cup for Kids - NEW Innovative 360 Spill Free Drinking Cup - BPA Free - 8 Ounce (Blue),"I have to say, the Wow Cup has to be one of the coolest kid inventions ever made!  My son has oral motor issues and poor fine motor skills.  He can suck, and can drink from an open cup with a lot of assistance, so when he's ready to move away from the dreaded sippy cup, THIS will be perfect!!  He likes to throws things, too, so having less to clean up will be nice, LOL!!Don't think the Wow Cup is only for kids!  I have a sewing business, and I have learned that I cannot have something to drink sitting next to me while I work - I have spilled on my fabrics. When I'm super busy sewing, I don't like having to stop what I'm doing and use both hands to, say, untwist a bottle cap, or something else spill-proof.  The Wow Cup solves that problem for me - if I knock it over, no worries! And I can grab it with one hand, while still working with the other hand, keeping up production.If you visit Wow Cups's online store, you'll see you can get replacement valves - and they even offer Freshness lids!  Also, take the time to read thru the Important Information that comes with the Wow Cup.  While it is dishwasher safe, it is NOT microwave safe, nor it is to be used with carbonated liquids; non-issues for us as we don't have a microwave or drink soda.  It should not be used with hot liquids either.The Wow Cup gets a big thumbs up from me!Reviewed by Anne for New Age Mama",5
"aden + anais Muslin Hooded Towel &amp; Washcloth Set, Water Baby",I got hooked on this brand when my little boy was a newborn. I love all of their swaddler blankets - they were the only brand that would stay wrapped up. This towel set is no different. Love it and so does my boy!,5
Bearington Pink Puppy Blankie Wee Wiggles,My baby girl loves this security blanket. She plays with it and holds it all night long! So soft and safe for infants. I've ordered 3 !,5
"C.R. Gibson Memory Book, Baby Bots","This book is very cute and I like the set up.  It goes through age 5 of the child.  The only thing I wish were different was that there was more space to write about for during pregnancy time.  I also saw this book in store, about the same price.",4
Baby Planet Solo Sport Stroller Cobalt Blue,"I reviewed strollers, like other mothers, for a few weeks before I decided on this one.  I wanted a cheap and well designed stroller for my toddler.  We got to the zoo and in airports and malls a lot!!! I like this stroller for almost every reason.  It has a really cute look and comfy padding for my son.  It folds rather small and quite easily.  It's light.  My only issues were this:  I wish it had a carring srap(it's kinda akward to hold in any such way), the visor could provide better sun coverage(the weather shield would be good to come with it or buy after), and the strap between the legs is just to far back. The part where it meets the fabric to keep it in place is too far back and makes it uncomfordable for an older child.  I just took the strap out from the seat and made it a 4-point harness instead.  Overall my son loves it.  It has bright blue and meets all my needs.  The cross bar in the basket doesn't interfear in any way!",4
"Vital Baby Press 'n' Pop Mini Freezer Pots, Orange, 1 Ounce, 8 Pack","I recently started making homemade baby food and needed more storage containers. I decided to give these a chance and I like them a lot! The lids snap on very nicely and I use Dr. Browns labels to note the type of food. They also have a very convenient little rubbery bottom to help pop out frozen veggies or fruit! They are tiny, however, so I should have bought more. Overall, very nice!",4
Billy Bob Grillz Pacifier,These binky a are cool I like em alot and so does my son but I don't recommend giving these to little babies cuz the thing is long and they will choke,5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,"This monitor works really well- we can hear everything in the baby's room without a problem.  I like that it shows that it is ""linked"" so you don't second guess yourself about whether it is really working or not.Three changes would lower the annoyance factor on this monitor.  First, the power button is hard to press on both units.  You press it and it doesn't turn on, so you hold it a little longer and it turns on then off because you held it too long.  Second, if the parent unit is turned off and you plug it back in to charge, it turns itself back on.  Seems like a helpful feature until you are upstairs in bed saying, what's that weird beeping noise?  Finally, the power button is in a different place on both units.  Totally seems minor until you just get your kid to sleep and try to turn the monitor on in the dark.  I know this seems minor but is very frustrating as an over tired new parent.",3
Maclaren Rain Cover - Volo,"Fits perfect on the stroller.  If you leave it in the bottom when you fold it up as we did, it crumples up into a tiny ball. We were able to use it again after that, it just looked all wrinkled. My daughter didn't mind at all though and it kept her nice and dry. Overall, good product just wish it weren't $30 for a piece of plastic.",4
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"These breashshields were recommended to me by a lactation consultant. The inside diameter does fit better than the medium size the pump came with but I really need it to be smaller as too much tissue is still drawn in.The outer shield part is too small, it doesn't even cover the dark areola. Medela shields get smaller as the inside diameter goes down. If your breasts are large with small nipples none of the shields will be comfortable. The opposite is true as well from what I've read, if your breasts are small with large nipples the larger 'correct' size for you will not be comfortable.If medela would make shields the way bras are made, with two measurements, it would be great.They get three stars because it's good there are size options, some pumps don't have interchangeable shields so it's good medela offers this option to the women the various shield sizes will fit. They also work ok. I ordered the soft shields (in their only size, medium) to see if they will work better than these and be more comfortable.",3
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet, Celery",I purchased other sheets at a high end boutique and like these sheets much better.  They are very soft and strechable.  Easy to get on and off mattress.  Highly recommend.,5

"Kalencom Midi Buckle Bag, Calypso","My favorite of all my baby items, I love this bag! I was worried that the laminate finish would make it look and feel cheap but that is definitely not the case. It looks beautiful and the laminate reduces any signs of wear... it looks brand new every day. Size-wise it is smaller than your average diaper bag... but that's why i bought it! By the time my little girl was two months old I was so sick of lugging around my giant Eddie Bauer bag and I knew I had to downsize. This one is perfect. I am able to take all the necessities without adding any bulk.The side pockets fit her bottle perfectly and the inside houses a change of clothes, formula, diapers, wipes, a book and a toy. It comes with a changing pad and a zipper pouch. Since space is limited and the changing pad is HUGE I leave it out most of the time and just use a blanket I have with me if I need to change her somewhere. There are more compact changing pads out there that would be perfect. If you need even more space you can replace the zipper pouch with a plastic baggy, haven't had to do that yet though.I get a lot of compliments on it every time I go out and if it weren't for the baby and the bottle sticking out of the side pocket, you wouldn't even know it's a diaper bag.",5
"Skip Hop Bento Mealtime Kit, Black","We use this to carry snacks and lunch for our two kids.  The containers are a good size (half of a sandwich cut up fits into one), BPA free, and the shape of the cooler allows it to fit nicely in a diaper bag.  We have the Skip Hop Double Duo and the Duo diaper bags and it fits easily into both. The set comes with 6 containers, so you can have 3 in the cooler and an additional 3 for non-refrigerated snacks. Even with 3 containers, there is room for utensils in the cooler. We have found it to be a very useful and good quality product. The top of the bag also has an elastic strap that you can use to secure a sippy cup or water bottle.I hope they sell the reusable gel freezer pack separately, since it is a unique size (fit specifically for the cooler bag).  We haven't needed a new one, but just in case it gets lost or damaged at some point I would like to be able to replace it without buying a whole new set. This review is by someone who is 100% non-compensated in any way.",5
3D &quot;Choo Choo Train&quot; Sippy Cup Labels &amp; Baby Bottle Labels (2 pack),They barely fit on my dr brown bottles and I used a permanent sharpie marker and it STILL smears. Very disappointed,1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"I purchased my swing prior to the delivery of my third daughter.  She was premature, born at 34 weeks, and she looked pretty small in it at first.  However, she seemed comfortable and content.  She is now a whopping 23 pounds and our swing still works flawlessly. There have been many nights where my daughter slept from dusk till dawn in her swing.  The batteries were pretty well shot by that point, but I never experienced any kind of smell or difficulty with function. When my daughter was 5 pounds, the highest setting was WAY TOO fast.  Now that she is 23 pounds, the highest setting is required to obtain the equivalant movement as the low setting for a 5 pounder.  Even at 23 pounds and 29 1/2 inches long, the support bar on the back of the unit has not proved problematic. Know ahead of time that it is a ""full size"" swing. It is not designed, nor represented, as easily portable or compact.  It should come as no surprise to the consumer that it is as it claims. I did not experience any of the negative issues reported by the minority on this site. I say, buy in confidence and enjoy.",5
"Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 8 Ounce, 3 Count","Each baby has their preference, but I can say that my baby really loves these wide nipples. Don't know what that says about me... hahaBut regardless, they are great bottles. And my baby doesn't get gassy or spit up, but that might just be unique to my baby too.The negative is that it's a major pain to clean all those extra bottle parts. But if it's what my baby wants then it works for us.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"When having our first child I had the impression that this was a MUST have item for the nursery. I would have to say I gave in and bought it and wish I would have spent my money on another item that was needed. I ended up using grocery bags that were in our home already instead of buying expensive refill. Another complaint is that when you start the """"string of sausage"""" it is rather difficult and doesn't always start off well. I would just suggest putting your money on a better item.",2
Zoli Baby Breath Electric Nasal Aspirator,We purchased this because we have a newborn baby and know they have a lot of boogies. So I wanted only the best for him!,5
Medela Valves &amp; Membranes (Set of 2),It is imperative to have extra parts when you're pumping. These fit just as well as the original valves that came with my pump.,5
"Summer Infant Secure Surround Play Safe Play Yard, Tan","I purchased the Summer Infant Secure Play Yard for my 8 month old crawler.I like the fact that it has a door with a handle, so my other children can enter and entertain my little one when I can't get to her.The door can be a bit tricky to line up to close,but all it takes is a little practice. I had other yards where you had to climb over, that wouldn't of worked for our family.",4
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,I'm sure it's perfect. I sent it to my aunt who's having her new grandson for company so I myself have not used it but when I called her she said it was perfect.,5
"Safety 1st Air Protect On Board 35 Infant Car Seat, Rio Grande","The seat I received had a manufacturer date from 2009!!!  Considering that car seats only last 6 years and we'd like to use it for more than one child, this is totally unacceptable.  So, I got in touch with Amazon, and they overnighted us a replacement.  Guess what?  Same manufacturer date!  I'm so frustrated.  LOVE the seat, it looks awesome, it feels super safe, fit great in our Civic, but we're not paying $150 for a seat that's already 2 years old.  They need to take these off the shelf.",2

"Sugar Booger Kiddie Play Back Pack, Prehistoric Pals","I bought this product for my 18 mouth daughter, she already loves it & will not take it off. I don't have a problem with the straps & when tightened they fit her properly. The only thing I noticed is that the background darker in person then it looks in the picture. I thought it would be lighter. But for the most part it's a great little bag & I've already gotten compliments on it! 5 stars!",5
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","this thing rocks... when I was pregnant with my second son the one thing I dreaded was bathing a squirmy, slippery infant, my first had hated being bathed until he was about three months old and I always wound up almost as wet as the baby because of him squirming and how awckward using a tub was.  Well, I found out about this on the BRU website and read all the reviews and decided this was for me.  I don't regret getting it one bit and am looking forward to many years of use.  It was SO easy to bathe my newborn in it, I can't imagine ever wanting to use one of those horrible plastic tubs again.  You get to use both arms to bathe and rinse your baby while the comfy warm pillow holds him in place for you.  It's just great!  And I don't wind up soaking wet after bathing my baby anymore, which is another big plus.  Just make sure you squeeze out all the water every time you're done using it, so you don't have to worry about mildew.  If for some reason you do get some mildew in it, soak it in hot water and one cup white vinegar for an hour, then wash in your washing machine and it should be good as new.Enjoy bath-time with your baby, it's one of the fondest memories you'll have!",5
"Ju-Ju-Be Be Tween Diaper Bag, Black/Silver","I love the way this bag keeps you organized but is nice and compact. I wish it were a little smaller because right now I can fit diaper change items, one set of clothes and 2 bottles. I'd like to fit in a book and a couple of toys but it's not large enough. It's a little overpriced for the size but well made and great for hanging off a stroller. If you need a bag to tote around all day, I wouldn't recommend this one, but for a quick outing for a couple of hours, this bag fits the bill.",4

kateaspen Born to be Wild Animal Place Card/Photo Holders,"I used this as the table decor, I wanted to have few of the couple's photos and holding an ultrasound photo probably would've been nice but just didn't have the chance to do all that. I put up instructions for the game, and guestbook sign in place to ask the guests to write something... and at the end (although one of them broke...we had kids wildly running around and got a hold of the attractive cute animals...) I was able to give to the mom-to-be as a take home gift for decor for the nursery.",5
"Comfort &amp; Harmony Mombo Covered Nursing Pillow Slipcover, Vine and Whimsy","This slip cover is cute with a nice pattern and it washes easily and slips back on the pillow with no issues. As a birth doula I find this product to support both functionality and cleanliness it really makes sense to have a seaperate, extra slip cover for the pillow. Fast, easy to use and the slip cover did not shrink in the dryer. A user friendly product.",4

"Bumbo Floor Seat, Aqua",My granddaughter has a lot of energy. She doesn't like to lie down. She wants to sit up and see the world around her. She loves this bumbo seat!

"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet",We had our 3rd child. And I never spent this much on just a mobile before. BUT I have to say it is AMAZING!! He loves the pictures over his head. And he seems to love the nature setting of the ocean the best. There are so many sounds and songs to choose from. He just seems to prefer the sounds of the ocean. He unlike my other two is a bit fussier with his teething. And sometimes when he is fighting sleep or really fussy I lay him under this and it just calms him so quickly when nothing else works. I actually just told friends about it and they are buying it as well! LOVE THIS PRODUCT can NOT say enough about it. It is worth every penny spent! And it works great with his night sky themed crib. I think it would go well with any theme. And once he is too old for the mobile I can take it off yet still show the pictures on the ceiling with the sounds!!,5
900 MHz Home Connection Monitor,"I got this for the same reason everyone else did 2 kids in different roomS and I want to be able to hear them both. I love this Monitor its a great idea if you are lucky to not have static while you are using it. Also most of the time one of my recevers wouldent let me hear noise coming from  the ""A"" monitor the only way I knew my son was making noise was the light being lit up. I have since swiched the monitor recevers cords that had helped now no problems but, still static. Whats a mom to do!!!",4
"Graco Highback TurboBooster Car Seat, Spitfire","I just assembled 2 of these for my 4 year old twins and installed them in the car.

"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","I was previously buying cheaper brushes and going through them every 6-8 weeks until this one. I picked it up at my grocery store and was nervous at the price for a brush, but as soon as I used it, realized not all brushes are the same. This brush works great and the detachable piece at the bottom is great for cleaning sippy cup valves and hard to reach places, as well as cleaning the brush itself! Highly recommend if you buy the OXO sippy cups as well.",5

I tried getting a slipcover from Bellini but was told it would not fit because the glider was too old. I decided to take my chances when i ordered this slipcover.

I tried it and it did well with my weight, so I do feel that my son would be safe using it. Definitely recommend it!

"Fantasy Furniture Roundy Chair with Microsuede Ottoman, Hot Pink","You definitely can't go wrong for the price of this chair and ottoman. Like other reviewers say it is certainly small but my 16 month old loves it. She even tried to fall asleep in it.

"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","We bought this gate to keep the pet in our mud room when needed. This gate works great and we love that it can be kept in place when not being used to close off the area. The opening is big enough and only seems a little tight when carrying in heavy bags of groceries. It has never been a big problem. The lock can be a little tricky for one handed operation but we just close the lock without clicking it under the locking part. This may not be a good idea if buying this gate for kids but our dog hasn't figured out how to open the gate with the clasp closed but not locked. Great gate for the money. The only reason that I didn't give it 5 stars is I would like the extra width. However, this should not keep you from choosing this great gate, especially if you don't plan to use it in an entry way.",4
Safety 1st 30 Pack Secure Press Plug Protectors,"While these are very secure in the outlet, I don't see how the Secure Press feature helps get this out!  I've ruined almost every finger nail trying to remove them.  The package brags ""Push to pop out - save your nails.""  I'm trying to find a video online showing someone do this successfully - no luck.So I guess my baby is safe from outlet shocks, but unfortunately, I can't use them either!",1
"Ecosusi Diaper Backpack, (pink)","I was searching for so long for something this functional! And just when I was about to spend triple on another back pack style diaper bag I happened to come across this one on amazon, and boy am I glad I did!! I am a mom of two, my son who is 2 and my daughter is six weeks, so between the two of them plus my own stuff I have a lot to carry. Before purchasing this back pack I was using a large tote style purse which just left everything in a jumbled mess! And it was so hard to keep on my shoulder while trying to deal with the kiddos. This bag is so light whieght and with the many pockets everything stays right where I put it and my bag stays nice and organized! And it is so comfortable on my back! I don't even notice it when I have it on, even for long periods. The built in stroller straps are great as well. My only small complaint is that I wish the front little pocket had either a magnetic or zip closure instead of the velcro. That pocket is perfect for my phone and keys but I am nervous to put them in there because it would be very easy for someone to take it right out of there with out me realizing it, but that's very minor to me. And you absolutely can not beat the price of this bag! The shipping was also very fast. I highly recommend this bag to any mom looking for a backpack style diaper bag! You won't be disappointed, this bag has made my life so much easier! And you moms know how important that is :)",5
Ikea Duktig 8-piece Fish/Salmon Set,This is a great toy. Love that ikea &#34;food&#34; has lots of healthy options. My little guy loves this. Great,5
Fisher-Price Deluxe Sit-Me-Up Floor Seat,"My son can sit up just fine on his own but now that he's trying to reach and crawl, he often falls over. So when I have him in a room with a hardwood floor, I like to have him in a seat. I tried a Bumbo and he arches his back and cries. I tried this seat and he seems much happier. He loves the toys that were included but I like that I can also switch them out for others. It feels comfortable and less restrictive than a Bumbo seat. With a wider base, I also feel like it's safer and less likely to tip over, which is a concern right now since he is so active. The seat was very easy to assemble. The seat cover is easy to remove for cleaning. The only thing I noticed is that my baby's feet don't touch the squeaky foot pads. He's not particularly tall but the way he sits, the footpads fall behind his heels. It's too bad because when I press on them and they squeak, he's so amused. But that is a minor flaw and it doesn't take away from the fact that both of my kids love it. This seat is so cute, my 2 year old wants it for herself!",5
Full Coverage all-in-one Hands-Free Pumping Bra &amp; Nursing Tank by Rumina Nursingwear - Black Medium,"I could not get this to work for hands free pumping. Also, I would not have been able to wear this as a regular tank top out in public. Returned.",1
"Delta 24 Piece Nursery Closet Organizer, Green","This closet organizer worked perfectly for me. I needed it to take a very small, ineffective closet in the baby's room and make it functional, along with creating useable space. I got the bonus of it looking good in the closet too! I was a little skeptical of the pink color - if it would be too much but it really helps to boost the look of the closet space with some color so I'm glad I didn't choose to get the beige one. The organizer is very sturdy, the drawers are easy to maneuver off the shelves, the pockets on the side are perfect for socks and shoes, the hangers hold little outfits in place very well, and I really like the dividers! The set comes with stickers to put on the dividers so you can quickly and easily divide baby's clothing by months (0-3, 3-6, and so on) with very little effort. I was also concerned with how much the organizer would be able to hold on those soft shelf areas where the drawers wouldn't be...I can say it holds quite a bit! I used that space for onesies and swaddling apparel and it is holding quite a bit of weight and it's easy to see where everything is. I would highly recommend this product for anyone needing to make more use of a nursery closet - it will do the job!",5
"Safety 1st Guide 65 Convertible Car Seat, Victorian Lace","First of all, my 18 lb 4 month old loves this carseat! And I feel like he's very safe and secure. It was a little difficult to install. It required the use of a dense pillow under it to achieve the correct recline. The thing that bothered me the most however, is that the belt strap that you pull to tighten baby into the seat is pretty far down on the front of the carseat, leaving it pinched between the baby carseat and the actual seat it's in (while rear facing). Yes it's a little hard to tighten, but it's something we decided to deal with, and we now have three of this seat, two for us and one for grandma.",4
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I received the bath station as a gift at my baby shower.  I had put it on my registry thinking it was great to have tub since I could use it until my son reached his toddler years.  At first I had to figure out how to assemble the tub which took me a little while to do, because it was so hard to pull together.  After I used the bath station it was fine for a couple of uses (about six times) then all of a sudden water started leaking from the tub from the sides now I have to go and buy a new one.  I recommend you do not buy this product.",1
The World of Eric Carle: The Very Hungry Caterpillar Teether Rattle by Kids Preferred,"My mom actually bought this little guy in Seattle years back for my daughter. She loved it... and unfortunately, along with many others, we lost it somewhere... So, i instantly found it here and bought it again for my now 6 month old son.Both my kids love this toy, it's so durable and bright and the rattle is cuteeee.Please be careful not to lose it because you will miss it.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"I was a little hesitant before purchasing this item as some of the reviews were downright scary. I took the plunge and I am so glad I did! My son LOVES his rainforest Jumperoo! We tried it for the first time at 6 months but he did not want to stay in for too long without mommy or daddy to cheer him on. He is now almost 9 months and literally makes this cute crying noise each time we walk by the jumperoo because he wants to get in, jump around and explore all the various buttons and animals. The cool thing that I absolutely love about this product is that the chair moves around easily and so my son is never bored as he explores each of the exciting little animals,lights and the music is tons of fun. He recently discovered the little bird and frog that hang above his head and it sooo cute to see him trying to swat them. The only thing I would honestly say is that you have to have a bit of patience when putting this product together especially the seat. It's not very easy but once you have everything in, have a video camera ready as you will want to capture the first moment your little one gets in! I highly recommend this product.",5
Sunshine Kids Easy View Back Seat Mirror,I love this mirror.  It is very clear.  It takes some adjusting at first and it will move a little over time.  But I love it!,5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","This is an OK gate if you are watching your budget. However, I do have a few complaints about it. First, the paint on this gate is TERRIBLE. I have had it less than a week and the paint on the gate is chipped in multiple places and there have been NO hard objects near it other than the wall itself. Pretty disappointed in that. Second, this gate says it is supposed to go to 40in and the opening I had placed the gate is only 38 in & it isn't as sturdy as I would like/wanted it to be. I will not be putting this gate on the stairs like I had intended because I don't think it will be sturdy enough withstand my near 9 month old pushing against without it giving in. Other than that this is an OK and cost friendly way to keep my kitchen blocked off from my son. Would only recommend it for sectioning off rooms, not for stairs.",3
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears in Black Chambray,"I own this product and the Baby Bjorn.  My baby does not seem to like the NoJo very much and I prefer the Bjorn in almost all aspects.  This product is more difficult to use and less secure.  The position of the baby can shift with your movement (ie: if you go from sitting to standing or if you need to lean over a little bit ); that disrupts and upsets my baby.  Although you can breastfeed in it, I think it is easier to remove the baby from the sling before nursing (but i have to admit that I feel the same way about the Bjorn and also feel pretty comfortable nursing in public).  The Bjorn holds your baby closer to your body and heartbeat and my baby definatly prefers that.  For an infant, the inward facing position of the Bjorn is also more protective from strangers and germs.  Maybe I'll like this product better when  my baby is a little bigger.  I do use it at times when I don't have to also deal with my toddler, but the physical demands of a three year old require too much movement to safely use the sling.  It does distribute the weight pretty well and is a welcome break to the shoulder fatigue sometimes caused by the Bjorn.  It is also better if you are eating, reading, or writing because the baby rides much lower.",2
Graco Lovin' Hug Open Top Swing in Clara,"There appears to be something defective about the motors of these swings, because ours also stopped working.  Initially it worked intermittently, or would stop after being on only a few minutes, but now it's stopped entirely.  I am really disappointed and do not recommend it.",1

"Jeep Cling Sunshade, 2 Pack","bought for my jeep patriot, since i drive all day. i need something quick to put on and doesn't modify the car (its a company car). blocks the sun pretty well. it does have a lot of bubbles, who cares its only 5 dollars and doesnt block view. also it doesnt come off when window is down, i wouldn't recommend rolling it down all the way, just in case. still a great buy!",4
Fresh N Freeze 2 oz. Reusable Baby Food Containers 12-Pack,These are good if you plan on using the food soon otherwise you will need a ton of them.  We had a problem getting the food out of the containers once frozen.  I love that the lids screw on and that they are easily stackable.,4
Philips AVENT Express Food and Bottle Warmer,"Very simple to operate.  Just turn it on.  Then turn it off when you estimate the milk has reached the desired temperature.But the unit has no timer and you have to track the time on your own.  Also, the unit will not turn off by itself.I would think for something this simple, some company can provide a cheaper lower cost product.",3
"Britax Advocate 70 CS Convertible Car Seat, Zebra","Received my daughter's Britax Advocate 70 car seat in Serene and I am extremely happy with it! First off, we previously had the Britax B-Safe travel system when our daughter was a newborn and she's used it up until now and she is about to be 1yrs old. She can still fit in it, but I wanted to get her a new one as she's a longer and needs a little more room. It'll also be easier for me to put her in it since I'm still going to have her rear-facing in the middle of the backseat as long as possible. We've been so impressed with the quality and safety with all the Britax car seats and so I knew we would stick with Britax for many years and babies to come! The Advocate itself was clearly well made. You can feel the sturdiness in it and the quality. I chose this particular model because of the extra side-impact protection. It is definitely on the wider side, so if you have an SUV or van, this seat is ideal. While this would still fit into a smaller vehicle, other passengers in the back might be a little cramped. Anyway, be sure the read up and refer the Britax's main website for the additional safety features. In person this car seat is everything I had hoped for regarding safety, quality, longevity, and aesthetics. The serene color is perfect for our cream leather interior and for warmer climates (we travel back and forth from CA to FL) versus the darker black/gray versions. I highly recommend!!",5

"Ju-Ju-Be Clear Zipper Plastic Pouch, Mess Shuttle","This little bag does just what it is suppose to do. It keeps messes in the bag instead of all over your diaper bag! My only complaint is that it is somewhat small. It can fit one diapers, or two bibs. This is the only reason for the four stars. Ju Ju Be products rock, and their quality is some of the best I have seen yet! I bought mine from Little Dudes and Divas... their customer service is amazing and the shipping is super fast!",4
2 pack Gerber Fitted 100% Cotton Knit Bassinet Sheets,I use this sheets on my arms reach mini cosleeper. Nice that they don't snag clothes in the wash compared to the Arms Reach brand which has Velcro and more expensive.,5
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","These brushes are good multipurpose brushes and aren't good just for cleaning bottles. We use these to clean the small crevices of breast pump breastshield connector parts, sippy cups, straws for our Camelbak bottles, and more. We have been using these for over 6 months and they are still durable in the sense that they doesn't lose the bristles and clean the hard-to-reach places. They are pliable so if you're looking for something sturdy to make it easier to hold onto then these may not work for you. But for regular handwashing purposes and for folks that do a lot of handwashing bottles/straws and related parts, these do the trick and then some!",4
"Britax B-Safe Infant Car Seat, Black","The carseat and base are fine in and of themselves.  The carseat clicks really easily into the base, BUT the carseat is SO heavy!  This is especially an issue because Britax doesn't sell a small click-n-go stroller type base, so you have to drag the carseat everywhere and it's definitely a 2-handed job.  We have the B-Agile stroller, which is great for outside walking and the mall, but is too large to take into a doctor's office or other tight places.  We got this carseat in black, which was good because it didn't show staining (like when we had diaper blowouts), but I think it did make baby a bit warmer due to it being such a dark color.  Overall, fine, but I wouldn't purchase again due to the weight and no option for a small click-n-go stroller base.",3
The Original Tummy Tub Baby Bath - Clear,"Excellent product... My baby girl LOVES tummytub time, and has been using it since she came home from the hospital 3 days old.",5
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"I have owned this pack 'n play for 1 year and it has held up well, and is something I would purchase again. I used this every day with my son. He slept in it every night, in the bassinet configuration, from 0-5 months. It's light, mobile, and not too big. I kept it by my bed so I didn't have to buy a separate bassinett. I took it over to his baby-sitters every day for his naps, it's very simple to take down/put up. At 1 year he still sleeps just fine in this when we travel, and the material has held up well with frequent use. I never used the little toy bar, that portion of it felt very cheap, and it's cumbersome to when you're frequently moving the pack 'n Play. If you don't want all of the extras, which I never missed or wished that I had, this is a good choice.",5
"Classic Connect Graco SnugRide Classic Connect Infant Car Seat Base, Silver",We actually had to buy a couple extra bases for each of our cars and the sitters too.,5

,"This is the worlds most wonderful gate.  I have 2 kids and am starting a daycare.  I have a very large living room and want to block my 1 yr. old in, but was having a hard time trying to find something that she couldn't climb or push her way through.  I got one and fell in love with it.  It took some time to figure it out, a specially when I bought 2 more and tried to conceit them all together to make more of a wall.  I did get it to work and now I have a temp. wall/ grate.  The thing I didn't realize is that each section locks, so you can make a wall out of it if you like or use it as a large pen.  I just LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this gate.  Worth every penny.UPDATE:  I have had these gates for about 2 years now and still think they are worth 5, plus star's.  I do have a daycare, so these gates are VERY heavily used, a specially by the now 3 yr. old who can climb these things like a tree, (but she is 1/2 monkey...dad's side :)).  If looking for strong and versatile gate; then look no more...best gate on the best sight for the best price.  Thank you Amazon and North States for making a working 'stay at home mom's' life a little easier.",5
"Kissa's Newborn All-In-One Diaper, Green","I was really excited to use these diapers.  I put them on my baby registry and was thrilled to see that someone had bought them for me.  Once we were home from the hospital, I immediately put my little girl into a beautiful blue diaper!  It was adorable.  However, I think we may not have dried them long enough after the first few wash/dry cycles to prep them because out LO broke out in a yeast infection after about 3 days of wearing.  This, of course, caused us to have to strip and ""de-yeast"" our brand new diapers.  (no fault of the diapers themselves, just frustrating!)  Anyway, after that challenge, we were happily using the diapers for about 3 weeks.  Then, we noticed that our LO started to soak through the diapers at night.  She would wake up for middle of the night feedings and have to be completely changed because her clothes were soaked!  I was surprised that a 4 week old could soak through the diaper, but it happened nearly every night until we started using our hemp wipes as ""inserts.""  That solved the problem for a few days, but it wasn't a long-term fix.  Around week 5 we decided to give our pocket diapers (initially too big to fit) a try.  And thankfully they fit.  We've switched to the pocket diapers and are much happier with the result.Bottom line:  The sizing is great for newborns.  The snap down for the cord is a great idea.  We found the absorbency to be an issue for our little one around 4 weeks old.  She could have fit into these diapers for another 4 weeks, but there is no way we could have contained her pee for that much longer without a doubler or some other soaker insert!These diapers are not worth $15/diaper for the length of time that they are usable.  I don't recommend these diapers.  I wish we would have saved our money and just used prefolds and inexpensive newborn covers for this stage. (or even, dare I say, disposables!!)  :)",2
Munchkin 3 Piece Silly Sandwich Cutter Set,"Very nice and fun way to prepare sandwich. Though I donot have any kids, but i still liked the idea and I am not at all disappointed with my decision to buy these.",5
Fisher-Price Beary Snug Bouncer,"Bought this for my grandson, I like the removable bear pad so it can be washed and the removable toy bar if you want to feed him it won't be in the way. Would have been nice if had some music but I would definitely recommend it.",5
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue),"Just say it out loud &#34;let Mommy suck your boogies out&#34; ... ok, that sounds disgusting!  But the reality is that nothing gets past the tissue placed in the bottom of the Aspirator.  This thing is absolutely effective and easy to use (as long as your kiddo somewhat cooperates)  I love the fact that the filter (tissue) is easy to replace and disposable.  I also adore the fact that it is dishwasher safe (nice to disinfect the booger-sucker)  So much better than the thing they send home with you from the hospital.  This is a must-have item for anyone with small children.",5
Winnie the Pooh (Classic Pooh) Together Time Crib Sheet,I bought this crib sheet to go with the Pooh Bear Crib set we bought. It's super cute and just what I wanted!,5
"Zo&euml; b Organic Fantastic Anti-Plastic Dishes Set, Turquoise/Lime",Absolutely the safest eating product on the market. I replaced all of my daughters plastic cups plates and bowls.

Jolly Jumper Bath Tub Toy Bag,"Holds a lot of toys, had no problem with the suction cups (despite what some others had reviewed), works perfectly",5
Today's Mom Cozy Cuddler Pregnancy Pillow - White,"Cannot figure out why this is labeled as a toy, but here goes... I have owned this pillow for two weeks now and it has been a great help to me. At first, the head cushion was a bit large for me and sort of hurt my neck, but it is calming down with use. The material is comfortable and even though I have not washed it yet because I covered the head portion of it with an extra pillowcase it seems painless to wash and put back together due to it having a zipper unlike many pregnancy pillows I researched. I would not know for sure though at this point however. There are so many pillows out there at ridiculous prices so I was happy to find one for $50 and I must say it is actually worth the money. However, I would not recommend this to taller women. I am not even a full 5ft. 2in. and this pillow hugs my body wonderfully. I cannot imagine it would be very comfortable for people much larger in height especially the portion that goes between your legs. I do not think it would be in the correct position for taller women. The biggest complaint I have about this product is that they need to put a little less cushion in the area for your head and more in the area for your legs. Other than that, I am very happy with this purchase and it has helped me to sleep better and avoid sleeping on my back so often. I hope it continues to serve me well as I enter my sixth month of pregnancy soon.",4

"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange",I had the regular cm and wanted the GT for the adjustable handlebar and the rubber tires. This did not disappoint! I'm 5'8&#34; and the regular CM is ok but the GT is SO much more comfortable! Love it!,5

"ReSnackIt Reusable Sandwich Size Bag, Khaki","I love the concept of reusable bags. Overall their use is limited. Since they fold and close with Velcro, you need to consider what you put in the bag because it is not sealed. For example, chips will be stale by lunchtime if packed in the morning. Also, food must be dry - no fruit that is juicy or pickles or foods of that nature.  Hard to clean and need plenty of time to dry after cleaning.",3

CTA Digital 2-in-1 iPotty with Activity Seat for iPad,"This is such a great idea!!!! I wish this came in adult sizes. We have been all there before, we are working on something and nature calls.

We can go right where we are sitting and once a week or so we take it out side to hose this bad boy down!!!",5

"Philips AVENT Soothie Pacifier, 0-3 Months, 2-Pack, Pink/Purple","I bought these for my 6 month old even though they are labeled for 0-3 months because these are the same size pacifiers that she has on her wubbanub. She loves her wubbanub to cuddle and play with but we wanted to have a couple spare pacifiers on had as well. I use these in place of the wubbanub mostly when I wear her in a wrap or carrier, any other time she wants her wubbanub!",5
"Munchkin Two Snack Catchers, Colors May Vary","These have worked wonderfully for us and have also helped with ensuring our dogs didn't gobble up our son's snacks. Our son is 13 months now and just learned to pull back the flaps, turn it upside down and shake. I guess he liked mommy's reaction so much he now does this all the time, which defeats the purpose. BUT up until then it was great for us!",5

Fresh Baby So Easy First Spoon,I love how soft this spoon is! Super easy to clean! Wish I had these for my other children when they were younger.,5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"Was looking for a lightweight umbrella type stroller but didn't want the cheap versions.  With my older child (8yrs ago) I had a Jeep brand that I loved.  I researched and decided on this Ignite and so glad I did.  It is perfect!!The height of the handles is tall enough for dad and still a good height for shorter ""pushers"" as well.  The handles are a soft rubberized material that will hold up better than the foam covered handles did on my Jeep stroller.  The ease of assembly and opening/closing is nice.  Quick lock/unlock mechanism can be controlled with your foot, has a locking clip to keep folded as well.Wheels maneuver easily on different surfaces and front wheels can be locked into a non-rotating mode to prevent wheel wobble when needed as well.  Kick locks on rear wheels hold firmly.Holds up to 50 lbs which is a decent weight and should hold older/larger child nicely, although mine is only a yr old and 20lbs right now.  The 5pt harness is easily adjustable and had no problem getting the right fit.  The canopy is big enough to provide good coverage and can be adjusted in different positions.  It can also be removed completely if desired.A lot of umbrella strollers don't have cargo areas under them either, this one has a descent amount of space, and while it is kind of a tight squeeze, it is usable and definitely a plus.  Also, the cup holder and zippered pouch on the handles is great!! Holds my large 24 oz cup securely and the zippered pouch is large enough to hold my wallet, keys, phone, and more all at once.The only thing I don't really care for is the way the seat reclines.  It has pull cords on the back that you either tighten up for upright position or loosen to recline.  This does allow for multiple levels of recline, but it doesn't actually lock in position, so when reclined, my daughter was able to sit up and the seat back just moved with her.  There was quite a bit of movement as she continued to sit up and back several times.Overall, very happy with my purchase and would recommend to anyone!!",5
"Luvable Friends Fitted Knit Crib Sheet, White","Extremely soft sheets!  I've bought several different brands of fitted sheets for my two kids' cribs, and love these the most.

Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter has owned Sophie for a year now, receiving it when she was 3 months old. Sophie quickly became her favorite thing, and it accompanied us everywhere for about 6 months. She loved to chew on it, the squeaky sound delighted her, and she even slept with it. At 15 months old, she is no longer as attached to Sophie as she once was, but she still smiles whenever she sees her and plays with her a bit.",5
Skip Hop Soapster Foaming Soap Dispenser,"This is the cutest thing and I was so glad to find it on Amazon. I originally saw it at one of the baby stores and they wanted twice as much money.  This was easy to put up and fill with soap & water.  The only thing that I don't like is how careful you have to be when pumping.  It could be that I'm too rough but I feel that if I were to pump too fast or too hard the entire thing would fall off the wall.  Just be gentle when pumping other than that, i love it.  I actually just ordered the same thing for my nieces for Christmas.",4
Graco Mobile Entertainer Jungle Crew,This is exactly what we were looking for.  We had an older model and wanted another for our twins.  It disassembles easily for packing into a car.  It is very durable and cleans easily.  We use it indoors and outdoors.  The entertainment table has nice animals but they did not easily interface with the child.  You have to pull hard on the animals to make them do anything and it is so low and inconsistent that the child becomes bored with it.  We usually remove it and use the table for Cheerios or other toys anyway.,4
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I purchased this pump as a travel pump for occasional use while away from my baby. I have the Medela single electric also but it is too loud to use discreetly in public. This pump is easy to put together and super compact. I carry it in my purse without a problem, snap it together within a few seconds, and can pump 3 or 4 ounces in less than 15 minutes! I have trouble with letdown when pumping and the 2-phase expression really helps me to get more milk. I've actually had more success with this than the Medela Lactina I rented. Also, the shield on this pump is a bit softer which makes it super comfortable! Definitely worth the money for an occassional pumper like me!!",5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","I have to say, this seat is one of the best things we purchased for our second baby.  He was instantly comfortable in it - just the right angle, rocks just enough, just supportive enough.  And I loved that it has no bells or whistles, no batteries or cords.  And being much higher off the groudn than a bouncy seat, it is much much easier on my back and easier to put a sleeping baby into.  I was so sad when he grew out of this chair!",5

"Dream On Me Bassinet, Blue","I was thrilled to find a pink bassinet! It was easy to put together but I still have to say I'm disappointed overall. First of all, the pink color of the stand does not match the bassinet itself. And second the bassinet is very shallow. My baby is only 6 weeks old and I don't think I'll be able to use it very much longer. I personally think it's poor quality and definately not worth the money.",3

My one huge complaint is that my 13 month old daughter can pop out the clear tray part very easily, sending her snack everywhere. Snapping it back in allows for pinched fingers very easily as well. It got so bad today, I just took it off and threw it in the stroller basket. For the price of this tray, I hoped it would be a lot more functional.",3
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","We purchased these in the slow nipple variety because our son chokes easily on most other brands. He choked less with these nipples, so I give 5 stars for those. The bottles are made of durable plastic. However, the bottles have some drawbacks. First, the measurement markings wear off the bottles quickly. We don't scrub the outside of the bottles but within 3 days of purchasing these the markings began wearing off and by 1 week were almost completely gone, making it difficult to see how much of the bottle our son had taken. The ink began wearing off when our hands were holding the bottle while we fed our son. One of the many disadvantages of having so many of our products made in China, as most baby bottles are now. The quality standards could be a bit higher. Next, the vent on the bottom of the bottles leaks sometimes. Also, the bottle collar can sometimes come easily loosened while the child is eating and begin to leak. The nipples and decreased colic are the best thing about these bottles. The rest needs a bit of work.",3
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","I was a little unsure when I bought this, but it has worked great.My toddler (2.5) was able to take off the door cover.  He hasn't figured this one out.  (yet)",5
The First Years Sweet Sleep Cocoon,"For our first baby, we used (and loved) theFisher-Price Deluxe Bouncer, which costs nearly 2/3 less than this cocoon.  That bouncer could vibrate and play music, and most importantly could operate like a foot-powered rocking chair that magically soothed a cranky baby long enough to let us eat a hot meal.This cocoon can also rock, either front to back or, by turning the orientation of the seat, from side to side.  The rocking is not as easy to do with one foot as the Fisher-Price model, though, since that one relied on the spring tension of the legs (you could push down, and it would bounce back, and it was easy to get a good rhythm going).This has a few advantages over the Fisher-Price bouncer, that may or may not justify the dramatic increase in cost.  Its material is easy to wipe clean with a cloth (the Fisher-Price was absorbent and needed dis-assembly and machine-washing), it can recline farther back for sleep and farther upright for playtime, and includes a canopy for shading a sleeping child (although this isn't likely to be as necessary for an essentially indoor product).As others have noted, this is a challenge to put together, but since you should only have to do that once, it isn't too big of a deal.  The price is a bit high, however, for what it is, and I would still prefer the Fisher-Price even if they cost the same.",3
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue",Perfect. I'm gonna order more so that my daughter will have a few choices for her baby. I ordered this as a Christmas gift and I have plenty of time to get more since she's not due until August but it came and I just love it already.,5
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,"The Alpha Omega is quite possibly the worst product my wife and I have purchased for our baby, now 10 months old.  The only thing worst than an overly complex (horribly complex) and crappy product is two of them...and we made exactly that mistake.  My wife purchased one for her car and one for my car.The two primary reasons that product absolutely is the worst product we have purchased for our daughter are as follows:1) It is EXTREMELY to set up...this is a huge failing in the engineering and design.  It is easy to make a difficult and cumbersome product; it is challenging to create a well designed and easy / intuitive product.  It is VERY clear to me that the engineers that designed this monstrosity have never actually had to use it for their own families.2) You simply cannot remove the cover---in less than 1 hour.",1
"Mountain Buggy Duo Stroller, Chili Dot","I have owned a 2010 Mountain Buggy Duo for a year, and I wanted to inform potential buyers of a defect after some use (not a ton, but a decent amount). The Duo has been squeaking for about the last two weeks and I can't seem to fix the problem. A $700 stroller should not squeak! I also own a 2006 Mountain Buggy Urban Single, and have used the stroller for 4.5 years and have never had a problem. The quality of Mountain Buggy strollers has deteriorated.",3
"Safety 1st Nod-a-Way Bassinet, White","I have been using this bassinet for a little over a month now, and it is working out great. I bought it because I wanted to be able to have my son close to the bed at night but also be able to move him easily into other parts of the house. We were going to use our pack n' play for this but soon found out that it is too wide to fit through our door frames. This bassinet is easy to assemble. We like the fact that it plays music and has vibration which sometimes soothes our son. It is nice that it has the little place for storage on the bottom. Our son is on an apnea monitor, and having that shelf gives us a place to put it. The only negative thing that I can say about this bassinet is that the wheels don't work all that well. They squeak a lot when rolling, and they don't roll well on carpet. This is a little frustrating but is not a big deal. Overall, this is a good bassinet.",4
"BabyKicks 3 Pack Doubler Liner, Natural",Very good quality! A very thick fleece material that is super absorbent. The only negative is they are very thick and caused me to go up an overnight diaper size bc it didn't fit in his normal diaper size.,5
Koala Baby Rolled Marshmallow Blanket (Blue),"This blanket is great its soft, and makes the baby feel snuggly; Malachai's mom love the textureand how it agree's with his skin.",5
KidCo Center Gateway - White,"I purchased this gate after buying a different walk through gate.Regalo Easy Open Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - WhiteI had to sell that one because the only way to have it be secure is to screw cups into the doorway. Otherwise it's loose enough for my 24 lb dog to push over.I wish I'd just bought this one in the first place! Sometimes you really do get what you pay for and this is one of those times. Yes, the Regalo gate is 1/2 the price, but totally unsafe.The KidCo gate is amazing. Super easy to install. VERY sturdy. This one isn't moving! Plus it has the bonus of the opening that you walk through being a lot wider than the Regalo one. Plus there is nothing poking out of the opening to catch on your clothes as with the Regalo. It is easy to open and swings either way, which is handy. It's nice and heavy and looks very nice. The dogs are confined, but I can get through with a load of laundry without pulling down a gate or risking life and limb by climbing over one.All in all I highly recommend this gate. It's a great height, easy for the cats to jump over, but high enough to keep the dogs in. Great gate and worth the extra money.",5
"Maclaren Quest Stroller, Beatles Yellow Submarine","I purchased this stroller for my son's daughter in November 2011.  They absolutely love the stroller as he and my daughter-in-law are big Beatles fans!  Not only is the stoller terrific looking, it is also wonderfully light-weight and easy to collapse and set-up.  I don't agree with one of the other reviews in which the reviewer states that they purchased the stroller in December of 2009.  This particular stroller was not available for purchase until January 2011. The Maclaren brand is an excellent stroller and one that will last years if properly cared for.",5

Purple and Brown Bed Skirt for Mod Dots Toddler Set by Sweet Jojo Designs,"I bought this because I wanted to buy separate bedding for our nursery, rather than the super-expensive ""sets"" that have 9 items (only 4 of which you either will or can safely use...seriously, WHY are bumpers still included in sets?). Our crib, like many cribs, converts to a toddler day bed, which is what I thought this was for. If it works for a toddler day bed, it would work for a crib. However, it only works for a REGULAR toddler bed. The ""blank"" side is on one of the short sides, rather than the long side. I ended up fixing it (you can't buy the one for a crib separate) by removing one of the long sides and sewing it to the short side and now it works fine...just with a little extra work on my part. I still saved myself a couple of hundred dollars by doing it this way.The ruffle itself is cute- seems to be average quality and the colors are really nice. It washed well and I looks exactly like pictured.",3

"JJ Cole Urban Bundleme, Ice, Infant","I really love all products from JJ Cole and this particular one is just as great as all of their other products.  The only thing to note is that the color was not pure white as it looks in the photo.  It was a slight grayish/purplish hue, which in my case was actually perfect since I was a little hesitant on having a bright white blanket in the stroller.",5

"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","The arch that you see on the product description page is different from what you get (see customer pictures to spot details). First - green propeller is plastic, and not made of fabric like pictured. When it spins, it can hit your/baby's hand, and yes - it is not strong, but it definitely hurts. Other differences are smaller, but noticeable: lack of red strings around the sun, less colorful butterfly...And the propeller is quite difficult to activate - even by an adult - you have to pull the ball at the right angle, otherwise it will not work. My twin boys quickly gave up trying to figure it out... and I really was hoping that they would like this toy.",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I did not read the spec when I bought this toy, I thought it would be a regular size toy. To my surprise this and other toys I bought was a nice size and nicely made.",5
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","I was an avid runner before, and during pregnancy. After polling many friends, reading reviews, we decided to invest in the BOB. And wait. For my son to be ready to be old enough, and strong enough to support his own head and neck safely while using this to run.*buying the car seat adapter does not make it safe to run with your baby before your doctor says baby is strong enough!!!*Your baby could still get jostled too much, and the stroller was not designed for running with a car seat attached. Seriously.Now that we are road worthy, we have logged quite a few miles!!! I was surprised at how quickly the battle scars appeared; paint scraped rather easily on the frame, reflective trim scraping off when a weather shield is attached with clips.Looking forward to running this into the ground :-)",4
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",Overall this is a great product.  Very sturdy.  It is a little difficult to manuever the panels where you want them to go.  I also had a little trouble connecting the panels to complete the circle.  I use it for my rabbits and it works great.,4
Levana Keera 32012 Remote Controlled Pan/Tilt/Zoom Camera with 3.5-Inch Screen (White/Black),"Things have certainly changed since I last had a little baby, 6+ years ago.  The two monitors we used back then were audio only, and were somewhat adequate when it came to determining whether the baby needed checking on.This Levana Keera camera/remote is an amazing improvement, albeit an expensive one!On the camera side:  finding an adequate place to either mount it or position it on a table, within reach of an a/c outlet, keeping the power cord out of baby's reach, is the initial challenge.  Note, though, that this isn't JUST a camera.  It's capable of playing lullabies, and of transmitting your voice from the remote.  The lens also rotates side-to-side, and up-and-down, and does so very quietly.  There is also a fair-to-middling zoom feature.On the remote side: the hand-held remote has the look of one of today's smartphones or videogames.  It's deceptive in that way, because it has screen icons like you'd see on your ipad, but they are not touch-sensitive. They're controlled by the little directional dial down on the lower right hand corner of the device.  I don't know how many times I've poked at, or tried to drag the icons, only to remember to go back to the thing in the corner.  After downloading the manual and quickly reviewing it, I was able to navigate around the features very easily.  Once the remote was fully charged, I disconnected it from the power cord and carried it around, and discovered the limits of the signal range fairly quickly: so, I can't take the remote out on the front porch on a nice day!This Keera unit has a lot of features that are really nice, but certainly not essential to ""baby monitoring"". You can tell the camera to snap still photos, or take video, you can talk to your baby through the camera, you can have it play lullabies.... there are elements of this contraption that make me think of security/surveillance, which I'm not too comfortable with.  Although more and more our world is filling up with surveillance cameras, I'm not sure I want one of the first things the baby gets familiar with is a wall-mounted surveillance camera!  The lullabies/voice feature just call attention to something I'd rather the baby not be aware of.  But that's just me.I'm impressed with the quality of the camera image, even in low light, and its ability to pick up sound.  Although where I've mounted the camera I can see the entire crib, it's nice to be able to point the camera elsewhere if needed.Also of note: the manual wasn't available online when I first went to the website, and I emailed customer service about it.  They responded with an email, w/ the pdf manual attached, within 12 hours.  Solid.I will probably update this review again in a couple of months after further use.  For now, though, if you are comfortable with the price, and the product specs (especially the signal range) look good to you, this is a great buy.2/2014 update: the biggest drag about this turns out to be the signal range.  It periodically flashes the ""no signal"" icon at distances where it shouldn't be an issue.  Moving the unit around a foot or two usually fixes this, but this inconsistency is a little annoying, making me want to adjust my rating to, say, 4.5 stars.  Other than that... so far, so good!",5
ULTRASCALE MBSC-55 Digital Baby Pet Scale,"We had weight gain concerns with our baby, so we wanted to get a good scale to allow us to track progress but we also wanted one that had the potential for use as a mail scale and kitchen scale (instead of eyeballing a pound and a half of potatoes....).  We like it so far, only I could not quite figure out the complete assembly nor could I figure out how to use the other attachments.  I looked at the instructions but still somehow it eluded me....go figure...at any rate, it works as we have it set up (with the baby basket).  I recommend it for anyone who would like to celebrate those weight gain victories without having to wait for doctors' visits!",5
"Delta City Street Side by Side Stroller, Black","As the parent of two toddlers, I have to say this stroller has pretty much saved me. I live in NYC so I walk everywhere. This is light enough for me to carry down two flights of stairs while monitoring and assisting two young kids. And it's small enough to fit in freakishly narrow store aisles (the norm in New York) while still big enough that my kids are comfy and safe. It rides easy, the handles are high enough that it doesn't kill my back pushing it around, and plenty of room in the storage bags for a snack, some water, and a small toy.",5
"Itzy Ritzy Travel Happens Sealed Wet Bag, Avocado Damask","These products are great. Glad not to buy plastic  sandwich bags anymore. Has a million uses, especially in a baby bag. I would definitely buy more.",5
Boppy Prenatal Sleep Wedge,Life saver for the later months. If you have a nice mattress though you may not need it. I also used it for lying on the couch. Since you can't lie on your back or stomach and are always on your side this helps balance the weight from your belly.,5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink",You buy a product that clearly states its capacity in the description but then you complain it is not big enough for your needs. But you went ahead and bought it anyway because it looks bigger in the picture. Do you base all of your life decisions on how big or small you think an object appears to you in a picture. I'm not trying to be mean here but your review clearly gives this product a real disservice.I am giving this product a five star rating to counteract your rating.Just my opinion.,5

"Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman, White/Beige","This is a great glider that can fit into most spaces. My son and I spend lots of time reading on it and cuddling. Its comfortable and easy to clean. I would not recommend it, though, for nursing as it is too small. By the time my son reached 12 mos it was slightly uncomfortable and the 2 of us plus the Boppy were cramped. If you are not going to frequently nurse, its a great glider.",4
"Fantasy Furniture Pure Organic Slipcover Chair, Natural, Small","I bought this chair for my daughter's first birthday.  I bought a felt sticker with her name on it to personalize the chair.  The color of the chair goes perfectly if an ivory color matches your decor.  We have it in the living room.  I wanted her chair to match with our furniture, instead of being cartoony, hot pink, etc.  Under the slip cover, the chair is back and white plaid.  The slip cover sometimes rides up on the bottom, exposing the plaid pattern underneath.  It is nice that you can take the slipcover off and wash it.  My friend has a chair for her toddler and the arms are a little more traditional that this chair.  Her daughter has fallen off of it many times.  I was afraid that my daughter would fall from this chair but, 3 months has passed and she never has.  I think it has something to do with the design.  When we have more kids, I plan on taking the felt name sticker off and replacing it with something for the next child.  Because it is ivory, it would work for a girl or boy!",5

Microwave Steam Sterilizer,"I needed a steam sterilizer for my baby bottles and I thought that this being big could fit my wide neck Dr. Brown's bottles!I was wrong!It's so hard and tedious to get only five bottles in, and use the lid, without putting in the rest of the items!I am so disappointed!It was cheaper than others, so it is true, you get what you pay for!I am still using it, but this is only because I don't have anything else to use!!!Amy Leea",1
"Delta Canton 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Dark Cherry","This crib is gorgeous! While we have not assembled it just yet, I have inspected all the pieces and the wood, and it look wonderful. I have a friend who bought this same exact crib and hers is set up -- we're both due the same time -- and hers is fantastic. High quality, sturdy and just a beautiful piece of furniture. The color is great too. I've seen it advertised as a ""Cherry Espresso"" other places. Its more espresso with a hint of cherry.I saw this crib at Target, and wanted to buy it on the spot. But, being 6 months pregnant, and shopping alone, it makes it difficult to get it in the cart and home. I decided to have it shipped, but Target wanted $30 to ship it! I found it on Amazon for the same price and free shipping. Shipping was quick and the package was well handled. No tears or visible damage to the box itself.Our son is due in November, so I have some time before I know how it handles under daily use. If its anything less than satisfactory, I'll add an update!",5
"Munchkin Soap Dispensing Bottle Brush,Colors Vary","When you put the brush into the bottle you have to really push it in unless you heat the brush up with hot water first. Then when you try to pull it out, it sprays you into your eyes and the windows and the mirror. The soap leaked out of the base once too and got everywhere. I bought a different brand.",2
"Edushape Educolor Building Blocks, Set of 30","These blocks are great and are a nice addition to my son's existing wooden blocks.  And because they are soft, he can also play with them in the tub.  My son (almost 6) still loves building with blocks so as I said this set was a neat addition.",5
Summer Infant Three-In-One Family Thermometer,"I would encourage every new Mom and Dad to register for one of these or pick one up. I wasn't sure because of mixed reviews, but I am so happy with how well it has held up. When it arrived, the color was a little different than we saw online, but as far as use has gone, we have used, abused and it is still performing well. It stores so well, the attachments pop on and off so well and are easily stored when you are done. Our brute of a son really likes having his temp taken under his arm, so when he is sick and crabby we've even let him 'play' with this for hours (hey, anything to keep a crabby guy happy...) and it even took his use. I really am pleased with it, especially considering how well priced it is compaired to others.I should mention that we got a couple of other thermometers as gifts that simply read the wrong temps, just never worked, or didn't last even through the first half-year.",5
"Summer Infant Character Change Pad Cover, Butterfly Ladybug",These are really nice . i have two of them and keep on alternating them. Serve the purpose well. Are really soft and have adjustments for the belt. Look pretty too which is added bonus.,5
Fisher-Price Royal Potty,"My daughter likes this potty, but I definitely do not. Almost every time she uses it, it leaks. I too thought it was b/c my daughter did not get to the potty in time, but one day I happened to be nearby and saw it spilling over onto the floor. Definitely a defect in design. As for the music as positive reinforcements -- the batteries didn't last long b/c every little movement causes it to go off. I highly recommend people to look into alternative potty chairs.",1
"joovy Foocot Portable Child Cot, Orangie","I bought this Joovy Foocot for my 2-and-a-half year-old daughter to use for daytime naps on the weekends. (During the week she's at daycare, and she still sleeps in her crib at night but refuses to do so for daytime naps).  At first, I tried the much cheaperRegalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue, but that turned out to be a real case of ""you get what you pay for.""  The Regalo My Cot had a nauseatingly strong chemical smell, and it didn't seem like it would be sturdy enough even just for weekend naps.  So I promptly returned it and decided to pony-up the extra money for the Joovy Foocot.And I'm really glad I did!  Right out of the box, the Foocot had no chemical smell whatsoever.  The high-quality 600D nylon fabric (with reinforced seams) that the Foocot is made of looks and feels much stronger than the cheap polypropylene material of the Regalo My Cot.  The Foocot folds and unfolds very easily and comes with a handy, stylish carrying case so it can easily be taken on vacation, to grandparents' house, or even on a camping trip as an alternative to a sleeping bag.  Unlike the Regalo My Cot, the Joovy Foocot has a safety latch to prevent the cot from accidentally collapsing or closing when your child is lying on it.  The Foocot also comes with a very soft fitted sheet, and I purchased thejoovy Foocot Quilted Mattress Pad, White, for some extra cushioning.  (My daughter sleeps on a pretty cushy nap mat at daycare, so I wanted her at-home nap cot to have a similar feel).My 37-inch, 32-pound daughter seems very comfortable napping on the Foocot, and not once has she complained about, or appeared bothered by, the reinforced fabric band in the middle of the cot.  We use the Foocot with the mattress pad, but my daughter would probably be just fine without it.  (However, if you're concerned about the reinforced fabric strip, I'd recommend getting the mattress pad, since the extra padding makes the center strip much less noticeable.)Granted, the Joovy Footcot is one of the most expensive portable child cots available at retail, but it's money well spent, in my opinion.  Spare yourself the disappointment and inevitable returns/replacements of the cheaper cots, and get this one.  I highly recommend it.Grade: A",5

She gets so excited when we float these blankets down on her before nap time. She just loves snuggling up with them. We use them for carseat, swing, bassinet, crib...everywhere. Love them.",5
"Baby Trend Expedition Lx Jogger Stroller, Riviera","I loved this stroller... that is, until I tried to use it for its intended purpose- jogging. It seems that in the stroller that I received, the spokes in the tires were slightly bent, which caused the tires to move in a tiny unnoticeable figure-8 motion and the stroller to oscillate from side to side- this being exaggerated when you are jogging. You can imagine my shock when I began to jog and suddenly saw my 3 week old infant being violently, yes, literally violently, shaken from side-to-side in her properly-installed Baby Trend Infant Car seat, causing crying as if she was in pain. I am positive that if someone else had had this problem, they would have written about it here, so this seems to be an individual product defect (?). I do love this stroller for walking, but I will not be jogging with it until I get it fixed, or potentially, ever. I know I could have returned it (and probably should have) but my daughter really does love it when we are walking and I do like the all-terrain tires.",3

"MamaDoo Kids Foldable Play Yard Mattress Topper, Blue","I thought this item would be included in my free amazon super saver shipping but it was not so I paid an extra 12.99 for shipping. Considering the cost of the item itself, I think this is a little much. I read some reviews about the smell but there weren't THAT many that noticed it, so I purchased the product - but there is a distinct plasticky/chemically smell.The cover is 97% cotton and 3% spandex, the body filling is 100% polyurethane foam.After contacting customer service, I am going to attempt to wash the foam in the bathtub and air it out as they suggested. I really do like the way it fits and the portability of this. I just need ot get rid of this smell. Luckily, I have 7 weeks until the baby is born!Here is my response from customer service:Dear April,Thank you for purchasing our MamaDoo Kids Mattress Topper!We are so sorry to hear about the smell, and for any inconvenience.We carry very little inventory and keep up with demand in real time which means your Mattress Topper was actually manufactured less than 1 week before you received it.  Our foam is made in the US, and freshly cut foam will always smell because of its components, especially high quality dense foam like ours.  This odor is common in many mattress products, as you can read here:Sleep Products Safety Council at: [...]eHow Home:  [...]After much research, and speaking directly with the chemists at our foam manufacturer Future Foam, as well as the Executive Director of the Polyurethane Foam Association we are pleased to share that our foam is non-toxic and does NOT contain any cancer causing chemicals mentioned in many recent articles, including the New York Times:[...]Our MamaDoo Mattress Topper does NOT contain:Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE's)PenteBDEOctaBDEDeca BDEChlorinated Tris (TCEP)Brominated Trisor over 50 other restricted and banned substances in both the European Union and the United States.Our foam follows the regulations and programs of 'restricted or banned substances' which include EU REACH, SVHC, RoHS, TIP, cRoHS, CPSIA, and is certified by CertiPUR-US for durability, content, indoor emissions, and environmental stewardship.[...]We recommend that you give it a bit more time to air out.  For best results remove the foam pieces from the cover and lean them against the wall in a well ventilated area, so that all sides receive equal ventilation. If you chose to wash the foam pieces you could try washing them in the bathtub. We have never washed them in a washer but maybe with cold water it is not a problem... The foam dries very fast if it is in a dry and well ventilated area.We admire your safety concerns for your baby, no doubt you are a great mom.  Sorry again for any inconvenience.  Please, contact us again should you have any other questions or concerns, we want to make sure you are happy with your purchase :)p.s.Most products are manufactured overseas these days and much of the foam found in those products have months to air-out when they sit in containers on ships, trains and trucks.  We made the proud choice to manufacture in California USA... so your product is truly fresh and new, made with high quality non-toxic components.",4

Econobum One Size Cloth Diapers Trial Pack (White),these prefolds are not the best they do not hold allot of fluid and they shrink allot but the cover is a pretty good price and it fits over our other prefolds so all in all i will have to add a insert to the prefolds sold with this but it is still worth the money spent,3
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White",This gate is very high-quality and sturdy--our strong toddlers efforts at pulling at it haven't moved it at all. But it's kind of narrow to get through and would be nicer if it swung open more widely.,4
"Babasling Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Deep Blue",i was really looking forward to this as an alternate option to the wrap but it was difficult to use. I had a hard time adjusting the straps while it was on me and just could not get myself or the baby comfortable. The straps kept twisting so it was very difficult to pull while the sling was on me. I tried to watch the videos on the website but it was not too helpful. I was disappointed.,3
TOYSMITH Ballerina Musical Jewelry Box,"As other reviewers have mentioned, they don't ship the same item that is pictured.  Because the price was low, I figured it was worth the risk to see if I got the correct item.  I did not.",1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free 2 Pack Natural Drinking Cup, 9 Ounces, Green","My son, 1, loves to drink out of regular cups more than most of sippy cups so when I seen these I just had to try. Verdict was..he loved then!",5
"Under The Nile Sleeping Doll Lovie, Blush","I wanted a star-child type doll for my 8 month old daughter, and this works perfectly as a bedtime lovey.  It's the perfect size for her hands and she has loved it from the moment I gave it to her.  The doll itself is very very soft.  I love that it's organic and sustainably made, too.  It's so affordable that I plan on buying several and keeping around as baby-gifts; I know many mamas that will like this for their little ones, too.",5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"These bottles work well with the Medela pump and have nice caps, but the low flow nipple is too much for our little guy when we try to use them for feeding. He's only three weeks old and I'm sure he'll be able to handle them someday, but right now, the ThinkBaby bottles we have seem to work well with him at this stage.",2
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"My daughter slept in this until she was 3 months old. She has reflux real bad so this kept her upright while she slept. It has an adorable mobile that my daughter loves to watch (even now at almost 5 months old), great music (nice variety). The only thing I'm not crazy about is the colors. I wish it was brighter, but that was my choice of course in choosing the swing. Over all, this was a gerat purchase.",5
"Starting Small Monkey Novelty Hamper in Brown,  18 x 11 x 24",I only had this hamper for about 2 months before it began to fall apart.  The rods at the top which hold it open busted through the material on both sides so it would no longer stand up straight and open.  Worst hamper I've ever owned hands down.,1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I was expecting something make of a harder plastic, like the one a friend of mine has. This had a more...rubbery dog toy consistancy. My daughter still chews on it, but it doesn't really do much in the way of teething.",3
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"The good:It lasted about 6 months and never leakedIt really did fit my tub well and helped the transistion from sink to tub for bathing.The bad:Once it goes.....it goes.  It developed a slow leak on day and went into the trash.  Felt wasteful, after that we decided to bathe our daughter in a rubbermaid bin instead.  So far so good.",3
"Britax B-Nimble Stroller, Red","You can not go wrong as far as an umbrella travel system that is this light and of this quality for this price. As a father, I am 100% happy with my purchase of this stroller for fast in and outs to the doctors office or the grocery store.",5
"Taggies Rattle, Buddy Dog","I'm an absolute dog lover, so I definitely needed to get my new nephew something dog related. Taggies are for sure the thing now these days! Came in great condition and in great shipping period. Bought a lot of different dog taggies from this company. Hold up well!",5
"Evenflo Portable BabySuite 300, Marianna","I would've have given it 5 stars bit the changing part isn't that great, although it is set up conveniently. I really do love this playard. We put baby in it nightly. We added a blanket for padding as the bassinet part felt like more cushion would be better for baby. Very happy with the sturdiness of the product. I only had other reviews to go on. This playard is a lot better than many we looked at in stores. The other ones felt like they'd crumble when force was exerted but this one feels tough when &#34;man handled.&#34; I recommend it for the price, but I don't use the changing table. We have a separate one that is taller so I don't have to bend over as much!",4
Stork Craft Rochester Stages Fixed Side Crib,Our daughter and son in law picked this out at Babies R Us.  We saved over $50. and it is beautiful!!!,5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","We have at least five different sleeping sack.  This time order is  for baby shower gift to a friend. Wonderful design, easy to clean, keep our baby nice and warm.",5
"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso",Very happy with our crib. Was best buy recommended by Baby Bargains book - last edition and the current 2013 edition. Got this for a great price.,5
Tommee Tippee Explora Easi-Roll Bibs,I thought this bib was great but my grandson would have no part of it. I think it felt too stiff and just did not coordinate well with his highchair Bumping the stiff bottom of it.  We will try it again as he gets bigger and maybe is taller so that won't be an issue. Grandma Might borrow it because she could use one now herself...haha,3
Clip-on Baby Stroller Fan (Pink),It was cute - I ordered it - I GOT IT - Looks good on stroller and baby & mommy loves it,5
"Major League Baseball Potty Ring, Boston Red Sox","Great product. Easy to use, and easy to clean. I would recommended this to anyone beginning the potty training chapter.",5
"Safety 1st Grip N' Twist Door Knob Covers Decor, 4-Count","At first I was worried the apparent flimsiness of the product would make for short work from my baby boy. I was wrong, since all he seems to be able to do is spin it around and around on the protected doorknob. All the doorknobs in the hallway grew into defacto toys to play with from one place to the next. And they make for a nice cheap alarm that baby's right outside the bathroom door. :-)",5
"Davinci Jenny Lind 3-in-1 Convertible Crib, Cherry","The crib Is perfect! Good quality, affordable price, easy to set up, and SO cute! The wheels look a little cheap but I had no intention of using them anyway so we just left them off. I really love this crib and can't wait to see the baby sleeping in it.",5
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado","I normally like planetwise bags, but this one had the stitching on the elastic give after only 2 washes.  I still use it, but 1/3 of the elastic around the top of the bag is no longer stitched on.",3
"Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue","So as many reviewers noted you really aren't needing to keep track of diaper changes and naps after the first few days, your baby lets you know when he needs changing and he will sleep when he's ready. Though it was comforting to have those settings in the first few days just to try and keep up some sort of routine (for yourself, your baby you will find does not care to follow any sort of routine for a while) and they had me tracking these things in the hospital so it was comforting to come home and keep tracking for a few days.  Made me feel everything was ""normal"" with my baby.By the end of the first week I was not using this for anything but timing nursing sessions...and I'm still using two months later. Yes it is best to feed on demand and not try to impose a feeding schedule on your baby, but the timer helped me figure out that my baby likes to eat almost exactly every 3 hrs during the day and I'm not always watching the clock to see exactly what time it is at each feeding.  Nice to use the timer and if I'm doing errands I can see if it's coming up on 3 hrs, I know to grab a snack soon if I'm hungry or not start a project that will go unfinished. And yes baby is sometimes hungry at different times but the timer helps me see when maybe he's going through a growth spurt and wants a few extra feedings, or when he's ready to sleep an extra hour in the night (hallelujah!).  It's just very helpful for someone like me who needs organization, I carry this timer everywhere so I know if I need to hurry up the grocery store trip, or if I might have an hour til the next feeding to try and lay down.  Added bonus is the nightlight since this sits on my nightstand through the night, less harsh than my usual cell phone and shuts off after 7 minutes. Also I used the left/right breast tracker on the bottom for quite a while.",5
"Neat Solutions Disposable Bib, Princess, 10-Count",We used these on a recent vacation so we didn't have to worry about carrying around or cleaning bibs.  I liked that it has the pocket to help catch fallen food.,5
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"I think the blanket looks good - I like the design and colors. It folds up really easily. The size is comfortable for my husband, my daughter, and me. Perfect for spending time outside.I've given this as a gift multiple times too, and it has always been a hit!",5
Disney Princess Jeweled Trellis 4-pc. Toddler Bed Set,My daughter is happy with these sheets and they cleaned up like new after she was sick all over them. They fit the toddler bed mattress just right.,5
"Withings Smart Baby Monitor, White",Nice monitor with the possibility of panning in and out and changing angles of view from your iPhone. Lullaby is cute and good to fall asleep with. And you can speak with your child through the monitor while away.The batteries should last longer though when not plugged in wall.,5
LillyBit Uptown Diaper Clutch - Chevron,"This diaper clutch has totally exceeded my expectations.  It's so cute and stylish and I never want to use my big diaper bag again.  What I love about it is that it doesn't even look like a diaper bag!! Once I stuffed it with the wipes case and diapers, I was amazed at all the space still available for all my little neccessities and my baby's.  I have already ordered 2 more to give as gifts!!",5
Chomp &amp; Clack Alligator by Melissa &amp; Doug,"We purchased this product at a local educational toy store for my 1 year old for his first birthday. As far as its use as a walker, it is VERY sturdy. We have owned plastic walkers in the past and this one is substantially sturdier (as in, it won't tip over as easily when baby pulls up on it) It does require some basic assembly, I think it was just putting two screws in. The wheels have a rubber ring around them so it gets very good traction on wood or carpeted floors. As the toy is pushed the alligators open and close their mouths at regular intervals. Great fun for chomping sisters' barbie dolls. All three of my boys (ages 1, 2, and 4) LOVE this toy and frequently fight over it (so that could be good OR bad depending on how you look at it!) The only caveat to this toy is the NOISE, when pushed quickly it lives up to the 'clack' part of the name, it clacks LOUDLY. That is the only reason I didn't give this toy a 5. However, I highly recommend it.",4
Playskool: Busy Chase 'N Crawl Duckies,"I would never pay $14 for this toy. I picked mine up for $0.50 at a yardsale. That said, I do like this toy. My daughter hates tummy time and will scream if you put her down on her belly. She loved spinning the ducks and actually stayed on her tummy for a good 15 minutes! Some of the reviews about getting hands stuck in it are a bit worrisome, I can see it happening. I'll have to keep an eye on how she plays with it, but anything that keeps her focused during tummy time is a win.",4
Temporary Earrings by bINK'd GLOW IN DARK Moon &amp; Glow In Dark Stars Combo,"The earrings are kind of cheesy, but work fine for my five year old.  I like the fact they are temporary since she won't get her ears pierced for real.",3
Carters 5 Piece Diaper Bag Set - Black &amp; Sage,"From outside looks nice and has big pockets, when you look inside does not have any poccket or elastics to pressure the bottles or something.but it's ok.",3
"Cosco Slim Fold High Chair, Casey","Works ok.  very stable and sturdy. My only complaint is that it doesn't fold flat, so when I hang it on the wall the foot rest holds it away from the wall. Otherwise it's great.",4
"Everything Kids 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set, Dinosaurs",Bought this set for my 2 yr old nephews birthday. He is currently into dinosaurs and loves the new set. They are easily washed and the colors haven't faded a bit almost 6months out. Keeps him warm and he loves pointing out the different Dino's and telling me their names,5
Infantino Where's My Tail Puzzle,"We bought this for our daughter's second birthday.  She has recently shown more interest in puzzles and can do most peg puzzles on her own.  She absolutely loves this.  It is fun for her to find the matches, say the animal names or sounds, and put the pieces together.  She sometimes needs help, but she can usually put the pieces together by herself once she has a match.  This is a nice intermediate puzzle to move her to the next level from peg puzzles to regular ones and a great activity to do together.  The pieces are very sturdy, but a child who is used to wood puzzles needs to be watched or they may chew on the pieces.",5
"Safety 1st OnBoard 35 Infant Car Seat, Regal Blue",I purchased this car seat in November 2011 for my little boy whom I had on thanksgiving. It is amazing he is 19 months old now & we just switched him into a front facing seat. Although he could have stayed in this because it goes to 35  pounds & he was still in it comfortably. The color is even prettier in person it's a teal & black cute design it adjust with him and he never was cramped. It is a little heavy especially carrying him in it & its a little bigger than other car seats. But we love it! Also was really easy to install & no handy mannys in my house lol.,5
SoHo Froggies Pond Baby Infant Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,It is pretty but it's cheap made. I put it in the washer and all the filling went to one side. I'd pay a few bucks more and get something of better quality.,3
Yummi Pouch (Set of 6),I would suggest saving your money.  I bought a set of these and ended up throwing them away.  They're very hard to clean and I don't like where the spout is located.,2
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","We just received our Moby Wrap today in the mail. It got here in 2 days and we couldn't be happier! My seven week old baby girl is sound asleep in it right now as I type. I wish I had gotten one of these when my son was smaller. It is a huge help while caring for a 21 month old and a 5 year old on top of a newborn. It's truly hands free but if your out and about or doing things around the house and you feel like giving your baby a squeeze they are right there on your chest to hold and cuddle. I am a busy stay at home mom and really needed a way to wear my baby comfortably because I always felt that I had to set her down and I wasn't getting enough cuddle time (they are only this little once right?) Well I found my solution, so worth the forty five dollars it cost me. I had no problem getting it on and baby in. Before I purchased I went on youtube and watched tons of moby wrap tutorials which really helped when I got it. It probably took 5 tries the first time to get it perfect for us. It is Extremely comfortable and soft. The weight is distributed evenly and doesnt hurt my back at all which is a huge plus for me as I have a bad lower back and often get shoulder pain when carrying baby. I gave the Moby Wrap 5 starts because it is exactly what we needed and although we have only been using it for one day I already cant imagine everyday life without it!",5
"Britax Pioneer 70 Harness-2-Booster Car Seat, Kiwi",I am still judging by the reviews as our little guy is a couple of pounds shy of being able to use his new car seat.  But he was very excited abut it. Fast shipping.  Thanks!,5
Summer Infant Cradler - Pink,"I brought this product about 2 months ago for my 2 year old daughter (appx 35 lbs/36 inches). We use it on long and short trips. The support works well and attaches to both ends using velcro. I notice that if you detach the pillows a toddler will be more comfortable. Otherwise, I think this was a great purchase",5
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",MY WIFE IS SUPER HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT. I WOULD DEFINETLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANY ONE LOOKING FOR A PREGNANCY PILLOW.,5
Leachco Back 'N Belly Replacement Cover,"This replacement cover is great, at lactancy period this will be really useful to change pillow's cover.I'm rating this 4 stars, because image product is misleading. I bought this thinking it was the pillow, and if you look at the comment's all are about the pillow, an not about the product itself that IS A COVER REPLACEMENT. I think I got really excited about this pillow that I dind't read correctly the title, but if you compare pillow's image with this cover is the same image.",4
"Dabbawalla Lunch Bag, Cute as a Bug","I've been thinking about buying a Dabawalla bag for my son for a few years now and finally pulled the trigger this year for the start of school. My husband expressed some concern that the design looked a bit like a purse in the pictures (there is nothing wrong with that - he was just wondering if our son might be teased).The lunch bag does not look like a purse in real life. It is really adorable, with vibrant colors, an awesome design, and the quality looks very good (stitching and so forth). The neoprene is pretty stretchy, which is good for fitting lunch items inside, but if you have a heavier lunch one day (like when I use a Thermos), it sags a little on the bottom when carried by the handle.Inside the bag, there is a large main space, a &#34;netted&#34; area on one long side (I put a cold pack or granola bars or other small flat items there) and the drink space in the corner. I can comfortably fit a 12 oz Klean Kanteen in the corner space. I'm pretty sure Dabawalla says you can fit a larger bottle there, but I find a 12 oz size is the right fit if you want it to fit upright in the netted corner.Here are my main issues with the bag:-There is just a hair too much stretch in the neoprene. It always goes back to the original shape, but I don't like the sag when I have a larger lunch packed.-I was under the impression that the neoprene material was supposed to provide some (even minor) temperature control. It doesn't. You will need a cold pack (and more on that in a moment) - don't mistake this for an insulated lunch box.- The bag sweats. So if you are going to put a cold pack inside, make sure it has a sweat-proof cover (I have the overpriced Kids Konserve and that does NOT work well), or the neoprene fabric will become damp on the outside.-The zipper area is a little small. I always expect it to open a little differently and sometimes tug on the zipper farther than it's supposed to go. I sometimes wonder if my son has this problem at school during the day.-The bag is easy to wipe clean, but I thought you could gentle cycle this and air dry regularly. The instructions tell you that the bag will only hold up to that type of cleaning 5 or 6 times. So plan on wipe cleaning. For this price, you want the bag to last.So, I DO like this lunch bag and I would most likely buy it again. It is a little expensive for what I feel we actually got (in other words, some of the features I was using to justify the price aren't exactly what I thought they would be), but none of the problems are major enough to keep it from being practical. I would strongly urge researching the backpack version of this bag before buying because I can't really imagine the weight of school materials not creating way too much sag.",4
Susen Safe Shampoo Shower Bathing Protect Soft Cap Hat for Baby Children Kids (Pink),"I wasn't sure if this would actually work or not because it was so cheap, but it does work, and my 3 year old daughter likes wearing it in the tub to keep the water out of her eyes when I wash her hair. I recommend it.",5
The First Years 2 Pack Disney Cars II Sunshade,I am using them for my son as well as daughter and they both loves them all time its well design and perfect sun shade for any size car window,5
Munchkin Baby Care Cart,"I Do NOT recommend buying. This was purchased for my babies room while we were waiting for the military to ship our belongings to our new post. My husband set it up exactly how he was supposed to. I just used it for diapers, wipes, lotion, onesies, socks... Things like that. My 3yo went to grab a diaper off the top, she hardly touched it and the who thing fell right on top of her. We had nothing heavy in it so she wasn't hurt but it sure did scare her. Threw it out the same day. Not sturdy. I know parents don't want to take chances with the safety on their little ones. Badger basket has way nicer/stronger products. This was a waste of money and a safety hazard.",1
Sesame Street Elmo Plush Baby / Toddler Blanket,"We bought 2 (one for school, one for home).  Cute and pretty durable - it has been through many washes and it is holding up well.  My son calls it 'Melmo.'",5
Tree of Life Growth Chart,"I bought this for a friend, much nicer than the cheap plastic versions.  Looks like a piece of artwork and you can hang it anywhere.",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I found this monitor has great range and is very clear.  I used it when I lived in an apartment in chicago that was in a very old brick building.  My apartment was on the top (3rd) floor and I could run down and check the mail and hear perfectly clearly through old floors and brick walls.  I even did tests with it with my husband, where I'd go outside and walk around and still heard crystal clear.  I'm not sure why some others said that it had bad range.  I did sometimes hear my neighbors phone converstaions through the receiver from their nextel phones.",5
Nebraska Huskers Pacifier Set,I put these on my baby registry and I'm glad I didn't buy them myself.  Both of them quickly lost the Huskers logo and now even the black stripe is almost gone.But my baby does love this pacifier better than the one from the hospital!,3
Super Why Insulated Straw Cup,I think it is awesome to see Super Why on a cup!  Our youngest loves the show.  We have had this style of cup before and it is pretty nice.  I like the straw being bigger because it makes it a lot easier to clean....I hate cups with tiny straws.,5
"Mother's Day Custom Baby Footprint Necklace Kit, Made in the USA","I got my footprint necklace from the Jak Figler Design website. I had three children at the time and was able to get the necklace just the way I wanted it.. Now I have just given birth to my fourth and can't wait to have him added!! The process was so easy and they were so helpful with any questions. I have a great necklace, that I constantly get compliments on!!!!",5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",We take our stroller everywhere. My 2 yr old loves to go on walks now that we have this stroller. I think we will wear out the tires long before the rest of the stroller shows any wear. great buy to those with two little ones. Its lightweight and easy to manuver.,5
"JJ Cole Pacifier Clip, Multi Circle","The metal clips are better. The plastic clip is clunky and doesn't stay clipped to clothes. The colors are pretty, but it just isn't effective.",2
Sassy Baby's First Rattle and Teether 5 Piece Gift Set,"These toys are wonderful.  They fit little, chubby hands and keep my son's interest.  He loves the bright colors and he especially loves to teeth on the fish.  The butterfly stays cold for at least an hour after taking it out of the freezer.  He loves both sides of it and will talk it.  These are also great to throw in the diaper bag, because they are small.  We also keep at least one in the car for him to play with in his carseat.  Definitely a 5 star product!",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I like some features of the Diaper Champ. I do not find that it is odorless at all. I do like the one-handed operation of it. However, my toddler is constantly putting things in it and I have to paw through the dirty diapers to see what he's thrown away before I dispose of the bag. Using regular trash bags is nice, but I think there is something to be said for scented liners.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,The Jumperoo was a great product and has met all of my expectations.  The price was right and it will be perfect for a 6 month old baby.,5
"Mud Pie Ornament, Handprint","We had trouble getting a good imprint, but that may have also been due to our son only being 12 weeks old at the time.",3
"Britax Advocate 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","Love this car seat! Met and exceeded my expectations. Love all the features! Have no complaints whatsoever. Haven't noticed any quirks or inconveniences. We've had this seat for about 2 months now. My son still fits in his infant carrier (not a Britax), but I was ready to transition to this seat because it has way more safety features, more energy-absorbing foam, and more padding.It's very difficult to find safety test information on car seats, but I chose this seat because it had the most safety features by far. Britax also has the best website which explains and demonstrates all their unique safety features in detail. This seat appears to be great quality. Very sturdy. Easy to install rear-facing (haven't used forward-facing yet). The fabric is beautiful. Love the included strap covers. The hugs pads are easy to use. The Click Safe feature works well and has been accurate for us. I usually tighten it a touch more after the first click. My son is about 18 pounds and 27 inches and fits this seat comfortably. The EZ buckle system effectively makes getting him into the seat easier. I love the TrueSide Impact Protection (extra cushioning around the head). The Quick-Adjust No Re-Thread harness works great. I also like the Versa-Tether, which we easily installed to the front seat mount.",5
"Teddy Needs a Bath Dryer Sheets, Cotton Candy Scented",This really takes away any smell that could be on a stuffed animal. The cotton candy smell is good without being too overpowering.,5
"Munchkin Latch BPA-Free Bottle, 8 Ounce, 2 Count",We didn't have the luxury of taking off from work for vary long after the baby was born so right away we had to buy a breast pump and stockpile milk.  The baby bottle market is pretty crowded but what sets the Munchkin design apart is how it simulates the breast - making the transition from breast to bottle easier for the baby. The accordion like flexible joint at the base of the nipple makes a huge difference. The 8 Oz bottles are handy for daytime.,5
BRICA Cover Guard Car Seat Travel Tote,"Car seats travel free!! Take advantage of it! I was on the fence of the wheels vs the backpack until I saw this one! This has the wheel or backpack option but my boyfriend preferred the backpack.  It's not as heavy on your back as you would expect.  We took a Safety 1st Convertible Car seat & shoved a no back booster seat in there.  Also fitted in there was diapers, wipes, shoes, jackets---remember: Car Seats Travel FREE! Load it up to lighten your luggage or to provide more space in your luggage.",5
"Summer Infant Mother's Touch Deluxe Baby Bather, Blue",I brought this for my cousin and she loves this so much. It arrived just in time for her to come home with the baby,5
"Bumkins Flushable Diaper Liner, Neutral, 100 Pack","We got these for our toddler, who doesn't always have the most 'formed' poos.  They have worked amazingly in keeping the soft stuff off of the actual diaper, so in that sense, they live up to their purpose (We use a prefold folded in thirds, wrap the liner around it, and laid like a pad in a cover).  However, he ends up with quite a bit of fuzz all over his bottom and little boy parts, which is a huge pain to try and clean off of a squirming two year old.  I will try a different brand of liners after these run out, and hopefully we will be able to find ones that don't shed!Edited to add: We've been using these for our 3 week old, because he had a diaper rash that needed a cream that wasn't cloth diaper safe, and even when placed in the diaper folded, the cream still gets on the diaper.  So they really don't seem to be of much use for that purpose.  They also get very bunched up, much more so than with our 22 month old, probably because we use folded and fastened prefolds, so there isn't anything to wrap the liner around to keep it in place.  I would imagine they would do the same with an AIO or a pocket diaper, too.",3
"Summer Infant Swaddleme Muslin Sack, Reptiles","I love this swaddleme blanket; it is kind of hard to rate this type of simple product. It is nice and thin- perfect for summer! I still put the baby in a short sleeve onesie, because we are running an AC, but it is light enough to be worry free- you won't cook your baby. Muslin is a highly breathable material, so I definitely recommend for those muggy days.The ONLY reason why I gave this item 4 out of 5 starts, because zipper goes up and that zipper puller is in baby's face/chin/neck. That is just too bad. Why not just have it zip down? Eghhhhh",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,It is such a convenient gate.  Very sturdy.  A 5 year old can barely open it even if they know how.  LOVE IT,5
"Tailored, Pleated Crib Bed Skirt Cotton 14&quot; drop Ivory","The color looks peach.  I even asked a couple others to look at it and they said, without knowing that it was supposed to be ivory, ""oh, that looks like a light peach color"" - not good for a neutral-themed nursery!  It's over-priced, stiff, and most importantly, NOT ivory!!  Now, I'm having problems with the seller.  I returned the item three weeks ago and haven't been reimbursed yet (non-Amazon seller, which I'm learning is not the way to go on here), but Amazon is officially looking into it for me now.",1
"Grandma &amp; Grandpa Embroidery Baby Bib, Blue - Grandma","I first bought these bibs for my son because we were having trouble finding a simple boy's bib that said """"I love grandpa"""". I received so many compliments on it (especially from the grandparents) that I now give them as shower gifts. They held up well through 2 years of washing with no fading or loose stitching.",5
Snuza Portable Baby Movement Monitor,"We bought a snuza when our daughter was a few weeks old. It definitely gave us piece of mind when laying her down for the night.I love that it is portable, we have gone out of town quite a few times (she is now 6 months) and are still able to use it.When our daughter turned 3 months, the snuza began acting up. It started beeping uncontrollably. I contacted snuza customer support on the snuza website and got a response instantly. They tried to troubleshoot, then told me that they would send us a replacement snuza at no cost. We got a new snuza a few days later and have not had a problem since. I have recommended this to all of my friend with infants, and as a NICU nurse, I would also recommend it to my patients families.",5
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"My son loves his exersaucer - he loves to jump up and down.  However, his chubby hands get caught under the plastic dragon ball with the beads.  It gets jammed in there pretty good then he gets scared and cries.  I'm afraid he's going to hurt himself.  It gets really stuck under the ball and sometimes it takes me a couple of minutes to get it out.  I put a bib in that area, so his hand can't slip down there anymore.  I love the toy, but would recommend the safari version (which comes without that dragon ball).",3
Munchkin Twisty Figure 8 Teether,"This teether has rubber sides, and smooth plastic sides.  Baby can twist it around and have a good time smacking you and himself with it.  If you are a nervous wreck that doesn't want to be smacked with a teether, then maybe the knuckleball one would be better for you.  But the baby seems to have a good time biting this one and waving it around and smacking himself with it.  Baby likes it; it gets on my nerves.  But I give it 5 stars because baby likes it.",5
Baby's Journey Towel Warmer PLUS Bath Sponge,price could be lower for what your getting constantly having to turn back on cold by the time you put baby clothes or towel on them unless hitting on button every time it goes off for 6-10 min. minimum and using right away too gets cold fast but warming nonstop what for buttons on baby clothes before putting on so they are not too hot don&#8217;t use sponge part cost less to get it with than without,3
"Joovy Caboose Too Ultralight Stroller, Black","We have a baby and toddler and have been very dissatisfied with this product. Issues: we can't reach basket when pushing both kids, toddler can easily reach and mess with baby, toddler can put his feet on the wheels and stop stroller, awkward pushing - you hit the back of toddler seat as you are walking, the space is very small for the toddler in back. Lastly, we broke a part of the stroller that helps collapse it when closing it last week - granted this could have been a user error:) Most importantly - we couldn't use this as a double stroller with our baby's carseat (the toddler seat won't fit in it with the infant car seat). Hope this helps.",2
"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red",I bought this stroller because I needed a decent light weight stroller that was sturdier than the regular umbrella strollers. I also needed it to not  take  up too much room when folded in my car. It is great and I am very happy!,4
"Delta Enterprise Corp Silverton 4 In 1 Crib, Dark Cherry",I have had to the the company three times because of poor craftmenships of this crib. The back rail was poorly made but they still painted it. The holes on the right side rail were on the wrong side. Now they tell me that the right side rail is on back or and they don't know when it will come in.,1
"Inglesina 2011 Fast Table Chair, Marina","This chair has been working very well for us. We've had it several months and use it on a daily basis. I have it set up at our kitchen bar. Originally, I had highchair but it just took up to much room. This little chair allows my children to eat meals side by side at the kitchen bar. Love it! Easy to clean and its so nice that it has an extra pocket for bibs and stuff. Great for travel- there is an attached travel bag which everything fits into. Love that its attached - one less thing to worry about while traveling.",5
Faux Suede Roll Brim Hat &amp; Booties Set - Blue: 0-6 Months,"As a yak farmer on the cold steppes of Mongolia, I spend all day on horseback along with my wife and children.  All our kids learned to ride before they learned to walk, but our newest, who is only two-months old, travels with my wife in a snug bundle wearing the faux suede roll brim hat and booties.  Why faux suede?  Just because we're yak farmers doesn't mean we don't keep up appearances and follow the latest fashions.  Sure, we may go months before seeing our nearest neighbors, but when we do meet, you can be sure we are eyeing each other to see who is wearing what, and our kids are just as fashion conscious, if not more so, as the adults.  With his faux suede roll brim hat and booties, now our two-month old can keep his overlarge head held up high knowing that his parents are not only looking out for his welfare but his savoir-faire as well.",5
"Britax Car Seat Travel Bag, Black",Torn all over after first trip.  We bought two of them. I had better luck using the $12 red bags.,1
Nursery-To-Go Lady Bug Lucy 10 Piece Bedding Set,My wife picked this out after looking all over the internet. I've only had to deal with the valance thing and wall hangings and they both look a little cheap. The valance is really short so if you have a window that is wider than 33 inches or so you may want to buy a second one. We also bought the lamp shade but it still has not shipped (we ordered it over a month ago). Overall it is okay but I feel we got a better deal with our sons crib set which cost about $10 less than this one.,3
"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light , Blue","I bought this for our first international trip to Asia, and it fit perfectly in the luggage. Lightweight and very easy to set up. When we came back from the trip, somehow my 8 months old daughter did not want to sleep in her crib at all. I had to co-sleep since she felt insecure and just kept screaming for an hour every time I put her in the crib. Maybe becoz of the constant changing environment. Anyway, I finally decided to try this crib at home, and for seven nights straight, I put her inside without her screaming like crazy. What a relief!!",5
"Safety 1st Deluxe Infant-to-Toddler Tub, White","My baby is still only 7 weeks old, so I haven't gotten to use it without the netting.  However, I can say that we all really love this tub.  Our kitchen is pretty small, so we use this in our bath tub.  It is very sturdy.  It has lots of places where we can put the shampoo and bedtime bath stuff so its within reach.  I was a little concerned about the places where the newborn net attach to the tub.  So far, its held on very tightly.  My baby is now almost 12 lbs and he is very safe and secure in that net.I'm so glad I went with this tub.",5
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","I only bought one of these to try them out (we've also used BumGenius, Flip, and Happy Heiny's) and have been very impressed with them!! Not bulky at all, and have a slim fit. Our 4 month old is pretty average sized, and she is still at the smallest sizing... very soft and durable!",5
"Regalo Top of Stair Gate, White","I had a 10 month old grandson that I needed to keep from climbing the stairs, as I mounted mine at the bottom of the stairway as opposed to the top.  Very easy to mount, although I ended up changing to larger drywall anchors once my hulk of a grandson loosened up the wall-side of the gate.  It's worked great since, although he's not happy. :)",5
"Britax Roundabout 55 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","I was reluctant at first to spend more on a carseat but after reading reviews and safety ratings, I took the plunge. I have NO regrets. This seat is worth every penny. From first observations I was impressed with the sturdiness of it compared to our previous seat. I feel very safe with my daughter in it. Also the higher weight limit will keep her safe for several years.",5
"Nuby 2 Handle Cup With Soft Spout, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary",It works and my 8 month old daughter can use it. I think it may be better for kids over age 1. my daughter is just learning to use a sippy cup and this one is too big and needs a lot of liquid since she is not tipping it high enough to drink. The top is rubber and has two bumps on the sides which should line up in two grooves but it is hard to get them to line up. It is very easy to clean but I am not sure about the spout because I think it traps stuff. So far I only have put water in the cup but it seams to trapping dish soap because after a few tips it seems that the water has bubbles in it. I squeeze the spout in all different directions when I rinse but I feel like it just isn't rinsing well.,3

Maxboost Fusion Snap-on iPhone 5S/5 Case - Navy Blue (Fit Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5S/5),"I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation. The case was a bit thinner than I was expecting, and for some people that may not be a bad thing. I was a bit weary that it might not be very sturdy (I'm someone who drops my phone a lot). While the jury is still out on whether the case is shock proof like my last case, I still like the case. I think the color is great, it has a great feel to it, and it really showcases the design of the phone. I will say, some of the openings aren't very crisp, meaning that you can see a little excess plastic around the button holes and on one of the edges. Overall, the case is okay, and I think you definitely get your money's worth out of it.",4
Summer Infant Newborn-To-Toddler Bath Center &amp; Shower,"I agree with all the above posts. The shower button feature was really hard to press and use, even for my husband our fingers would be sore by the end of giving a bath. Our daughter loved it but in the end of its use (which wasnt for very long) it died on us and now we cant even use it for our next baby. I am a big advocate of Summer Infant products almost everything I have is from them and good quality, but as for this tub, look elsewhere.",1
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue","bought for use as reusable diaper wipes.  it does the job.  don't need too much thickness and absorbency for diaper wipes so it own't use too much wipe solution.  a little big for the disposable wipes container but works.after a year or so of much use and abuse, they are getting small holes and the edge stitching is a little messed up.  still held up and will probably be okay for a second baby.",3

"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","Went shopping for a bumbo, got this instead because it has toys for my son to play with, plus can be used in multiple ways.It is as advertised, the quality is good enough. It is pretty stable and the 360 table is a great feature.We hope to use it a lot longer.My piece was missing a few parts, contacted the customer service and they shipped the parts the next day.As my son loves it, I would recommend this for your kids.",4
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","My daughter started preschool and picked out this lunchbox.  I let her choose which animal she wanted.  We have had the Skip Hop bumblebee backpack for a couple years so I knew the quality would not be a problem, however I was worried, based on some reviews, that it would be too small for her lunch.  She is attending a preschool that only allows reusable containers and organic, unprocessed, no sugar added food, so her lunchbox has to have enough room to pack containers of the good stuff!  This lunch box works perfectly!  I can pack a thermos (soup, pasta) and fruit, yogurt, etc all in this lunchbox.  Today I packed 4 containers of various sizes.  Best of all, my daughter loves it and is very happy to carry it to school each day!",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sounds Full Color Video and Audio Monitor,"I never comment on products but have depended heavily on other's comments in the past (especially for baby products).  I thought it was about time I return the favor others have done.  GREAT product, works extremely well.  Picture and sound are great.  We have large house and have not lost the signal.  Perfect if you have a baby who wakes without crying out (but likes to try to escape).",5

"Luna Lullaby Bosom Baby Nursing Pillow, Chocolate Dot","I bought this pillow after my daughter was born and absolutely love it.  It's great for feeding her, as well as playing on the floor or just snuggling on the couch.  It's very soft, but keeps it's shape.  The cover comes off for washing and is easy to put back on. I have a boppy pillow as well, but continually come back to this pillow because it's so much softer and nicer. Highly recommend.",5

Lexnfant Silicone Collapsible Pacifier Case - Pink,Wouldn't recommend this &iacute;tem. The pacifier falls out easily. Looks nice but doesn't really work since the lid does not have a firm grasp.,1
American Red Cross Door Knob Cover - 3 Pack,"Our front door opens up right onto steps, about 14 or so. I was worried that my 15 month old son would open the door one day we forgot to lock it, or figure out how to unlock the door stumble outside and tumble down the stairs. These fixed that problem. HE can reach up and grab the handle but with the door knob cover he can't open the door. He did rip off the cap that covers the lock part, but he can't reach in and grab the lock yet. Sometimes the knob cover starts to come apart( there are 2 pieces that clip onto each other) but it is easy to fix it when ever you go outside since you have to grab it to open the door.It just took a little bit to get used to the cover, but the peace of mind it brings is excellent.",4
Mommy's Helper Toilet Seat Lid-Lok,"This product is easy to install but it is a little loose. The lid can still be lifted a half inch or so on our toilet. If your toilet is next to a wall, I would recommend installing it on the side closer to the wall to minimize the temptation for your child to tamper with it.",4
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"exceeded my expectations, light weight and easy to put up and take down.",5
"Safety 1st Go Hybrid Convertible Booster, Waterloo","-This seat had high ratings, which is great.-It's very slimline, which I needed.-It is made up of sections of cushioned fabric, the plastic seat base and straps, so it's NOT freestanding (no traditional plastic backbone/shell ).  As a result, it only work",4

MEDICINE NURSER DISPENSER MERRI TOTS BPA FREE,Poor! Poor! Poor Quality. Hard nipple and not friendly for babies. I was not impressed. My son did not like it and the medicine spilled.,1
Safety 1st Lift Lock and Swing Gate,"This gate is total crap. It doesn't fit well in our doorway, it is difficult to get it to slide to the right distance, and will not easily adapt to more than one doorway (if you can even get it to fit ONE doorway).  I'm so disappointed in this product that I'm writing my first review EVER (after reading them for years) because it's a total waste of money and hopefully I can save some others the hassle.  I didn't think I wanted to spend more than $40 on a baby gate, after toying with this gate for over an hour, I'd pay $100. Totally dissatisfied.",1
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,"I purchased this stool with the matching seat cover for my daughter for potty training.  I like that the top has a non-slip cover on it to keep my daughter from slipping when getting up on the toilet.  She really likes that she has her own special stool for going potty, it has helped in encouraging her to start potty training.",5
The First Years Baby Bundle,This is wonderful... a cozy little blanket right in the car seat.  It has come in very handy!  My daughter loves it!,5
The First Years miPump Double Electric Breast Pump,"I am an exclusively pumping mom, so I'm pretty hard on this pump. I use it 10 minutes at a time up to 10 times a day. My daughter is 5 weeks old, and so far it's held up wonderfully. It's small and easily portable, relatively quiet, and extremely efficient. I can pump out 8 ounces easily in 10 minutes using both pumps, and still have a hand free. Now the cons. My only real issue is the lack of a speed setting. I would prefer a slower suction, but the pump is still very efficient. Also, the breast shields are a bit small for me, and I have been unable to find larger ones. But, having tried other, more expensive pumps that were not nearly as convenient or efficient, I have to say this one offers big value on a small budget.",4

Hospital's Choice Fold Up Nail Clippers,"Clipping baby nails is one of the most stressful things. This nail clipper is small, but handles very well and the thicker handles make it an easier process. Well-made... we have been using ours for over 2 years without problems.",5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo,"My baby girl LOVES this jumper! She is almost 8 months old, but she's loved this thing since she was a little baby. When she first went in it, she couldn't really jump or anything (too young), but she loved to stare at the toys and play with them. Now she goes in it all the time and bounces around and plays with the toys. She can now reach the hippo and monkey and loves to play with them. I really think her favorite place to be (besides Mommy holding her) is in this bouncer! :)There are a lot of toys for her to play with. The seat spins so she's able to see them all.  The seat seems like it's comfortable and flexible. The music isn't too annoying, in my opinion. This bouncer is adjustable to 3 different heights.The only downside was that it took a while for her to be able to reach the floor, even on the lowest setting. She IS kinda on the short side, so that's part of it. But when she couldn't reach, she wasn't quite old enough to bounce around anyway, and she still loved to look at the toys. Now she can reach really well and she bounces and bounces and bounces for EVER! She lovvvvves it.",5
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby",This was super easy to install (it slipped right onto the faucet and has stayed there ever since). My daughter has slipped and knocked her head against the covered faucet and didn't even flinch.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a bathtub faucet cover with a shower pull.,4
bumGenius One-Size Cloth Diaper Twilight,"These diapers are amazing! the snaps on them truly do allow them to be small enough for a small baby, and grow w/ your child. The elastic on the legs and back have been excellent and prevent leaks and messes. I love the colors, and they are so easy to use and care for. The cost is well worth the product. After trying 2 diapers along with disposables for a few weeks, I decided to buy 18 more! We are now exclusively cloth diapering with these BumGenius One-Size 3.0's!",5
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack, Lavender or Citrus","Love the size and style of these little fresheners, but they lack the most important part of there job.  They don't work well at all.  I put one in my babies diaper container and it didn&#8217;t make any difference.  So I put another one thinking it would do a better job having a companion, but I was wrong again.  I am thinking of putting all of them in the container next.  Love the concept but was sad that they didn&#8217;t do the job.  Note to Arm & Hammer:  Put some sticky adhesive on the back of these little guys and make them a lot stronger!  Thanks for reading my post.",2
"Boon Flo Water Deflector and Protective Faucet Cover with Bubble Bath Dispenser,Green","First the bad : we have a standard Moen tub faucet.  The Flo doesn't *quite* sit right on the faucet, so we have to play with it a bit to get all the water to go down the slope, rather than out the back of the Flo.  But it's not really a big deal, just takes a bit of adjusting.The good :  My daughter (11 months old) loves to play with the water coming from the faucet.  The Flo allows her to sit a little further back (thus sparing me stress every time she gets a little tippy!), and she also really delights in the waterfall effect.  When she gets older, I think the bubble bath dispenser will be more appreciated.Speaking of which, other reviewers have mentioned the bubble bath leaking out -- I have seen a few drops in the ""scoop"" under the faucet, but nothing major.  It's been on a week, and I've yet to need to refill it.I haven't had any problems with mess with this either.  Even when I didn't have it adjusted just right and water was washing backwards under the faucet, it didn't go everywhere, it just ran down the tub side (INSIDE the tub).If it wasn't for the slightly finicky adjustment necessary, I'd have given this 5 stars!",4

"Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature Milk Feeding Bib, Pink, 2 Count",My daughter wants more for their baby. It keeps her neck dry when breast or bottle feeding and it is comfortable for mother and baby. I wish these were around when I had babies.  I hated the milk pooling around their necks.  A MUST for every baby.,5
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"I chose this Pack'n Play because it was on sale. I'm happy with it. It folds up easily and is of good quality. The extras turned out to be not very useful, mainly because my baby was already three months old when I ordered it, and she was already close to the weight limit of 15 lbs for the bassinet. The hanging toys don't travel well and are a little lame, besides being useless without the bassinet. We plan to have more children, though, so we'll be able to use the bassinet then. It will still make a great play pen and travel bed.",4
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","I didnt find the motor to be loud at all.  This keeps my 4month old occupied while i get ready for work, sometimes even falls asleep to it.  He will lay under it and make all sorts of noise for a good hour!!  The only downfal(if u would even call it that) is that the remote has to be pretty close and right in line for the eye to read it and turn it on.  Just as easy to press the buttonsLove it!",4
"Medela Easy Expression Hands-Free Bustier, White, Small","This Pumping bra was disappointing. Suck it up and pay the extra $12 bucks for the Simple Wishes pumping bra. First of all, the sizes on this thing is WAY OFF. Its sized way TOO SMALL, so whatever size the chart claims you are, you have to go at least one size bigger (honestly may be even two). Secondly, the zipper in the front is very flimsy and cheap. Any kind of pressure against it and it will not zip up and/or will pop and become misaligned. This was total pain and I'm not a big person. I wear a 34B and wear a C now that I'm nursing and bought the medium and found it to be ridiculously tight to the point I could barely breath and it totally smashed my boobs. Look if you nurse once in a blue moon, then maybe take the chance, but it you have to pump every day like me, its not worth it. Get something that is more adjustable and true to its size. I would have return this item but I had to take it out of the plastic to realize how badly it fit. I now have the Simple Wishes and its AMAZING. 100x more comfortable and gives you endless options to adjust the bra to your size, plus it comes with straps. But this is just my two sense..",1
Fisher-Price Apptivity Gym for iPhone &amp; iPod Touch Devices,"The best word I have for this is simple. It's simple to fold, simple to carry, simple to put together, and simple to operate. You don't have to use your iPod/iPhone in it but if you do, just search for the Fisher Price apps in the App Store, pop it in it's secure spot and voila! You can also situate your Apple device so that the baby can't or can press the home button. If you don't want to use that function, just switch it around and use the mirror it comes with. I have twins and I found this is also a good tool for tummy time exercises as they can stretch their necks to look up into the mirror and reach up to get the toys. Good buy! Especially if it's on sale!",5
"UPPAbaby Stroller Parent Organizer, Black","Not too bad if you use the car seat in the stroller, but with the standard stroller seat I can't easily move the seat to the recline position without moving the organizer and that's with the handle in the furthest up position. I don't think it would be a problem if the kid was facing me. The stroller seems very well designed and I would have thought the UB organizer would have been the same, I have a feeling in a few years there will be a better version.",2
"NUK Replacement Silicone Spout, Clear","these have NO chance against their ravenous teeth!  My daughter loved to chew on the soft silicone spouts after she finished drinking her formula.  she'd chew it until there was a gaping hole in the middle of the spout.  One time I tore off a small piece of silicone b/c I feared that she may bite it off and swallow it.  So after 4 mangled spouts, I decided it may be cheaper to try a hard spout cup instead of replacing it!  I went with the Playtex Insulator cupPlaytex Disney Playhouse 9 oz Insulator Cup, 2 Pack, Winnie The Poohwhich has been working out great so far.  Please see my review on the Playtex Insulator Cup if interested.Now...the good points:-you can use these with all NUK products!  I already had the 4 oz sippyNUK Learner Cup BPA Free Silicone Spout, Single Pack, Colors May Varywhich my daughter used to transition from bottle to sippy, but needed one that held more ounces.  I only found one NUK sippy with the silicone spout (NUK BPA Free Active Cup With Clip 10 Oz - girl colors).  I wanted more then one, so I just bought regular Nuk 10 oz bottles (NUK Orthodontic Silicone BPA Free Nipple Bottle, 10 Ounce, 3 Pack, Colors May Vary) then ordered additional silicone spouts.  If I had started out with NUK bottles, then all I would've needed was to purchase the spouts to turn it into a sippy.-my daughter loves the Nuk Sippy.  She had no problem transitioning from bottle to sippy with this spout.It IS a silicone spout, therefore not impervious to persistent chompers.  Their soft spout is great on a teething baby's sensitive gums, but its also their weak point.  The bottom line?  If your little one leaves the spouts alone, then this is a great product to have!",4
Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,This dining ware set is awesome for the Thomas and Friends lover in your family.  They'll eat dinner to get to the bottom of that plate.,5
Boppy Prenatal Total Body Pillow,"I bought this while pregnant because of the awful side/hip pain I was having from all of the extra weight. It helped some, but didn't help completely...I'm still rating it 5 stars though because I'm convinced that there wasn't anything that would have helped me at that point.I used it after I had the baby to nurse with. I would sit on the couch with the pillow around me, so that each of my arms would have some pillow to sit them on. Since I'm on the shorter side, it was enough leverage to bring the baby up to the breast to nurse.After the pregnancy, I still use it as a regular pillow sometimes. I fold the thing in half, and it props you up without putting any strain anywhere...great for when you are sick and need to be propped some...and great for the couch.I washed the outside cover without any problems, and it really wasn't that hard to put the pillow back in the cover like I thought it would be.",5
Boogie Wipes Great Grape Scent Gentle Saline Wipes for Stuffy Noses 2pk,I have a preschooler and she couldn't keep her hands off her nose until we got her Boogie Wipes.  She loves them and has motivated her to use the wipe rather than the hand.  They are very effective so we now have them in the house and in the purse.,5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",it secures to the chair. It is easy and convenient to carry anywhere. I love the trays (2). The cover (green) has never been used.I really like that it has levels to put it higher.My baby feels comfortable in it and it is very secure. So that's enough for me.,5

"Vital Baby Press 'n' Pop Mini Freezer Pots, Orange, 1 Ounce, 8 Pack",We got these about 6 weeks ago and have no complaints.  We put hot/just prepared food in them right away and throw them in the freezer.  We have had no trouble microwaving them and clean them in the top rack of the dishwasher.  They are a great alternative to the entire ice tray because you can pack a few with you at a time when going out for the day.,5
"Teutonia T-Linx System, Topaz Green","I bought this travel system about 6 months ago in anticipation of the birth of our 4th child, so we haven't used the carseat portion yet.  However, we've been using the stroller with our two year old since we bought it and I love it. It's sturdy and stylish. My daughter seems comfortable. I like that the seat can be reclined for more comfortable sleeping. The canopy is huge and provides plenty of shade, and has a mesh vent which can be uncovered on warmer days. As other reviewers have mentioned there isn't a cup holder, and the basket is rather small, but I bought it knowing those things so I can't really mark if off for that. There is a pocket on the back of the stroller seat that holds water bottles, sippy cups, etc. One thing I really like is that the brake is on the handle bar, no messing around with a foot break. The handle flips easily so baby can face you or face forward. Folding is fairly simple and can be done with one hand. The latch to lock it closed once folded is a little unwieldy, and I usually just skip it if I'm in a hurry and stick it in the back of the van. It does take up a fair bit of real estate in the back of our Toyota van, not sure how well it'd fit in a smaller car. Overall I really like this stroller.",4
"MAM 3 Pack Anti-Colic Bottle Boy, 8 Ounce, Colors May Vary","These bottles were the perfect solution for my son who gagged on other ""rounded"" nipples.  We were previously using Avent bottles and it was taking him 30-40 minutes to drink his 6oz bottle (he's 10 weeks old).  Since he only took MAM pacis, I decided to give these bottles a try.  It worked like a charm!  He now takes 6oz in 10-15 minutes and does not gag on the nipple because it is more flat.  I am so glad I made the investment to switch!",5
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White","I agree with the other one star review that talks about the plug shredding when attempting to attach the extension. It would not come out without falling apart and once it did the entire gate was useless. All the plugs were flimsy and hard to handle as well. This gate is not worth purchasing. I plan to look for another, non-Munchkin, option.",1
"Piccolo Bambino Cotton Velour 5 Piece Gift Set, Blue","This blanket is so soft even after washing! Also, it is larger than other baby receiving blankets which makes it perfect for swaddling. I'm not a huge fan of the booties, they tie up but the strings are so small so I haven't used them. However, I have used the mittens on my newborn since I brought him home and they work really well although he is able to take them off on his own even though he is a newborn so maybe they are not as well fitting as I would have liked. The doggy is a cute addition to this set as a security blanket.",5
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Early Walker Wearable Blanket, Baby Blue, Large","My 15-month-old son is 31 inches tall and weighs 25 pounds, and the large size fits him beautifully. If I try to cover him with a blanket while he's sleeping, he always manages to kick it off right away, so this Sleep Sack is the perfect solution for the coming winter months. We were big fans of the traditional Sleep Sacks (without the foot holes) last winter when he was just a few months old, so I was excited to discover that there exists a version like this for walkers! Bonus - it's so soft and snuggly!",5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"Doesn't fit the strip we have our computer/tv plugs in. Its too small. We intended it to use there, but are using it in our bedroom instead.",3
"Evenflo Big Kid High Back SI Car Seat Booster, Alexa","Ease of buckling, lights!, two cup holders at an easy to reach level that expand to fit any water bottle or snack cup - all 5 star.",5
Aquaus Toilet Bidet Handle / Diaper Sprayer with ** BONUS ** Rockin' Green Laundry Detergent and Tooth Tissue sample,"I love this sprayer. When I purchased it, I had to think a lot of times because it's a little expensive. Now my husband and I use every time. This one is very easy to install. My husband did not want me to buy it. I wanted it soo bad so I bought it without his knowledge. This is really easy to install. It took me about over 30 mins to install it, considering I was really tried from not getting enough sleep too. I hAd to do it quick because I only had little time before my baby wakes up & starts crying. Manual tells you step by step on how to install it. This one never leaks water. You just have to make sure you turn the water lever back to off and shake off the excess water after each use. Water will drip off the floor when you don't do these things. All in all this product it good. The spray is very strong. Make sure you spray downward & facing parallel to the poopy cloth diaper or otherwise the poop will get everywhere. My baby's poop still not so solid. He's only 5 months old.. but still, sprayer helps me get most of it off and straight to the toilet. Good buy. Good investment. I am sure I will use it for a very long time until he's done using his diapers.",5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","When new moms ask what products they 'must have' this is always my first recommendation.  We used this almost every night for 6 months with our first baby.  He slept right next to my bed which made it so convenient to nurse him when he woke in the middle of the night.  I slept better because I didn't have to go across the house every time he was hungry.  He also wasn't a fan of his crib; he either didn't like sleeping flat or just liked being a little more snug when sleeping.  Either way this was the solution!  I love that is flattens easily and is lightweight and portable.  I can rock him to sleep when I'm doing the dishes!  The cloth is soft and spot cleans nicely, and also easy to remove and toss in the washer.  Then fits back on just like new.  I highly recommend this for new babies!  And even with using it for as long as we did it still looks brand new for baby #2.  Holds up very well.",5
"Luvable Friends 2-Pack Swaddler Cotton Receiving Blankets, Blue",Really the best baby blankets ever! I love them very much! Other blankets were ignored after them! Good price for nice set. Highly recommend!,5
Stroll-Air MY DUO Stroller- Green),"I could not love this stroller more and I have 5 double strollers (don't judge!) I also have a double BOB revolution, Maclaren Twin Triumph, Babies R' Us side by side Ripple stroller, and Joovy caboose.The Stroll-Air is by far the best!!!  The stroller is really easy to maneuver - drives like a dream.  And this thing comes with everything.  They have really nice foot muffs to snuggle my kids up with, rain covers, insect screen covers, HUGE canopies - they cover so much more than any other stroller - even using a Protect-A-Bub on my Maclaren doesn't even come close to the coverage of the Stroll-Air canopy.  I bought this stroller to use with my newborn and 20 month old a year ago and it is still my favorite stroller of all time.  It folds up really flat, fits through doorways, and the seats pop in and out really easily so I can move my kids to face forward or face me.  I also bought the bassinet which I LOVE and used until my youngest was maybe 10 months old.  It was really cozy and held my purse, etc when we went on walks or to the park.I even took this stroller on a flight and to Disneyland because I love it so much more than my other strollers.  It was easy to travel with.  It comes apart really easily and folds up better than the BOB or my other ones.  I don't know why I don't see more of these strollers around.  I've never actually seen one other than mine.  It's footprint is comparable to the Bugaboo donkey, but it's about 1/2 the price and includes EVERYTHING except for the bassinet.  OK, and no cup holders, but none of my doubles have good cup holders except for the Joovy.",5
Princess Toddler Bed,Very cute bed my daughter loves it! This bed is for a crib sized mattress so if your child is too big for his or  her crib just get a real bed. I also love that its very low to the ground so she can easily climb in and out and even if she falls its not that much of a fall. Also it seems pretty sturdy y daughter likes to bounce on her knees on the bed and the bed is still intact. My daughter is two and sometimes she just likes to lie on her bed and smile.,4
Prince Lionheart Versa Formula Mixer,Love love this product & save more battery than munchkin. Have to buy extra for ON THE GO BAG.,5
Nojo Toddler Satin Pillow,The pillow is very soft and well made. But in my opinion is to small for a toddler crib or bed. It will make a great travel pillow.,4
Boon Bug Pod Suction Cup Bracket,"I was skeptical, after the stick-up bracket didn't work, but this one has held up since I stuck it on the wall... going on a month now!  I don't dare put shampoo up on the shelf, but it's full to the top of toys!  Thank goodness!",5
"Skip Hop Bento Diaper Tote Bag, Black",I have two nieces that are expecting and I wanted to send them something that they might need.  I read the specifications and found this diaper bag to have everything they should need including the little snack box in the separate bottom section.  Both nieces were happy with the gifts!!,5
Sealy Baby Posturepedic Mattress,"it's nice and fits great our baby's crib. i was worried about the size, but it just the right stuff. and it's waterproof!  thanks",5
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar",My youngest daughter loves her pacis.  This was one of her stocking stuffers.  She absolutely loves it and plays with it's tail as she goes to sleep.,5
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","This gate is awesome! I am using it at the bottom of stairs to keep dogs from going up and it is perfect. It shuts on its own, it is easy to open and go through and it keeps the dogs out. It also looks quite nice.",5
Boppy Prenatal Sleep Wedge,"I bought this sleep wedge when I started getting uncomfortable during sleep about halfway through my pregnancy, it definitely helped me get better sleep, took some of the pressure off me holding myself up off my bump during sleep. I would say though if I could change anything about it I would have made it a little longer lengthwise, it barely was long enough for my baby bump area. I haven't used it since I had my son but it was a nightly used item for several months and held up well!",5
Sweet Baby Care Package Gift Box with Teddy Bear - Pink Girls,"I ordered this Sweet Baby Girl Care Package as a gift for a co-worker who is expecting.  The picture looked adorable, and the four 5 star reviews made this seem like an excellent buy.  However, upon arrival, I opened my amazon box to find a rather small and light box.  I opted to return the item, even though there was a charge because I could not imagine that the items pictured, if they are the size pictured could possibly fit into a box that feels as if it weighs one pound.  After reading reviews for other gift baskets by this company, I have discovered that smaller than appearance items are a common complaint.  The complaints also speak of the poor quality of the items (I can not comment on this as I never opened the package, I just include this for informational purposes).Had this item been for myself, I might have kept it to provide a more detailed review.  However, you cannot return the Care Package once it is open, and based on my observations, i did not think it was worth it to give someone a gift that might not serve the purpose that it was purchased for.",1
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,I bought one of these before and liked it so much I bought a second.  One for each room that I use the most,5
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive",What a creative way to go green! I love my mini and large snackbags.The quality is better than i could have imagined. Its great for all your children's snacks and looks so much better than a plastic snack bag inside a small lunch paper bag. I used to hate sending my daughter to school with a paperbag for her mid-day snack(lunch bags were too big).what a way to say money and look fashionable doing it. We both love them and all her friends want one. It would be a good giftbag to give after a birthday party with whatever toys or snacks inside..save our planet!,5
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,"So far it hasn't peeled off.  I'm waiting for it to, but after a month, no sign of it.  It looks cheap, but I'd rather have this over the hard plastic.",4
Boutique Brand New GEENNY Baby Boy Constructor 13PCS CRIB BEDDING SET,Originally I THOUGHT I wanted the Eddie Bauer little builder set but it was getting harder and harder to find the accompanying pieces.  Then I found this set which was MUCH cheaper and equally as cute.... with more accessories included and available!  I am anxious to get it washed and decorate the nursery with it!,5
"Graco RoomFor2 Stand and Ride Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis","Tried other 2 seaters; however, they did not fit in our Mazda3 trunk.This one does and works with other Graco products.Only dislike is the extra seating (standing bar) is relatively limited area for our 2.5 year old. Then again, he prefers to walk most times anyway.Overall solid product and well worth the inexpensive price.",4
"NUK Night Dry Nursing Pad, 24-Count","These pads are great for what I need -- something substantial enough to absorb leaking milk (while my body is regulating milk production).  They're a little bigger than I expected diameter wise, but because of that, they give great coverage.  They're not overly bulky either and you could easily wear them under clothes without them being noticeable.  I don't think I'll continue to use this past the first few months of breastfeeding, as leaks seem to decrease a lot at that point, but for now, they're just what I need.",4
"TWISTER Baby Month Onesie Stickers Baby Shower Gift Photo Shower Stickers, baby shower gift by OnesieStickers","product came quickly and it great condition. stickers were very cute, and were a hit at the baby shower I had purchased these as a gift for. only complaint is the packaging, it appears to be a cd sleeve...but it works, so no biggie.  thank you :)",4
"Sealy Stain Protection Crib Mattress Pad, 52&quot; X 28&quot;",It is an awesome mattress pad! I got three of them and has worked great even after several washes! They haven't shrunk and the material is soft!,5
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado","I purchased this pail liner about a year ago to use with my cloth diapers. I work part time and I cloth diaper when I'm at home and on the weekends. This bag was washed about once every 7 days.  Now the rubbery liner on the inside is starting to crack and peel off. I'm not sure why. The tag says dry on low, which I do, but it also says do not bleach and I know I accidentally bleached it twice. (The diapers were in the laundry and I poured the bleach in, forgetting the liner was in with them.)So, if you buy this, do NOT bleach it. And I'd probably line dry it. I do like the product though, it worked wonderfully for 11 months. So I think I'm going to purchase another one and take better care not to bleach or dry it. I'll see how it goes.",3
Gerber First Essential 6 Pack Latex Nipples,"I have tried to get my breastfed boy to take a bottle for quite a long time. After several attempts with other nipples, such as tommee tippee, and nuk, I have found this is the only one he will actually take! Such a relief! He takes it without any issues or spitting it out (which he did with every other nipple). And he still breastfeeds just fine and takes the bottle when I need him to! Best of both worlds!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","very cool night/toy that shuts off by itself after an hour. still going strong as of 5-4-12, extremely happy with purchase and people we've given them to as gifts love them.",5
"The First Years Compass B540 Booster Seat, Abstract O's","This is a great carseat. It's light, yet solid. It's travel friendly and easily transfers from car to car. Although adjustable, the seat does force the child to ""sit up"" more than a convertible car seat. That fact took my daughter a little time to get used to, especially if she fell asleep in the seat. The design of this seat sits lower on the actual car's back seat which allows my daughter to be more independent in getting into out of the seat compared to her old car seat that sat much higher on the back seat. All I do now is buckle the lap/shoulder belt and off we go! Oh, and who doesn't love having their own cup holder? Genius.",5
4Moms Tub Spout Cover Digitally Displays Water Temperature 4M00101,Bought this for my daughter in law. She said it's the best thing ever! Displays right temperature for baby. Highly recommend!,5
"Kair Air Cushioned Bath Visor, Blue",It's perfect for young kids to have a bath/shower with fun without worrying about the water into the eyes. I strongly recommend to parents.,5
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small",this bag is perfect for keeping soiled cloth diapers contained in my diaper bag. it locks the smell in and doesn't leak. it is also machine-washable and hang-dries pretty quickly in the sun. the small bag can fit about 3-4 inserts (i use g-diapers). i'm planning to get a larger size to use for wet swimsuits and beach gear also. i would highly recommend this bag for anyone using cloth diapers!,5
Manhattan Toy Dress Up Princess,This doll is really adorable but it's certainly not a functioning dress up doll.  The laces in the shoe are so short and thick that I could barely tie them myself.  A 3 year old would definitely not be able to.  And the zipper is really stiff and impossible to open.  The eye patch falls down so that the strap covers it's left eye as well as the right and the parrot leans backwards the whole time so you have to keep propping it up.  But the face of the doll is adorable.,3
"BOB Handlebar Console, Duallie",Fits perfectly and nice to have! Great for 2 cup holders and a place for keys for the Double BOB.,5
Petunia Pickle Bottom **NEW Spring 13** City Carryall-Breakfast in Berkshire,"This is the best bag I've ever owned.  It is very durable, water resistant, classy and functional.  The material of the bag is very light, which is a big deal when you are carrying around all your baby stuff, your child and for me, the weight of my next pregnancy.  It's also a great price for a petunia picklebottom bag.",5
"Joovy Caboose Ultralight Stroller, Blueberry","Overall great stroller. Not comfortable for the kid in the back on long trips, so I wouldn't advise using this at Disneyland unless your kid rarely sits. Perfect for quick trips around town. Folds up easy, but its long. A little challenging to get to the underbasket since you have to squeeze past the little seat in back. Not a huge deal, but good to know. I'm using this with the car seat adapter (which is easy to place with a strap to secure) in front so I might have to come back another time to review how it works once my son can sit up front.",4
"Sassy Baby Food Nurser, Colors May Vary","I wasn't a huge fan of how these were made.  I saw SO many good reviews and thought I'd give em a try since you can't get them in stores anymore.  They leaked, and I had to help push the food towards the nipple.  The vacuum didn't seal correctly on one of them and there were huge air bubbles without any food after just a full pulls from my little one.  The other food nurser's top lid didn't last very long.  I took it apart to clean it and after it dried and I put it back together, it never fit correctly again.  Luckily they were inexpensive, because I really only used each one about two or three times then gave up and pitched them.",2
"Baby Fanatic Pacifier Clip, Ohio State","Good quality, stays secure, goes great with OSU pacifiers, cute. Makes a great addition to an OSU themed shower gift.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"Nice pump, will recommend to all moms. However it makes a funny sound when I pump and it is loud - I wish it was more quiet.",4
Green Sprouts Stacking Cup Set (Pack of 2),"I bought the two pack so I could use one for regular stacking and the other for bath toys. Yes I'm aware I could have just bought one and dried them out after every use. But lets face it, she's over a year old, incredibly active and the time I have available to the most trivial household chore is now VERY limited. Out of all her other toys that were much more expensive, have buttons, lights, longs, she loves playing with these cups the most. Don't know why, but I'm not going to complain that her taste in toys is cheap and simple. Makes my job easier and better on the budget.The second reason, bath time. She would freak out every time I tried to rinse the shampoo out of her hair or soap off her face. Understandable, but it make bath time very difficult, so much so that she was starting to fight baths because she could sense the impending doom that was getting her head and face cleaned. So the stacking cups being her favorite toy along with them having small holes in the bottom let her have more fun in the water and the small holes in the bottom of the stacking cups let me gently shower off her head and face without a tantrum. It's a much better solution than just filling a cup and dumping it on her head.",5
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"There are actually far more functions on this product than I am sure we will ever use. But that just adds to it's versatility I suppose. I purchased this product because it doesn't automatically shut off after a certain time period. The sound options are great, and you have a decent range of volume options. We use this in my 2 year old daughter's room every night and she has slept soundly ever since!",5
Safety 1st Complete Coverage Deluxe RollerShade 2-Pack,"This roller shade is affordable and of good quality, but it would be more effective in our Saab station wagon if it were wider.  The sun always seems to find its way through the remaining gaps, right into my daughter's eyes, thus ""complete coverage"" is a bit misleading.",4
Grab Apple Assortment Toy,This is without a doubt my 7 mo daughter's favorite toy.  She can easily hold it and chew on the crinkly fabric leaves.  I was disappointed to get it in red however; I thought it was going to be pink.  But it's still a wonderfully age-appropriate fun toy for her.,5
"babyletto Hudson 3 in 1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Espresso/White","We bought this crib for a second home, and since we had already bought a pricy crib and were only using this one infrequently/temporarily, I couldn't justify spending money on the Oeuf Sparrow crib, which is really what I wanted.I read the reviews and managed my expectations, so was pleasantly surprised when the Babyletto crib arrived! It went together easily, it's sturdy (we are using it for our 2 year old) and the conversion kit came with it, which was another money-saver. The paint/wood stain are well-done and I don't see any signs of wear/peeling after three months of use. I was expecting a crib that looks cheap, but this one doesn't.The only minor issue is that the corners along the bottom base of the bed are not as rounded as the tops, so we put corner protectors on them in case our daughter is rolling on the floor near it (which she does). Aside from that, a great product that delivers good style at a reasonable price!",5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink","We needed a new thermos for back to school - this one works well, keeps food warm, and is easy for little hands to open.",5
BONAMART &reg; three-D Kids Baby Girl Boy Toddler Bibs Cute Cartoon Strawberry Soft Saliva Towel,"I bought this to coordinate with a strawberry thing I had going on - great for drool, not so great for spit up or eating as there is a gap from the length of the straps so you end up having to wash the top your child has on anyway! I tie it near the snap and sometimes that helps if you feed your baby with it!",3
"Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 2.8 Inch",This video baby monitor is great. I replaced my 6 year old monitor and the difference is night/day. The video and sound quality is better than I expected. The battery lasts a long time.,5
The Piggyback Rider Standing Child Carrier - NOMIS Basic Model,"I think this is a great idea, but it was very uncomfortable for both me and my child. However if you are a taller person carrying a shorter child I think it could work. My son was too tall and he had to slouch over to hold on to the handles. I tried adjusting the bar that he stands on to be lower, but then that made it way too uncomfortable for me to carry him because the bar was bouncing against my legs.",3
green sprouts Organic Velour Finger Puppet 3pc Set-Farm Girls,I searched high and low for safe finger puppets and I'm so happy I found these. I purchased this adorable set for my granddaughter when she was 10 months. They are soft and safe for chewing unlike other finger puppets that may have small parts. She became fond of them holding one in each hand while she crawled around pausing once in a while and staring at their little faces. They are washed everyday and still holding up. She is 13 months now and these puppets are still a favorite and grandma is ready to get her next set. I can't wait to see her face!,5
Medela 9 Volt Vehicle Lighter Adaptor,"This is great for pumping in the car and works well.  However, the cord does get curled up, and I think there had been a recall at one point on these due to kinking of the cord...",4
"NuRoo Pocket Skin to Skin (M/L, Black)",This item is a great product especially if you have a preemie. My baby was born 9 weeks early and needed the skin to skin contact. When he finally came home from the hospital he was on oxygen. It's hard enough to carry a small baby around but even harder when he's attached to a 25 foot cord.  The Nuroo made it possible to do everyday chores. He also sleeps so much better on my chest.The sizing is pretty accurate - I was between size 10 and 12 before pregnancy and I received an extra large. It fits perfectly and baby fits snugly.I would recommend this product for anyone with a fussy baby or a small baby. I couldn't imagine being comfortable with a larger baby.,5
Evenflo Expansion Swing Gate,"This gate served it's purpose while it lasted, so I can not bring myself to rate it a 1.  However there are a few things one should know before purchasing it.  First, it is difficult to open and close.  The latch does pinch and is often a pain to line up.  We found it much easier to just step over the thing.  Second, on the opening side there is one pinchable latch at the top and the bottom rests in a little hook of which my son was able to manipulate with little problem to push up just enough to pop the bottom out and crawl through it.  Third and most importantly, it is a nightmare for climbing toddlers.  The criss-cross design allows for easy climbing and just last week my 19 month old scaled it only to land head first on the other side.  So that is definitely something parents will want to consider before purchasing this baby gate.  For this reason alone I would dissuade parents from buying this particular design.",2
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Crib 'N Go Projector Soother,"My little one started to enjoy this at around 5 months old. Out of nowhere we were having to get up at 5:30 for a feeding and wide awake, no matter bedtime....so I would feed, put this on and go back to bed. I only have had to get up once or twice to push it again. That's the only complaint, that you can't make it go as long as you want.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Bouncer,"My little one loves this bouncer so much! He is actually in in right now ;o)It is so much fun for him! I notice that when he was a wee baby he loved to stare at the lit/moving waterfall. As he grew he aimed to reach the hanging monkey and parrot and now at 7 months he grabs them. Oh and the moving animals near the waterfall are too cute!The music is fun but be warned, it will be embedded in your head!! I find myself humming the happy little tunes while cleaning the house or waiting n line at the grocery store.A negative is that is eats batteries! But then again, most toys like this do.To round this up, I am VERY happy with this bouncer and will, without a doubt, use it again for child #2 :o)",5
"HALO SleepSack Comfort Mesh Early Walker Wearable Blanket, Blue Dog, Large","I'm not sure the sizing is correct - is bigger than what I expected.  My daughter is 20 mos old and about 32 1/2"""" tall - the XL should have been perfect but instead it's way too long. The middle part at the bottom drags on the floor.  I might get one size smaller until she can grow into this one. Overall I love this product though and would highly recommend.",4
"P'kolino Children's Desk, Orange","The wood looks nice, it is aesthetically pleasing, & if you have a girl, it's a good choice though a bit pricey at $69. If you have a rough & tumble boy first, I don't think this desk will last through to the next child except in a shambles.",3
Philips Avent Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,The Advent baby monitor has been a blessing to this household with a new grandparent. The camera actually turns on when the baby cries. The night vision is so good and the audio as well. We have a small home and the sound alert us at night even if when we cannot see the baby's crib well. The lullaby feature is great and can be set to a continuous loop. We can actually watch the baby fall asleep to the lullaby. Pricey but well worth the cost.,5
"Skip Hop Zoo Straw Bottle, Ladybug, 12 Ounce",I'm returned customer on this. I think they have improved the printing on the bottle. It's harder to get scratched.,5
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black",Loved it from the first use. Very helpful and high quality organizer. Now my stroller is well organized and I feel grat about purchased product.,5
"Babykicks 3G Pocket Diaper, Azure/White Snaps","I have to admit...I was giddy with excitement when the package came in the mail!  My first impressions where that it is really soft, really trim and the fleece leg gussets are genius.  So I prepped it and quickly got it on my 7 month old girl and was happy with the ease of putting it on and the way it fit my baby girl.  The snap rise is easy to adjust, the side snaps are sturdy and seem to hold well.  I love the trim design of the front panel and the pocket is in the front!  That's right, it's in the front of the diaper.  Somehow I missed this when reading about it. I can imagine that this is going to be a huge blessing when it comes time to clean up a poopy diaper!  The insert seems to be very absorbent, when I changed her it was very wet but her skin was dry and there was no leaking.I should mention that I was little confused about the extra snaps on the waist panel.  The diaper does not come with any detailed instruction, as most don't, so I wasn't sure if there was some fancy way I needed to be snapping it, lol.  After looking around the Babykicks website I found an online class they held on the 3G which explained that those extra snaps are part of their newborn sizing option. This 3G diaper can get teeny tiny for the littlest of bums! Another brilliant feature in this diaper!I would recommend this diaper!",5
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella",This car seat arrived on time and was really nice when I took it out the box. I haven't regretted my decision since purchasing it.,4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","My daughter receives services from our local infant child development program and they brought this tub over for us to try as my daughter is 12 1/2 months old (19lbs and 29"""" long) and still can not sit up related to trauma at birth. Now that we are moving to a different town we will have to return the tub so I purchased our own. This tub allows her to be relaxed while fully supported and have FUN during bath time!!! I love that she is able to have a place big enough for her to be reclined in and yet a whole different side when she finally (and hopefully) can sit up! This tub truly is a wonderful product and inexpensive ESPECIALLY for how long you will be able to use it. I would recommend it to anyone!!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Sophie is great. I had my doubts about spending this much money for a &#34;chew toy&#34; but it was well worth it. We've had it for almost 2 years now and it still looks great and my 2 year old son still plays with it.,5
Jolly Jumper Stroller Caddy - Stroller Handlebar Organizer,"I have an UPPA VISTA, the handle bars are at a 45 degree angle with no bend in them. The Jolly Jumper fits on the handle bars but the bag also sits at a 45 degree angle. Basically, this would work if I always carried around a drink with a cap on it but never an open container. If you have a stroller that will hold the bag level it will probably work better for you.Aside from the angle of the handle bars, I wasn't thrilled with it in general. The cup holders are not large enough to fit larger coffee cups or even larger water bottles. There is nothing that really gives the caddy any structure so the bottom part swings while the top stays rigid, making things bounce around. I tried this caddy head to head with the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy (which is cheaper) and found that caddy to be better material, better structure and the cup holders stretch to hold larger cups.",2
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Galaxy Grey","I absolutely love this carrier.  So does my baby boy which is what is most important.  I received the Baby Born carrier as a gift and have that product to compare the ERGObaby against.  The ERGObaby is so much more comfortable for moms than the Baby Born.  The Baby Born offers very little back support.  I would have given this product five stars if the baby were able to be positioned face forward (away from mom/dad) so that baby can see more.  So far my seven month old is not bothered by this &#34;problem&#34;  and pokes his little head out looking in every direction.  The Baby Born does allow the baby to face forward but in my mind this does not negate the comfort issue.  The ERGObaby does allow you to side carry, back carry and front carry your baby which is a nice feature.",4
niceEshop Baby Child Kids Safety Cabinet Door Fridge Drawer Locks (Pack of 2),"My 13 month baby got them off as soon as I put them on, so I wouldn't never buy these or recommend them to anyone.",1
"Lamaze Cloth Book, Panda's Pals",My 11 month old daughter loves lift the flap books but would tear off the flaps.  This book was the perfect solution!  Colorful and fun for my little girl.,5
Prince Lionheart Multi-Purpose Toy Hammock,I have the Prince Lionheart Jumbo toy hammock in my son's room and love it! My daughter needed one for her animals too. Based on this product picture I thought this one would be big too. Imagine my surprise when I saw how tiny it is. I'll be ordering the jumbo version. Amazon was at least nice enough to let me keep this one and are going to issue me a refund anyway. But they really need to change the picture b/c it's a total misrepresentation of the actual size. Had no idea this was actually meant for bath toys. (Kinda wondered why it came with suction cups when the other one hadn't.),1
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,Great product the baby smiled right away when she saw it. She started to chew on it right away and love the squeak noise it makes.,5
"Pikibu I-See-You Car Family Mirror, Black",I agree with the other reviews I read.  I love this.  It is solid and I don't have to worry about it flying off and hurting someone.,5
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Burpy Bib, Butterfly Patch","Baby girl looks so pretty in this bib! It is soft and thick and gives excellent coverage. regular bibs just kind of sit there and flip up and are so annoying, The only downside with this is when she is fidgety and puts her arms up, this covers her face. And, you don't want to put them down in a crib with this on (OBVIOUSLY). My husband did just that and I walked in to find baby asleep with this over her face. Sigh. But, it's really great and I will probably purchase a few more.",4
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink",When i heard about this balnket i laughed !!! how will this calm my baby down?? but i watched some videos saw it helped other mother  and i ordered it!!! i used it for the first time after i fed my baby and i changed her pamper so i knew she was comfortable and had no reason realy to cry and wrapped her up and the rest is history!!! i have a changed baby (this item can only be used to calm babies that are fed changed and burped not just to calm a hungry uncomfortable baby!!!!),4
KidCo Spring Action Cabinet Lock 4-pack,Seriously great. Husband bought another brand and hated them. These were slow to install on our (very hard) cabinets but they are working out great.,5
Bearington Baby Posh Dots Series:Large Cozy Chenille Crib Blanket (Blue),"This is the second Chenille Bearington Bear Blanket I have purchased.  The first blanket I purchased for my newborn son.  He is 17 months now and the blanket is still in great shape.  This is a quality blanket, pretty and soft.  I purchased this second blanket as a gift.",5

"Dream On Me Full Size Play Yard, Gray","This play yard is perfect!  If you read the instructions, which are clearly printed on the inside of the play yard, it's very easy to set up and take down.  It's sturdy, and stores away quickly and easily.  I love it, and my grandson is comfortable in it!  I made my own crib sheet for it, so I have no idea what sheets would fit it.  I would definitely recommend this product!",5
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump - Carry All,"I have a Medela pump-in-style, an older model. I was hired for a full time job in September when my infant was 4 months old. I planned to pump at work so I bought the Ameda pump to keep at work, but I planned to use the Medela at home. My research showed that many liked the pump and it was cheaper than the Medela.  Both are comparable on clean-up. I find the Ameda very quiet, the Medela is loud but I have an office and can close my door. The Medela is rather bulky and not as portable as the Ameda. Finally, the Medela is more efficient than the Ameda. After using the Ameda pump at work for a while I wanted to know how it compared to the Medela so I switched them out and brought the Medela to work and used the Ameda at home. I concluded that in 15 minutes at work I can pump maybe 4 ounces with the Ameda versus at least 6-8 ounces using the Medela. Also, I've noticed that the Ameda pumps speed dial is a joke, there's nearly no difference as you increase the speed. The suction dial is better at controlling suction, but is defintely less powerful than the Medela. That's my experience. I recommend the Medela over the Ameda and now wish I would have put my $200 dollars toward another Medela model instead of purchasing the Ameda.",2
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",I started out with the dr. Browns bottles but they leaked so much they were such a hassle.  These leak once in a great while and are easy to clean.,4
Safety 1st Secure Close Handle Lock,I love these because the kids can not open them but boy do they try ! So eventually they wear down and break,5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Twin Electric Breast Pump,The philips avent breastpump is very effective in pumping milk..but it is very big and to prepare the pump daily 7 times is very time taking.,3

Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,This severely hampered all wifi to my computer. To the point I had to disconnect and reconnect the wifi every 1-2 minutes.I was going nuts for weeks because I thought it was my brand new computer or the adapter causing the problems.Besides that this Monitor is really amazing. It has been a huge help being able to watch our child.,4
"Leachco Podster Sling-Style Infant Seat Lounger, Sage Pin Dot","Our daughter was born two weeks ago and she LIVES in this lounger! She was a little on the small size (6lbs 9oz) and this is perfect for supporting her tiny body. It's very womb-like and she'll snuggle in and sleep for hours at a time. This goes everywhere we do these days. In fact, I'm considering ordering another so we have one on both floors of our house. Can't recommend this product enough!",5
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Olivia the Owl","I received this as a gift and my baby girl Loves Olivia Owl! She is now 3 months old but has been batting and grabbing it since 2 months. She goes crazy over this thing! It is sensitive enough that at the slightest push it makes a nice rattle noise,which keeps her interested. She talks to it and grabs all the parts now! Its great for them to learn cause and effect relationships. I have it hanging on one of those baby mat/gym things along with the mirror that came with the gym. I don't reallly put too much else on there so she does not get too over stimulated.",5
"aden + anais Muslin Stroller Blanket, Jungle Jive",This blanket is the perfect weight for spring!  I have two of these and use them everyday and every night.  They are super soft.  By far my favorite blanket.,5
"Lassig Shoulder Diaper Bag, Glam Choco","I have bought so many diaper bags with all my kids. I would get bored with them,they would become ripped,damaged in some way.I won this same exact bag from the company 2 years ago and it still looks PERFECT.So many pockets,came with a bottle holder,diaper changing pad and a small little zipper bag.I would recommend this bag to anyone who is looking for a very long lasting,stylish beautiful diaper bag.",5
Disney Classic Pooh Ivory Newborn Lovey Security Blanket,"I found this in one random store before my son was born, I bought two in the beginning and 5 month later, I had to buy 5 more to change daily. I introduced quite a few blankets to him since he was born, he only chose this one. He always sleeps with it and wakes up with it even till today.  Since it's a perfect small size and light for babies to grab and makes him feel secure.  Even when he feels cranky, he knows where they are (in his drawer), so approaches to the drawer, open it and look for it.",5
"Starting Small Monkey Novelty Hamper in Brown,  18 x 11 x 24",Works great and its adorable! Great product; great price!,5
"Angel Dear Chenille Blanket, White",My baby can't get enough of her giraffe lovey.  She loves playing with the little corners of the doll with her fingers.  Small enough t bring with us anywhere we go.  It's so cute also.,5
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","Everything about this purchase was EXCELLENT. Product as described, delivery on time, and very very happy with this stroller. Lightweight , strong and very portable.. Will purchase again",5
Playtex Drop-Ins Original BPA Free Nurser 8 oz  - 1 Pack - Colors Vary,"the item is great but I'm disspointed cause I've ordered the original bottle and got the premium one, which I don't like cause its plastic is more fragile.",4
"green sprouts Infant Water Bottle Cap Adapter, Green","I am still waiting for the product to arrive (I made an order on Amazon months ago). However, I have gotten one previously as a part of a Green Sprouts set and found it to be VERY useful. You can connect it to any water bottle and feed the baby. So I don't always have to bring a separate sippy cup. It's also very small, so very portable and easy to take on trips.",5
"Spasilk 10 pack Soft Terry Washcloth, Blue","Small, not very absorbancy, and is not very soft, especially after multiple washes. I would not recommend this at all.",2
Dr. Brown's Gia Nursing Pillow,"A pillow helps keep the baby off your incision site during feedings, reducing pain. I had a boppy for my first baby and never felt it fit me right. Love the Gia as it is shaped in a way that doesn't require a petite frame. It's soft and easy to use. Take it with you to the hospital; the lactation consultant can give you tips on how to use it. My husband uses it for bottle feedings too.",5
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump - Carry All,"I use this pump twice a day, 5 days a week at work, plus occasionally once on the weekend.  I've been using the pump for 2 months.  It definitely meets my baby's needs; by pumping on both sides at the same time, I can pump 4-8 oz. in about 10 minutes. I bring home about 10-14 oz. per day, and that is approximately what my daughter eats while I'm gone.  I have had no mechanical problems with the pump, and I appreciate that the cycle speed and suction levels are adjustable.  It's easy to mimic how my baby eats and therefore it's easy to stimulate the letdown of the milk.Why a 4-star rating and not a 5-star?  Because it really, truly is loud.  It makes a grinding noise AND a beeping noise with every single cycle.  I have an office with a heavy wooden door, but my coworkers have let me know that they can hear the pump through the door!  Considering that this is a $200 item, I think that the manufacturer should try to make it quieter.  On the other hand, it is still quite a bit cheaper (and lighter to carry) than a comparable Medela pump.",4
"phil&amp;teds Traveller Crib, Black","We used this for one of our twin girls -- the other used a peapod traveller. It is high quality, and we assembled, dismantled and reassembled it before travelling so we were comfortable with the steps. The first time took forever because the pictures aren't great, but you can look up youtube videos to see how it's done (we didn't, but they're there!).We put it in our daughter's room and had her sleep in it before we traveled so it would be a comfortable place while in a foreign land. It worked perfectly! We had well rested, happy toddlers!The size was great as was the weight for travelling. Well worth the price and sacrifice to bring it along!I never bought a pack'nplay and thank goodness, my money is much better spent here!",5
"Pavlov'z Toyz Light and Sound Vanity Table Play Set, Pink,Purple,White",I bought this vanity thinking it was more sturdy than what it is. Very easy to put together but very cheap for the money I spent. I like the fact that the stool is very low to the ground. The drawer in the vanity is very hard to open and close and when she pulls it out the whole thing comes out she cannot put it back in.,3
"Munchkin Diaper Duty Organizer, Colors May Vary",Nice little organizer for my sons nursery.,5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","Sticks amazingly well and cushions nicely. The straight pieces can easily be made into corner pieces, since four corners go quickly.",5
Summer Infant Bassinet Pad,Fits perfect and not too bulky. Mattress is one inch thick and the right width and length. Carter's velour bassinet sheets fit great.,5
"Munchkin Deluxe Bottle Brush, Colors May Vary","I bought several of these brushes because we go through them left and right. Afer 10 months of using them...I  have decided that I do not like them...at all. The nipple brush uses a metal wire...which rusts after about a month or so. The lengh of the brush is just a little too short. To wash an 8oz bottle is a little difficult because once the brush is fully in, there is only about 1-1 1/2 inches of the handle to hold on to in order to clean the bottle. Even with having smaller hands...this makes it hard to twist and clean. If you put the nipple brush back in and try to twist it...it doesn't work because the nipple brush doesn't ""lock"".",2
"phil&amp;teds Lobster Highchair, Red","Love it, these things are perfect for a toddler, and our baby fits in there well now too.  Perfect for resteraunts.",5
Clevamama Clevabath Mat and Kneeler,I have had this mat for about a year and I really loved it for my 16-month old twins. It sticks just fine in our tub so it must either be hit or miss or have to do with the material the tub is made out of it. I am buying a replacement because the one I have is getting shabby after so much use (I left it in the tub 24x7 instead of only putting it in for my twins baths.i don't use the kneeler. It is too small but I didn't purchase this for that reason.,4
"Mumi&amp;Bubi Solids Starter Kit, 42 x 1oz Cubes In Two Compact Baby Food Freezer Storage Trays, Plus Free e-Recipes","These arent that great. I would stick to the individual storage containers. If you have a little too much in any of the trays it doesn't close properly. Ive also noticed that this gets freezer burn easily. If you are going to be using this for one specific food, its ok.",2
"Safety 1st Table Edge Protector, Medium","My standard rectangular coffee table is 150"""" (which totally meets the specifications for this product per the description) and it was falling off the sides.  Immediately returned it.",1
"Safety 1 Clic Infant Car Seat Carrier, Black","It's a great concept, BUT the wheels on this carrier are so cheap.  Really cheap plastic.  We rubbed against the curb on the first day of use and the wheels got ""rubbed off.""  It doesn't steer well ever since.  Poor construction.",1
Bright Starts Lots of Links- Solid Colors,The links are a bit flimsy. Not the quality I expected. The links are easily pulled apart by my 7 month old.,2
Mommy's Helper Safe-er-Grip Foot Rest,"I am pregnant for the first time and shower in a shower stall. I have nothing to prop my foot on when I shave. The bigger the belly, the harder it was for me to shave my legs. This has been a life saver. It holds to the wall very well-it fell off once, but I was also putting too much weight on it. I highly recommend this product.",5
MG Baby Cloth Diaper with 2 Four Layer Bamboo Inserts,I bought several of these diapers to try them out because they are so cute.  They work great too.  Love the bamboo liner.  Everything stays where it needs to.,5
"Bright Starts Comfort &amp; Harmony Cozy Cart Cover, Calypso Blue","This is wonderful for covering not-so-clean restaurant highchairs and cushioning shopping cart seats.  The colors are bright and Baby loves to chew on it.  There are 3 cloth hooks on the front for attaching toys.  Wonderful idea!  My son can have a few toys to play with and be entertained all through dinner.  It rolls up for storage in the car - not great, but smaller.",5
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","I love this carrier!! I have several slings that I use for shopping, walks, etc, and have previously used for around the house.  However, as my son gets bigger (he's 8 months old now) he wants to move around more, throw himself backward, suddenly shift his weight to reach for something, etc, and I get nervous having him in the sling unless I have a hand available to catch him if necessary. With this carrier, he is so much more stable and secure, I can tote him around anywhere with me and don't have to worry about him squirming his way out or suddenly shifting different directions while I'm leaning over doing something.  Also, my sitters (I don't use daycare, I have 2 babysitters who take turns watching him while I'm at work) use this item (they both have their own) and they both love it as well.  He frequently falls asleep while they are doing housework or tending their kids while he rides along on the sitter's back.  Don't get me wrong - I love my slings and couldn't survive without them, but this is definitely on my list of must-have baby tools/items.",5
2 in 1 Professional Clinical RY230 Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead and Surface,Love it!  easy to use.  its non contact that my patients adore.  i dont to clean it after each use.  although i use it on one patient of mine...,5
Jolly Jumper Weathershield for Infant Car Seat,"I have a hard time figuring if it's gonna fit my Graco Snugride 32, but I took a chance and I'm happy that I did it. The plastic color is a tad on a brown side instead of clear like the picture, I don't know if it's because I have an older stock or what. Does the job though.",5
Baby K'tan Baby Carrier - SAGE GREEN (Extra Small - Fits women's dress size: 0 - 4) *COMBO* with Rockin' Green Soap and Tooth Tissues!,I purchased this carrier and it's perfect.  So easy to use and doubles as cute scarf around your neck when the baby is not in it.  The sage green is perfectly true to color as shown.  Could not be happier.  I have other wraps that seem like they are about 20 feet long and take forever to put on.  Do yourself a favor and &#34;YOU TUBE&#34; this baby K'tan vs other carriers and it is pretty amazing how fast you can be on the go with your little one!,5
Boutique Brand New GEENNY Boy Sailor 13PCS Baby Nursery CRIB BEDDING SET,I was skeptical about purchsing a product without seeing it in person but fell in love with the pictures of this set online.  I could not believe how quickly it arrived (2 days) & how absolutely adorable it was in person!  You get so many pieces for such a great price.  I would highly recommend this product to others.  Our little one will arrive in 9 weeks & he is sure to love his bedding set as much as his Mommy & Daddy!,5
"Carter's Green Elephant Musical Mobile, Green/Choc","this is a really cute mobile and the music is nice, but the elephants often get stuck on the rod and then the mobile doesn't turn.",3
phil&amp;teds Sport Sun/Insect Mesh Cover - Single,This is a good idea in theory.. in reality it is a little cumbersome. It is difficult to whip on and off.. and let's face it. With a small baby you need to be able to get to them! Too exopensive for a sub par product. I actually don't think there are many accesories that work well with this stroller.. I just sold mine.,2
Trend Lab Max Dot Blooming Bouquet Hooded Towel,"This towel is perfect for babies; dries off baby quickly while keeping them warm. No, it's not the ultra lux fluffy towel you would want for adults. It is a soft medium-weight terry towel that's large for wrapping up babies/infants after bath and washes well again and again.",5
"Graco RoomFor2 Stand and Ride Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis","I wouldn't recommend this stroller if you're looking to take it to a fair or long strolls in the sun.  The sun shade doesn't even protect the entire child in the front seat (it protects either the head or the legs), let alone my older child in the jump seat.  Also, the storage in the bottom is very small and almost impossible to get items in and out of it.  You have to pull the elastic on the side and squeeze items in.Otherwise, it's very lightweight and easy to use.",2
SheetWorld Fitted Pack N Play (Graco) Sheet - White Quilted - Made In USA,Fit perfect and were just what I was looking for.  Also arrived in time for me to use during the hilidays,4
Summer Infant Bentwood High Chair,"This chair has held up great with a 17 month old.  It looks great.  However, the fixed tray is becoming more cumbersome as my daughter grows...it's a tight fit to get her legs in and out.  Also, the cushion is wimpy and doesn't stay in place.  I had to make my own set of cushions.  You can't go without as it is slippery and uncomfortable.",3
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda Veloce Stroller, Mint Java","This is a great buy, I bought TWo for my 21 mo. old twins. It's a nice fabric, very soft, has a great sunshade canopy, cupholder, folds easy & has a lick, has swivel wheels & basket & lastly  several positions. We bought it so we can split up or keep the twins togetehr & its great for a travel stoller & shopping. buy it!",5
Nuby 2 Pack Replacement Silicone Spouts,"Same as what comes with the sippy cup. These are not available to buy at stores without purchasing the cup too.  The cost for two replacement nipples is more than replacing entire cup with new nipple,  but we did not want more cups. We needed only the nipples.",5
"Joovy Caboose Too Ultralight Stroller, Black","Beyond words how much I love this stroller! Its light weight, I love all the attachments that have come with it. My son enjoys sitting and standing on it, it will be a joy to use it with our new addition here soon. I've already tested it with his cousin in the carseat and it's perfect.",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"Have you ever noticed that all first time parents have this, but seldom do you see it used with the second or third child?  It is for a good reason, it is a pain!  I found it very cumbersome to get the diaper in the container and make sure it was closed back up, while I had a crying, squirming baby in my arms.  The the worst part is when you have to open up the bottom, and take out the sausage like package of petrified diapers.  They still end up stinking up the baby's room!  I have found it is much cheaper, and more sanitary to simply put a diaper pail (or wastebasket with lid) right outside of my sliding glass door.  That way I can throw the diapers out, with no nasty smell in the house.  And then just take that bag out to the trash along with my kitchen trash.  No more carrying poopy diaper links out to the garbage.",1
Sugar Plum by Cocalo Removable Wall Decals,These match my daughter's Sugar Plum bedding perfectly!  They stick great and look adorable.  They cover a lot of wall space.,5
"Disney Printed Boa Blanket with Rattle, Winnie the Pooh","Very soft fleece blanket, generous size, colors are brilliant and exactly as shown on website.  Also,  the Piglet rattle is adorable.",5
Munchkin Five Sea Squirts,"With only one teeny tiny little hole, all of them eventually developed mildew inside.  I've done everything I could think of to keep it from happening or clean them out to no success.  She got 6 months use out of them, so probably worth the price I guess.  They're now in the trash.",3
EOZY Baby Crochet Yellow Snail Beanie Cap Hats Photography Costume,"This is really cute, but coloring is different in person than what it looks like. Plus it is about impossible to get it to stay on my baby!",3
Galt Playnest - Jungle,"This is a fun toy for most kids, my 5 month old will stay in it for about 10-15 min before he tires of it. I purchased it at half price on Amazon and am happy, but I would not end up paying full price. It's not that amazing.",4
"Safety 1st Boost Air Protect Booster Car Seat, Dixie",This booster seat has been good. My only dislike comes with many booster seats I'm sure.. When my daughter fell asleep her head falls down and looks very uncomfortable. We did find if we lean the seat back a little (we have middle bucket seats) her head does not fall forward when she falls asleep. This seat is very easy to use and I would recommend it to others. I really also like the pattern and there is lots of cushion in the seat!,4
Evenflo Exersaucer Mega Circus,"I read someone elses review that says ""couldn't have taken a shower without it"", all I have to say to that is, hallelujah! Everyday for months I put this thing in the bathroom in front of our wall mirror, my son loved it. Between playing with all the toys and smiling/talking to himslef in the mirror, I could once again take a shower that lastest more than 2 minute, and even put on some make-up and brush my hair!And just like the other mom said, put them in this with the Baby Einstein on and you've got yourself one life saving baby cocktail! My son loves it and I couldn't get very much done without it! Although now that he's 8 months and very mobile, he doesn't like it so much anymore, he'd rather be free to chase the dogs and throw the dvd's all over the house. =)",5
"Thirsties Duo Wrap Snap, Ocean Blue, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I'm on my second cloth diapered child, and this time around found I really like prefolds and covers (I used mostly Bumgenius one-size on the first child). I only had small covers, so once she outgrew them I thought I'd grab a couple of larger ones - I was really pleased to find these Thirsties ones that are useful over a larger size range. I love the leg gussets and the back elastic - the only leaks I've had in these came when she managed to get a large volume of poop right in the leg seam, and then it was a minor leak and not a 'blowout.' The sizing is really accurate - she's 17.37 lbs right now and these fit just right if I snap one side on the last snap and the other side one snap in, so it looks like they're going to fit right up to 18 lbs. I'll be ordering a couple more in the larger size soon, and I love that that's all I'll need (rather than having to buy new ones every few months as she grows).",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Sea Turtle","So adorable. She will love it. This is a Christmas present, so I will let you knowafter she opens it. But anyway, I love it.",5
"Combi Cocorro Lightweight Convertible Car Seat, Keylime","Love this car seat because it is compact, light, and great to take along on airplane & trips. Easy to operate & transfer into different cars. Would buy again. Only wish it had a cup holder.",5
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black",The sun shades didn't really stick to my windows.  It did at first but it seems like once they get wet or if you have to clean them they don't have the same &#34;ez-cling&#34; feature.,2
"Summer Infant Gentle Vibrations Toothbrush, Teal/White","My toddler hated to brush his teeth before I purchased this electric toothbrush. Now, he loves to brush away! Definitely worth the money.",5
Chicco Splashing Sea Horse and Sea Friends Bath Toy,Absolutely adorable bath toy! I actually use it for our pool with a child's bait net with handle. Very colorful and durable. I would highly recommend it.,5
"The First Years Compass B540 Booster Seat, Abstract O's","Love this product. I was surprised to see that the seat is actually better looking than the picture. I feel that the seat is safe, sturdy and very comfortable. My child loves it too.The combination of colors are nice. Thinking about getting another one for Grandma's car. I looked everywhere in specialty stores, walmart, target but this seat is really a great seat and for the price is really a great deal.",5
"babyletto Modo 3 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Espresso","Received this as a gift from my father for the birth of my first child. The crib is fabulous with all the height settings and it looks really nice. The only issue We've had with this is that the paint wears off - only wearing off in the areas where there is the heaviest use so it's not as if it's wearing off all over. Also, it is an environmentally friendly/Non-Toxic paint so I'm assuming that plays into it a little bit.  Regardless, I'll be using this through my son's toddler years and maybe for a 2nd child. Overall it's a great crib and when the day comes to turn it into a toddler bed I'm sure it will be just as great :-)",4
lillebaby COMPLETE Baby Carrier Original (Warm Orange/Cream),"I think there is just 1 review that is not fake.  All reviews are from non purchasers and some give different reviews on just different versions of the same item.  Guess they bought all of the carriers.  I just bought one and will update after I find out if it is as good as the ergo brand since my wife bought that oneedit.  I raised my review from 1 star to 4 stars.  My wife likes the ergo better, I like this product better.  Material is heavier on the ergo and the ergo is more attractive and has more padded straps.  I much more prefer the lille for being able to narrow the lower of the carrier making it easier for a smaller baby to drop their legs out.  I don't like for my 12 lbs baby sitting on his legs in the ergo.  Also we just dropped the infant insert on the ergo which lost all the support of the head which the lille still gives.  lumbar support pad I worthless in my opinion.  I would rate it 5 out of 5 stars if it used a similar material and strap padding to the ergo as well as give it a pocket.",4
"Gunamuna Gunapod Wearable Baby Sleepsack, Chocolate, Medium","I don't know if my son is just extra strong, but he rips these shoulder snaps off in two seconds, which he doesn't do with other brand sleepsacks (like Grobag). I love the material and the extra zippers for different variations of opening. I just wish the shoulder snaps were a little stronger.",3
Jellystone Robot Pendant Teether - Stainless Steel,"My son isn't even a ""chewer"" but gets antsy at school & wiggles a lit. i got him this to direct his energies on. After two days of use, the back of the robots head cracked wide open to expose the black rope ""chain"". He's stopped wearing/using it because it will inevitably break off at that point on the head & he wants to hang on to it as long as possible. Was really excited about the item but now disappointed it broke after two days of use.",1
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe WrapSack Blanket, Sketchy Sport, Large","I love the soft lightweight 100% cotton (unfortunately made in China). This is the perfect wrap for summer months.The zipper at the bottom allows your baby to stay swaddled while changing a diaper. There are snaps at the shoulder and velcro for the wrap.The Large is a big wrap, big enough for a 14- 20 pound baby.",5
Snuza Portable Baby Movement Monitor,"We had the Angel care motion monitor and while I am so thankful for it's invention when it finally broke we found the Snuzza when looking to purchase another Angel care and decided to try it. It ROCKS! We had MANY false alarms when our Son went to far from the sensor pad , that is not an issue with the Snuzza. Whenever we went anywhere overnight we had to take a huge pack n play along with the whole under mattress sensor set up and it was a pain and babysitters always got confused. Once again that problem was eliminated with the Snuzza. I LOVE the freedom of being able to go anywhere. I always worried when my daughter or Son sleep on long car rides because they tend to bury their faces in the side of the car seat or slouch forward but I don't have to worry about it now. The Snuzza goes anywhere, is small and so easy to use. SIDS is VERY real and this will be the most important thing you will every buy to save your childs life. I highly recommend.",5
"Baby K'tan Baby Carrier, Black, X-Large","I bought this same carrier from a different website that had a slightly cheaper price on it, but wanted to review it here also in case the review helps anyone.I really love my K'tan. I started using it when my son was a couple weeks old, and he is 3 months old now. He loves the carrier, it is comfortable for him and he usually falls asleep in it pretty quickly. It's easy to figure out how to do the different positions, and I like that there's not a bunch of fabric to wrangle (like there is with Moby-style wraps). Once you get familiar with it you can get them into the carrier in a jiffy.It's comfortable for me, and I can go on long walks, take him to the grocery store, or just have my hands free at home to do things around the house. With the way you can use some of the fabric to hold their head in place, you can be 100% hands-free. I love it and would recommend it to any of my friends.",5
OXO Tot  12 Piece Baby Block Set,"It's a really nice product, easy to use and very handy for baby food, I started using it right away and is always keeping my little one's food- at the freezer or to go.",5
"RayShade&reg; UV Protective Stroller Shade Improves Sun Protection for Strollers, Joggers and Prams Black",It is easy to put on and remove. Looks fashionable. Very light weight. Perfect for sunny day and for the naps on the go.,5
"Badger Basket Portable Bassinet n Cradle with Toybox Base, Ecru",This bassinet is hard to put together. My husband can build anything and this bassinet took forever and looks awkward. We realized to get the cute ruffles on you had to disassemble the whole thing first. Waste of $$$ do not buy!,1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",The elder sister is very glad.and I am also very easy.she can also ride and it is satisfactory.Thank you very much !,5
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free High-Heat Resistant Classic Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology, 3-Pack",I noted my grandaughter has less gas using these bottles...they are easy to clean...the nipple is durable...she sucks strong and the nipple did not deform,5
Boppy Prenatal Sleep Wedge,"This wedge was worth whatever it cost (it seemed steep and frivolous at the time, but I was willing to gamble) because it works a lot better than trying to prop yourself up with regular pillows and it doesn't take up the entire bed like a full body pillow would. You do have to rearrange it when you roll over, but it's easier than getting a regular pillow reconfigured. When your belly gets bigger, it works best with either a big lazy dog or a firm bed pillow wedged behind your back for stability. This thing is definitely coming to the hospital with me when I deliver.",5
Seat Belt Buckle Guard,"This product has been a God send for my daughter!  She has a little one with Down's Syndrome that loves to wiggle out of her car seat, and she had learned how to unbuckle her seat belt.  This guard does not allow her to do this any longer which means a safe drive again!",5
"Untangled Living Anyware Collection Children's Stainless Steel Dish Set, 5 Pieces, Butterfly","This set is gorgeous. Solid, sturdy and visually beautiful. I agree with another review here. The scotch tape inside the cup should be left off. I used a scouring pad to get the goo off.",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"We've had the basic gate setup for over 5 years now and it is holding up beautifully.  Our only want for it during that time has been an automatic closing mechanism.  Bungee cords will work, but are less than ideal for that since they are a tad unsightly and somebody still needs to latch it.  Aside from that lone issue however, nothing has become loose, noticeably worn, or broken in that time.  It has stood up well to thousands of open-close cycles and has been terrific for controlling access for our dogs, as well as for corralling our now 4 year old son who has been able to open it since he was about 3.This has been an outstanding value for us and I would definitely choose it again.",5
"Thirsties Hemp Inserts 2 Pack, Small 6-18 Lbs","I bought these for a shower gift, it was on registry.  The person is very eco friendly and did alot of research and picked these.",5
"Munchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Vary","We have twins and this product is great, or so we thought.  Keeps both babies occupied for 20-30 mins, which is a lifesaver for us!  The greatest drawback, like most reviewers is it is the pits to clean!  After one session of banana, hard scrubbing by mom, a run through the dishwasher by dad, and now we're soaking in some heavy duty oxy type cleaner.....they're still not clean!!!You've got to be kidding me! This product needs a serious rethink.  Parents, especially parents of mulitples can not spend their day scrubbing this product clean.It is great in concept, but horrible for real life use!  I'm glad we received these as a gift, because I won't be buying them again, life is too short!",2
Safety 1st High-Def Digital Monitor,"The monitor is very clear, but the battery won't last the night.  Keep it plugged up if you can help it.",3
Fisher-Price Aquarium Take-Along Swing,This swing completely saved us over the holidays!  We took it to parties so that our newborn could sleep while we visited friends and relatives over the holidays.  It is super easy to transport and has the same calming effect as a full size swing.  I'm leaving mine with my full-time babysitter...I may have to buy another one!,5
Cloud b Gentle Giraffe On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds,I bought this when someone else recomended it to me. I chose the smaller version because i wanted something to attach to his car seat. It has a strap i attach it to the side of his car seat so he can  hear it when we are in the car. I would recomend this to any new mom.,5
&quot;A Little Pillow Company&quot; Hypoallergenic TODDLER PILLOW in White - 13&quot;x18&quot; (Ages 2 - 4),This is a wonderful pillow! My son just turned 2 and he loves it!!! I cant tell you how difficult it is to find a small pillow for a little guy. Most are way too bulky and have terrible reviews so I was very glad to find this company! I will be spreading the word around to my friends!,5
"Britax Boulevard 70 Convertible Car Seat, Silver Birch","After reading tons of reviews i settled on this seat.  I love the pattern as well.  It fits great in my SUV, even in the middle since we haven't moved her to a side yet.  It feel really secured when installed.  The LATCH connectors tighten easily.",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"Although I was apprehensive, this was a perfect fit for all of the stuffed and furry items in my kids bedroom.  Although not toddlers any more, my pre-teen has this above the buckbed in the corner.  Can't easily be reached by the dog (that's really important as the dog gets 'confused' as to which is a doggie toy and which isn't), but once up in the bed, all is accessible.  Easy to install too.great price for something which works so well.",5
Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer MODEL# TAT-2000C,The Exergen Temporal thermometer we received did not work.  It was not operator error (which is what I initially thought) and had to be replaced.  The second product works great!  We were just disappointed when the first one did not function.,4
"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Wander","My grandson loves it, he is 4 yr. old and just considers himself a big boy now, very safe and comfortable product",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"I bought this for all the stuffed animals in my daughters room, and it holds them okay, but it took us forever to figure out where to place the nails so it would hang right. The picture makes it look a lot bigger than it actually is also.",3
"Excellante' Wooden High Chair, Walnut (Packaging May Vary)","I purchased 2 high chairs for my 21 month old twin boys.  Over all I am pleased with their color and sturdiness.  They were easy to put together.  They are compact and easy to clean.I was however disappointed that they each had a dent/scratch that is very visible.  I did not feel like going through the hassle of returning them because I really wanted this style of high chairs.  (Click on """"view and share images"""" above to see the photos I added)",4
Mommy's Helper Cushie Traveler,This traveling potty seat is so cushie and well made. I think it will help when my grand daughter starts to potty train and make continue training easier.,5
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy",SIMPLY PUT:  I AM SO OBSESSED WITH THIS STROLLER.  IT IS A FANTASTIC BRAND AND EASY TO PUT TOGETHER.  VERY STURDY!,5
"Britax B-Safe Infant Car Seat, Black",My grand daughter loves this car seat. My g-grandson fits perfect and will last him a very long time. I feel he is very safe and the ease of putting it in the car is priceless even for a great grandma! Love this car seat worth every penny!,5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Print Boy, Large",We love HALO sleep sacks. Our girl is a mover and the sleep sack stays with her unlike a traditional blanket. We use fleece in the winter and purchased this for warmer months. She know when the sleep sack comes out it's bed time. Would recommend to any parents instead of blankets. We will use them until she out grows the largest sizes.,5
Mommy's Helper Safe-Lok Cabinet Door and Drawer Lock,Not sure why but the safety feature that keeps their fingers from being pinched quit working on half of my cabinets within about a week. They do still keep the doors from opening though so at least that worked. I'm confident it was not an operator error since I do still have some of them functioning as described.,2
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"We received the Diaper Dekor over a year ago as a shower gift, yes I registered for it. It looked and sounded great. We loved it at first, it was easy to use and change. Once the heat went on in our son's room we noticed it didn't hold the odor in. Then as our son started to walk a few months ago, we have been missing a few items (ie the remote, cordless phone) I keep finding them in the Diaper Dekor. Also, I have found a few diapers outside the Diaper Dekor that I know were at one point inside it. My next concern is when our son learns how to open the front door and finds the cutter. I plan to go buy a different diaper pail before that happens.",2
Sassy Happy Hippo Bath Shower Spray,"Bought this as a gift for my assistant, who informed me that it doesn't stay on the faucet very well...so that's a drag.",3
25 mm One-Piece Breastshield w/ Valve and Membrane for Medela Breast Pumps; Set of 2; Made by Maymom,The order came on time.  Appreciate that the breast flange is attached so that there are less parts to assemble.  Appreciate that the suction tubing connector is more secure than the original medela part,5
"Bamboobies 2 Pair Ultra-Thin Regular Nursing Pads, Pale Pink","I would recommend this product to moms who have low to moderate leaking. I've leaked through one of them once by the end of the day, but otherwise they've worked and as a new mom I leak quite a bit (I was engorged). I like that they are so soft and that they are reusable.  The heart shape doesn't make them invisible in my bra, but with a shirt over them and the bra it's fine. These are definitely better than the generic less expensive pads that I've gotten that have itchy seams - these are smooth on the edges.",4
"Chicco 360 Hook on High Chair, Midori","Daughter and grandson, easy clean, take anywhere and makes toddler feel more part of the family. thanks chicco love this!",5
Baby Safe Ink Print Kit - Basic,"Used it with my 1 month old, and it was a mess! Also VERY hard to remove, took 2 of us about 20min to safely remove it all from her hands and feet in the bath tub (wipe that they sent with it didn't help at all), not to mention all other body parts she happened to get it on.  Highly would NOT recommend it to use on a baby! Very disappointed and will not be using the last ink pad.",1
Personalized Pacifiers Skull Pacifier in Black,Cute binky that makes a statement. My husband loved it. I recommend this product and have never seen it in the store.,5
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)",although these bottles were great in helping decrease gas the nipples holes were quite small i had to use a fork to open them up more.  When reading the directions you can't use a bottle warmer or boiling water.  How do u sterilize them?? Heating the bottle up took forever because you can only use warm water. who has time to wait that long with a hungry baby??,3
"Skip Hop Zoo Reusable Sandwich and Snack Bag Set, Bee","I got these bags to carry around in my diaper bag to store snacks and other food items for my son. They are a great size and work wonderfully carrying baby food pouches, Mum Mum biscuits and other snacks. They're also lined so they're easy to clean out and dry quickly. The one thing I don't like about them is that the material seems kind of cheap and they don't match the puppy backpack perfectly in color but other then that we really like these and hope to use them for a long time.",4
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","I love it, my baby loves it and the fact that works with a regular electrical out let, even better so you don't have to keep spending money on batteries. ( you also have the option to use batteries if you chose).Great product, great quality, babies love them... My brother got one for his baby as well .... You will not regret it, and with the amazon pricing, you cant go wrong..",5
Baby Jack Blankets Yellow Circles Lovey,I purchased a Baby Jack blanket for my nephew when he was about 5 months old.  It was an immediate hit!  He is now 15 months and still loves his &#34;tabs&#34; as we call it.  I've now purchased the next size up for him.,5
Infant Optics DXR-8 Pan/Tilt/Zoom 3.5&quot; Video Baby Monitor With Interchangeable Optical Lens,I bought this for our 3 mo. baby girl and we loved it. Relatively expensive but it's worth the extra money. We live in a townhouse with 2 levels and the reception has been good all round. Never had wifi issues with our apple TV or smartphones computers and stuff. It's surprising to see how clear the picture is even at night when all the lights are out and curtains closed. Would be recommending this to my friends.,5
"Boon Bug Pod Bath Toy Scoop,Red","I love this so far. It looks really fun in our shower, is bigger than I expected, and serves its purpose. Noticing that others had problems with the adhesive sticking, I was sure to follow every single step of the directions to hang it. It's been hanging on the shiny tile wall of my shower for about a month now with the adhesive and has not fallen down yet.Update: It did end up falling down after about 3 months. Planning on hanging it differently.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I have given Sophie to several infants, beginning with my grandson.  They were only available on the Upper East Side of Manhattan back then.  This was on a registry but I had already purchased it.  I know Itsy will love it.",5
Ubbi Steel Diaper Pail in White,"Basically I just want to second Dressy Grad Student's review. I can't for the life of me figure out how anyone could give this pail a good rating when there is no way to empty it without ripping the bag. It is a MAJOR design flaw, and one that's SO obvious and SO simple that I guarantee I could build a better functioning model of the exact same can out of LEGO. It doesn't take any design or engineering skill whatsoever to see how poorly the hinge mechanism on the bag holder is made, and if ANY ONE PERSON involved in the design of this can had actually tried to remove a plastic garbage bag full of ANYTHING (let alone used diapers) from this can, they would have noticed the unbelievably ludicrous flaw and relocated the bag holder hinge, or at least put some sort of smooth guard over it to prevent every single bag from tearing. As it is, they decided to sell a substandard product rather than spending an extra $0.73 on parts to make  the hinge external to the can. The only thing I can figure is they were either drunk, high, or simply trying to prank parents who paid an exorbitant price for a simple, poorly designed steel pail.UPDATE 7/16/13:  After my poor initial review Ubbi was kind enough to send me a redesigned bag holder with a smoother hinge. We've been using the new holder now for about 8 months and have had MUCH better luck removing the bags from the container. Plastic bags still get caught once in a while, but they no longer completely rip apart like they did before. A couple small holes in the bag is the worst I've had to deal with, so it still requires a second garbage back to put the first one in, but overall the system actually works now. As far as keeping odor out of the baby's room, it does an exceptional job of that until you open the trap door to put a new diaper in. I've gotten pretty good at opening the door concurrently with pushing the rolled up dirty diaper in and it minimizes the smell. Overall I am fairly satisfied with the product now. One final recommendation is to take the container out of the baby's room into a room with an exhaust vent in order to empty it!",4
Munchkin 3 Count Stay Put Suction Bowl,"Some of the older reviews are for the old style of bowl-- there were 3 bowls with one removable suction bottom-- they weren't so great. The new bowls have an attached suction bottom, and I just love them! I'm back to buy a second set. I moisten the bottom with a bit of water, push down onto the dining room table, and the bowls stay there until I pull them up. The set comes with 3 different sizes; the smallest is perfect for one scrambled egg or a handful of blueberries, while the largest holds a dinner sized portion of pasta. The lids go on and click audibly so you know they've closed, and they are easily opened by an adult. They're perfect for preschool!I have a few other types of bowls, but for my toddler, these are definitely the ones I reach for.",5
"Dreambaby 10.5&quot; Gate Extension, White",The item was in in new condition and was as described.  I would order this item again.  It worked well with the gate I bought.,5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,"The monitor works very well, no noise and crystal clear. Love the talk-back function, wish they would make a model for two room monitoring so we can use it for two kids.",5
"Trend Lab Ultimate Diaper Bag, Brown/Blue","We got this diaper bag because it's a neutral looking style/color (orange and gray) for my husband and I to both carry, and has an adjustable strap for our very different heights and body types.I need the bag straps much much shorter than he does, and when the bag is shortened to the extent I need it to be carried, over the head/shoulder and across the chest so I can carry 1yr old and have free movement to hold 2.5yr old's hand the bag is completely uncomfortable.  I've had cheap/free bags from the hospital or give-a-aways that are better suited for us.Also when in shortened position, the metal slider either gets in the way of the shoulder pad so it doesn't actually sit on your shoulder, it is either on your chest/back or you can force the slider to go into the shoulder cushion, but then the cushion sits funny and is also uncomfortably feelable underneath.Not at all versatile if you need something more than 2 people will be carrying/sharing.",1
"OXO Tot 2 Count Handy Stroller Hook, Silver/Green",Whether using it to keep a child close to a cart or stroller or as a way to hang much needed bags from the stroller - these are a life saver! Grocery bags work very well - just be careful on very light strollers so the weight doesn't tip them backwards. Potable and easy on and off! You might need more!,5
"green sprouts Stacking Cup Set, Colors may vary","These cups are on the smallish side and I wish they were a little more brightly colored.  That being said, my eight month old adores them.  He will play with them non-stop in the bath, on the floor and in his crib.  Since he is the end consumer, I will put aside my minor quibbles and rate them as he would.  Five stars all the way!",5
"OXO Tot On-the-Go Wipes Dispenser, Pink","Slim for bags and really only pulls one wipe out at a time. It takes some time getting used to opening the top, but once you get the hang of it, it really is one-handed and makes diaper changes much less stressful! I use this for disposable and cloth wipes.",5
"Skip Hop Bento Diaper Tote Bag, Black","Love this bag.  Not too feminine as the wife put this bag in my car.  She doesn't like the compartments and things and prefers to just use a larger bag with one opening.  I, on the other hand, like the compartments and places to put things in.  Works well for my use.",5
"The First Years Car Seat Cover, Gray",It was made of nice material.  It was very warm for child.  It was a great purchase for the money.,5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I am in love with this pump - I just started back to work after a 12 week maternity leave and was in need of a good breast pump to continue nursing my daughter. I couldn't decide whether to bite the bullet and purchase a Medela Pump in Style or this one. I have had an electric pump in the past (First Years Dual Pump) and really didn't care for it - it was so noisy, at times wouldn't have great suction, as ws awkward to handle while breastfeeding my baby on one side. I felt like I was constantly prisoner to the electric outlet sine I couldn't move anywhere since it was so comlicated to get everything together.This pump was quiet, fast (8 ounces in under 15 minutes from both breasts) and needed no electric outlet. At first I was afraid my hand would get sore, but no problem at all. I had better luck w/out the petal cushion - this just didn't work for me, and I've never had a problem stimulating letdown without it.I am so glad I didn't purchase a PIS, I also love the bottles, they're the only kind my baby will use!",5
Aden and Anais Serenity Star,"First - it took a whole day to gauge the correct temperature of the room. That's annoying, that it glowed red the whole day, thinking it was 80 degrees in my room. The buttons are there, and it's functional, but the buttons are tiny and awkward to use. Additionally, it's a pretty big star, so it's hard to tote around with you from place to place if you're not always nursing in the same place (which will also cause the temperature to be off again). I returned it, because it just wasn't practical.",1
"North States 3 in 1 Metal Superyard 2 Panel Extension, Taupe",Adding the extension set seemed to almost double the play space inside the enclosed area.This converts the starting set from a 6 sided to a full 2 x 2 square.Attaches easily and sturdy.,5
The First Years Simple &amp; Secure Stair Gate,"Choosing a gate was very confusing!  I rely heavily upon reviews, but it was still overwhelming.  I'm extremely happy I chose this gate, it's just wonderful.Installation did take a while, so that is my only complaint.  But the gate works well (is at the top of the stairs).  You can choose for the gate to open both ways (swinging), or to swing to one side or another side (you use one of two pieces when installing, depending on which way you want it to go).Can open with one hand, which is a plus.  I feel this gate is very safe, and would highly recommend it to anyone and everyone:)",5
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","We were given this tub from a friend and we were thankful because it was great. my lil guy loved being in the tub we would give him two baths a day but since hes gotten older, he is a very active lil stinker and he likes to push against the other backboard and gets his butt off the seat then slides in. even when im watching him hand and foot he does it and im scared that he will go under fully one of these times if im not fast enough. other than that it is very nice. just be careful if you have a hyper active boy like mine =)",3
2 Inch Foam Bassinet Mattress - 15&quot; x 30&quot; x 2&quot;,"Mattress itself was ok and fulfilled my needs.I changed my shipment option from 2 days to next day delivery since I needed it immediately and paid additional charge for that. I did NOT receive the mattress in time but still - I was charged additional money - higher rate - as for the ''next day'' shipment. The item arrived as it would with the regular Prime delivery instead. Very upset about that. Also the item arrived with the cardboard outside box damaged and broken almost in half, however - the mattress was in one piece and covered with its original nylon cover. I never had the chance to contact Customer service and request my money back and/or explanation for the delayed shipment since I was way too busy at this time to deal with that, thus my need for immediate delivery of the mattress.",3
The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier,I bought this clipper because I already have a set that I LOVE!  But the set I got from Amazon is terrible.  They are dull or something.  I gave it 3 stars for the faulty clippers I got.  My first set was great. Not sure which one is the norm.,3
Britax B-Agile Stroller Child Tray,Does everything I expected it to do. Easy to take on and off or just to lift in order to get my son out. Perfect!,5
"Graco Charleston Non-Drop Classic Crib, Cherry",I ended up ordering this crib from Walmart because it was $20 cheaper. When we took the crib out of the box it was very cute and a lot larger than I expected. My only complaint is that the wood is soft. My husband leaned the crib against an end table and it made a 2 inch gouge in one of the slats. But overall this crib is well worth the money!,4
"The First Years True Choice P400 Premium Digital Monitor, 2 Parent Unit","I have been using this for about a week and it works with no problem. We put the main monitor in the basement and one on the second floor as well as one on the main floor. There was no place we could go that had a problem with reception. I turned on the microwave, and no interference (I did this because my old wireless router had a problem and every time the microwave was turned on I had no internet access). The sound quality is excellent. VERY clear, no echo's and no static. It is very easy to use and my 6 year old likes to use it as a walkie-talkie. This is a great way for us to listen to what is going on while the kids are playing in the basement and I would recommend this to anyone with children....not just infants. The units are fairly thin and feel flimsy....I was not prepared for the sound quality that came out of these. I should note that I have an old house (built in 1912) with heavy lathe. I don't know how this would work in newer condo's and/or apartments with thick concrete floors, etc....but we placed these as far as possible, and even behind our stone foundation (there is a part of the basement that we can access) and we had no interference. Set up couldn't be easier, and everything is very intuitive and easy to use. The only worry for me is if these fell they would probably break....but then, they can easily be placed in a descrete location where they are out of sight and touch. I am very happy with it!",5
Arm's Reach Concepts Mini Co-Sleeper Organic Fitted Bassinet Sheet,This sheet fit our mini co-sleeper perfectly and the velcro keeps the edges very secured. Note: undoing and re-doing the velcro can be loud if you are changing baby's sheets in the middle of the night!,5
Basic Comfort Contoured Changing Pad by Summer Infant,This is your basic changing pad. It is a great size - it fits perfectly on a bureau. The curved sides keep the baby in place.,4
"Luvable Friends Flannel Fitted Crib Sheet, Yellow Circle","This flannel sheet was as cheap as I could find one, and the quality seems excellent.  I was happy that it actually fits the crib mattress perfectly and snugly (no wrinkles) and it is very soft and warm.  Helps when laying the baby down on colder nights.",5
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"While the expression of this product is unique and started out quite effective, I noticed the longer I pumped with this pump the less milk I was able to get.  Milk has been leaking around the breast while I pump, and if any milk goes near the rim of the bottle while it is screwed on very tightly it leaks right out the side.  Very disappointing!",1
"Bumkins Cloth Diaper Cover, Blue Cat",This diaper doesn't feel waterproof at all. Baby's clothing feels damp all over after she pees. I (unfortunately) bought three of them and they all do the same thing so it's not like its a fluke or anything. Total waste of money.,1
"Graco Ready2Grow Classic Connect LX Stroller, Metropolis","good buy. like it. it'll last me a long time. (hopefully) it's a little bigger than I expected, but understandable.  I have not used it yet, but can't wait to use it.",4
Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy,"This is great.  It's a really simple product that does the job.  I purchased 2 of these for each of our Baby Jogger City Mini GTs.  It is a very convenient place to put a sippy cup, toy, and of course....goldfish crackers:)  It kills me that alot of strollers don't include this (considering the cost of the freaking stroller).  But I love Diono brand and like this product!",5
Nurseryworks Sight-Two Sweet Violet Tisket 6 Pc Crib Set,"I'm so glad I decided to buy this crib bedding set. We are having a first baby, and don't know if it's a boy or girl so we wanted something gender neutral. This bedding set is great quality, especially for the price (have you seen some of the prices they charge for high end crib bedding??). It reminds me of the jungle or rainforest. We also decided to buy the extra fitted crib sheet and I'm sure it'll come in handy. For the most part, we were glad to find crib bedding that wasn't cheesy/corny looking and had a bold print and was good quality...problem solved.",5
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","I got this gate in white for my small dog. I wanted vertical bars that he couldn't climb. The gate has worked out perfectly. It is easy to install (I did not use the screws) and so simple to open and close. I like that it will close automatically or stay open if opened all the way. Plus, it has a nice clean look. I am so pleased with this purchase, I bought another for a different doorway.",5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is the very best potty seat!  I wish I'd had it when my younger boys were potty training.  I love how it has an adjustment on the bottom so it can fit any kind of toilet seat.  No worries about my son slipping & falling in the potty.  Yes, it's $$$ but so very worth it.",5
Mommy's Helper Slide-Lok Bi-Fold Door Lock,I ordered this product as I was ordering many other toddler safety products.  It has been a handy safety piece in locking closet doors once we transitioned our son into a toddler bed.  It's mom-friendly too (just slides left or right with ease).,5
JL Childress Cups 'N Cargo,"I have a 3 year old and a 4 month old and this Cups 'N Cargo has actually replaced the Diaper Bag. I put it on the stroller when we're out, and when I bring it into the house I can just hang it on a door knob. It's exactly what I needed.",5
Rockin' Green Classic Rock Lavender Mint Revival 45oz,"I used too much of this in my load of cloth diaper laundry, and it gave my 13-month-old daughter the worst diaper rash she's ever had after wearing just two diapers from that load. To be fair, she has pretty sensitive skin, but I was very surprised that the reaction was so horrible. So please don't use too much Rockin' Green detergent with your diapers, especially if your baby is sensitive. I describe this experience in more detail on my blog if you're interested: [...]",3
Instant Murals 2 Sheets Butterfly and Flower Mural Wall Transfers,"These look totally amazing! Like they were hand-painted. You can't tell they are stickers. so thin, you can't feel them on the wall.I put them on super glossy oil, which the directions say can be hard, and it was. Took about 5 minutes per sticker, going really slowly but it was worth it!",5
The First Years Take and Toss 28-Piece Feeding Variety Pack,it has everything u nd! no nd to buy extra utensils...its microwave safe. but plastic is thin..so if put hot water in it..feels hot holding it.,5
Tommee Tippee Travel Bottle and Food Warmer,"Before we got this, feeding the baby while we were out meant that we had to beg for a suitable mug / basin / container and hot water from the wait-staff wherever we happened to be. More often than not, they would return with either a mug that was too small to hold enough hot water, water that was not hot enough, or both, if they managed to get back to us at all. Bringing our own hot water was not much of a problem, but lugging around a suitable container to warm the milk was inconvenient. This product solves all these problems.Pros:- Keeps the water very hot for hours.- It holds around 500ml of liquid. I find that it is enough hot water for 2 uses of warming up fridge-temperature breastmilk.- The white plastic &#34;cup&#34; is roomy and deep enough to fit any type of bottle you might have. It's so handy that we even use it when we're at home (instead of the big beer stein that we used before this).- Simple push-button to open up for pouring and to lock . No fiddling necessary.- The design is simple but clever, having the cup and the actual thermos screw into each other so that it saves space.- Has held up to 3 months of daily use (both in the home and outside) so far. Should last for a long time more.Cons:- Keeps the water very hot for hours. Seriously. Very HOT water. Use with common sense and you should be fine.10/10 would buy again!",5
Skip Hop Saddle Bag-Charcoal,"I love the Chicco Liteway but we know with all umbrella strollers, there is limited basket space.  This fits my needs perfect for the day at the zoo or any other trip that will last about half a day.  The bag is small as other post have said but it fit a lot!I have the following in my bag:Front zipper pocket: Child size spoon and fork, 4 wet ones singles, kleenex, neosporan spray, and a small first first aid kitInside pocket: Two size 5 diapers, ziplock bag of wipes, arm and hammer diaper baggy, disposable changing pad, a pack of table toppers, neutrogena sunblock for body and the face sunblock, ace instant compress, a light weight wind jacket, and a change of clothes.I can now put this on the outside and put just our lunch box in the basket.  I'm IN LOVE!",5
Motorola Audio Visual Cable for MBP 33 and MBP36 Digital Video Baby Monitors,"Cable seems to be fine, but video quality is poor. It most likely has to do with output resolution from video monitor.So, if your looking to view on TV, your outta luck.",1
Eddie Bauer Car Seat Travel Bag,AWSOME! Had this for 8 years now...Still going strong on kid #3! I highly recommend this product. 5 stars! WINNER!,5
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Black Velboa",Purchased this for my second child so that I could use a jogging stroller for walks (before the 6 mos. guideline). Ended up using the head piece in her carseat as well (no need for the body insert).  I worry less and she looks more comfortable because her head doesn't fall down on her chest while sleeping in it; wish I had this for my first kid!,5
"Jumping Beans&reg; Frog Hooded Bath Towel, in Green","again, super cute. my daughter loves it. She has to have one of her cute little animal towels every night.",5
Ameda Custom Breast Flanges with Insert,"I bought these to see if bigger horns helped me get more milk.  They do not.  The inserts are a joke--totally useless and annoying.  The larger horns are convenient for when my regular ones are dirty, but are no more or less comfortable and I get the same amount of milk, if not a little less.",4
"Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Double Sided Wipes, Blue Emb.",I am cloth diapering and I first purchased osocozy wipes - which are nice but stitching is coming off after several washes and I found I didn't have enough so I bought a package of these to try and oh my! These are a little more expensive but well worth the $$$... they are so soft and not only make a great cloth wipe but function as a nice washcloth too. They seem to be holding up well with washes too.I would highly recommend spending a few more dollars and buying these instead of other wipes!,5
Munchkin 4 Pack White Hot Safety Spoon,I have used these spoons several times to feed our 7 month old and have noticed that they stain easily. They are hand washed and the stains do not come off. I have not tried cleaning them in the dishwasher.,3
Philips AVENT BPA Free Twin Electric Breast Pump,I ordered this so my wife could pump while at work.  She is an RN working 12hr shifts at night.  The pump never primed right out of the box called to return it and the seller said to call the company and get a new pump I did that and it didn't work.  So I called again to get another one.  I still haven't seen it so I don't know if it will work or not.  Go with a pump that at least works I don't think this is a good purchase.,2
"Munchkin Extending Metal Gate, White",Well built.  Installation template makes install easy.  Swings in and out which is great for top of stairs.  Keeps the grandkids corraled perfectly.,5
"Rainbow Diapers 4.0 One Size Pocket Cloth Diapers LOT OF 10 - MIX &amp; MATCH with Microfiber Insert Reusable, Washable - Similar to BumGenius","I will start out by saying, I LOVE BUM GENIUS! The rainbow diapers are definitely softer feeling than bum genius and are not as bulky. However, when I go to change my son after a couple of hours the outer covering is all wet and so are his clothes.  I can put a bum genius on him for 3+ hours, pull out the liner and it feels like it is going to drip, but yet my son's clothes are dry.  These diapers just don't hold as much liquid the bum genius inserts.  I ordered one of these diapers to try it out. Also when I received the diaper the stitching was coming loose. I contacted them and the problem was quickly resolved, so I would give them a 10 when it comes to costumer service.  I purchased my bum genius diapers on sale and paid just under $12 diapers a diaper.  For a couple dollars more I would purchase bum genius diapers.",2
DEX Products Grab N Go Bottle Warmer BWC-01,"I bought this in mind for obviously when Im out to keep bottles warm. 1st of all as soon as you mesh the button it starts to warm-a bit of a wait(okay, a long time of a wait) & then that is it! One time use. You have to re-boil it for another use. Pointless!",1
Logan + Lenora Waterproof Wet Bag 'Earthy Owls' Medium,I'm obsessed with these bags.  I have 2.  You can use them as wet bags but... if you don't have a baby (which I don't) you can also use them for loads of other things.  Especially great for travel because if stuff spills inside it doesn't make a gigantic mess for the rest of your suitcase.  And they are beautiful.  Stylish and practical.  I love giving these as gifts to my mom-to-be friends. Cause who doesn't love owning baby stuff that isn't covered in ugly primary colors and stupid designs? The material is super quality so it will last after your baby is no longer a baby and then you can use it for other stuff and not feel like a chump.  RECOMMENDED!  SUPER SATISFIED!,5
myBaby Soundspa Lullaby Sound Machine and Projector,"I initially bought this projector when my daughter was very young (around 9 mos). It seemed to help her sleep a bit, but there was still a real struggle at night to keep her in bed. After about 6 months or so, the projector broke and began making a loud noise, so we threw it out and forgot about it.In the following years, my daughter continued to give us a struggle before bedtime. It peaked soon after she turned 3, when putting her to bed became my hell on earth. I now refer to that period as &#34;the dark days.&#34; Every night, there would be a screaming fight involving her getting out of bed 1000 times and my husband and I eventually turning on each other out of stress. Desperate and sleep deprived, I sought out this projector, having known it's quality from my previous purchase.For a year and a half now, since I bought this projector a second time, there has been no struggle. She is 4 years old and looks forward to bedtime, thanks to this machine. It broke after about a year of continuous use, but it still makes noise and projects an image on the wall that doesn't rotate. This machine is worth its weight in gold.",5
Bright Starts Lots of Links- Solid Colors,"These links are my baby's favorite toy! As I am a new mom, when I got them I didn't think they would have any use, but they are awesome! They have helped my baby to develop his grabbing skills. They are also great to hang other toys from the car-seat handle and other places. And for itchy gums they are a great thing to put in the mouth.",5
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey",This works great.  It looks much better than the non-adhesive cushion and so far our 10 mo old daughter has not attempted to pull it off.  She actually enjoys chewing it as if it is a teether and it doesn't even leave a mark (she has 2 teeth).  It provides a lot of padding and most importantly to us it pads the corners of our tables greatly.,5
Bright Starts Sugar Blossom Melodies Bouncer,Good bouncer for the price.  Not sure why they put a teether on the toy bar...baby can't lean neck 7 inches to reach it...other than that it is a great baby chair!,4
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,"I bought two of these covers, the other was the Organic Linen material.  I live in Hawaii so I feel my baby is too warm underneath the cover.  I still use it however, especially in the car with the air on or other well air conditioned placed.  Definitely recommend it on plane rides, I just kept the cover over him and it allowed him to sleep and I felt if kept his little nose from drying out.The Organic Linen material is thick and not soft like I had anticipated it to be- it's sort of a scratchy material.  Like a very thin, tightly woven burlap materia.  The items wash well however and don't shrink.(at least mine didn't) I iron mine from time to time but only because I don't care for the wrinkled look when it comes out of the dryer.Cons:  Over priced and wished material was thinner for warm climates.Other than that, the product is good and covers baby well.",4
Baby Einstein Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym,"I thought this play mat was a little pricey, but liked the Ocean theme. I did pay less for it on Amazon than the listed price at Target or Babies R US. I like the vibrant colors and that the musical piece can detach. There are a lot of places to clip on the items that hang down and can be moved. Sometimes the bottom of the arches bunch up and don't lay flat and that is a little annoying. Overall a good product though!",4
Dapper Snapper Baby &amp; Toddler Adjustable Belt ~ Navy,now that my baby is not using diapers it's hard to find pants that fit him so i bought this belt. can't say it helps 100% but pants fit him better now then before. i just dont like how the pants gather in the back but it's doable!,4
The First Years Magna Light Stroller - Cappuccino,"This was a great purchase for $[...]. The only (small) criticism I have is its bulkiness when folded.  I'm sure this is typical for most strollers of this size, but I was somewhat spoiled by the compactness of the frame stroller the car seat carrier sits on.  The Magna Light folds easily but takes up a bit of room in the trunk.  On a more positive note, it reclines back all the way and is very spacious for the baby.  It's sturdy and seems well constructed.  Overall, definitely a good buy.",4
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","I received this carrier as a gift in April 2005.  My son was born in July 2005 and we have just begun using the carrier more frequently (now that he can face out, and now that we are venturing out to more ""non-stroller friendly"" events).  My husband loves the ""belly pack"" as we call it -- we did not have to buy the extra long straps (my husband is 6 ft. and I'm 5'5"").  I have only washed my carrier 3 times at the most and I just noticed the fabric fraying on the outside part that folds down.  I contacted BabyBjorn (provided them with the UPC, serial #, etc.) and they are sending me a new outside part right away!  I am very impressed with their customer service and would highly recommend the product.  I also have the ""ultimate baby wrap"" in grey cotton and I really like it.  It is great for traveling as it folds up compactly into it's own carry case -- about the size of half a loaf of bread -- and you can throw it over your shoulder.  If BabyBjorn could create a special carry bag for the carrier that would be excellent!",5
"5 Pack - Black Foam Microphone Windscreens (Lifetime Warranty, Bulk Packaging)","It's exactly what you should expect for the money. If you had planned on using it with a Blue Yeti, the filters just barely fit over the top of the mic, and it doesn't reach the bottom of the top mesh. The filter must be stretched over the mic if you attempt to use one, keep in mind it will be very tight.",4
Lucy Darling Shop Monthly Bodysuit Baby Sticker - Baby Girl - Milestone Stickers - 12 Stickers,This is a great product and better than what I expected. I am very happy with my purchase. Thank you very much!,5
Kidkusion Toddler Corner Kushions Off White - 4 Pack,Our Kushions are secured with black electrical tape running around the entire parameter of the table/coffee table/etc. Not a pretty site but I have seen my son bounce off these soft edges several times now without even a wimper!! They do protect him. After his first encounter with a coffee table corner resulting in a large goose-egg  on his forehead; I'll take safe vs style ANY day!,4
Cooling Gel Pillow,"You don't have to keep these in the Refrigerator, but I do. They stayed quite cool for several hours. The person I used them on really liked them.  Said it helped them feel more comfortable.",5
Philips AVENT Newborn Starter Set,"When registering for baby products, my husband and I had no idea where to start with choosing baby bottles, so of course we assumed the Avent were the best since they are more expensive.  We quickly learned our lesson!  We used the bottles for a month, my daughter was always so cranky after a feeding and we couldn't figure out why.  It turned out that it was gas that was causing her so much pain.  She would scream and scream!  We finally realized, after noticing all of the bubbles in the bottle, there was too much air getting into her belly! On top of that her shirt would be soaked after a feeding, the smallest nipple they have for those bottles is still too much for an infant.  She would drink the bottle so fast and it would just pour down her cheek onto the front of her.  Needless to say we stopped using the Avent bottles, (now that we have 2 dozen!) and switched to the Playtex Ventaire, it was such a huge difference, no bubbles in the bottle, no belly pain from gas, and no formula stained shirt!  We love these new bottles.",1
Bumkins Waterproof Sleeved Bib - On-The-Go,"I like these they are great, they do the job they are intended to do and protect my LO's clothes from all the messiness of solids!",4
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"We've been using this monitor since DD was born 9.5 months ago.  Overall, we've been very pleased with it.  It does everything you want a baby monitor to do, has a built-in rechargeable battery, and beeps when it is out of range. I would buy it again.The reason for four stars instead of five is that it doesn't give you any warning when the battery is about to die.  It starts to beep until you plug it in when the battery is dead.  That was a rude wake-up call at one point, so I started keeping the cord at my bedside.UPDATE 4/23/13:  This monitor is still going strong almost three years later!  We have had no issues with it whatsoever.  I leave both units plugged in almost all the time, so the battery life has been shortened somewhat, but it's still good enough that I can take it off for several hours if we are going to be downstairs for a long time in the evening.  I would buy this again, no problem, despite the low battery Beep of Doom. :)",4
CherryCreek Decals Cherry Blossom &amp; Birds Decorative Nursery/Room Wall Sticker Decals,"I bought this decal for my baby's nursery. It took me about half an hour to apply the design to the wall, but it was an easy, intuitive, and fun process. The product comes with four sheets of decals and a simple instruction sheet. The instruction sheet has an illustration depicting how the image is supposed to look like, and each main piece (e.g. branch sections w/ flowers) is labeled with a number. There are also some unlabeled pieces (e.g., birds, flowers, leaves) whose placement you determine by looking at the picture.  That took some time but was easy to figure out. The decal seems to stick to the wall with a light adhesive, and the pieces are easy to remove and relocate. (I recommend not pressing down too hard on each piece when you first apply the decals, incase you need to adjust the placement. But definitely press firmly once you're satisfied with the placement, to prevent falling pieces and choking hazards).I also really like the design and colors. The shades of pink are not too girly, and the design gives the room a touch of nature. My baby enjoys pointing at the birds and flowers. Overall, this is a great product at a great price, and I highly recommend it.",5
"Baby Jogger 2012 City Mini Single Stroller, Green/Gray","I love the ease that it folds up, and the size when it's folded. I love how smoothly it rolls and easy it is to run/walk with.",5
"Badger Basket Barrel Top Toy Box, Natural",Cute toy box. Safe for our Grandkids. A little hard to assemble; required 2 sets of hands to manage the pieces.,4
"Baby Banz Hearing Protector Earmuffs, Blue",They seem to work....my grandson loves to ride my husbands lawn mower and tractor. He's only 10 months so wanted to protect his ears.,5
Bath Luve with Bath Buddy by Just Born,"I use this to keep my four month old warm when taking a bath. At first she hated baths, but now she really enjoys them. I don't believe this one thing is what changed her mind, but I do believe it made her more comfortable.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"I bought 6 other gates and none of them fit on my stairwell because I have molding trim around the bottom.  This gate was so easy to install and it is easy to open.  I did, however, have to buy 1 extension piece, but who cares.  It keeps my now 11 month old away from the steps! It was so easy I bought a 2nd one for the upstairs stairwell.",5
"Boppy Newborn Lounger, Geo",Our 3 week old baby loves this lounger.  It's like a bean bag chair but for a baby.  The foam is firm and cover seems durable but you can not take it off to wash.  We use it for him to play and feed.  I would definitely recommend this to any new parent.,5
"Munchkin 2 Pack Mighty Grip Spill-Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","This sippy cup only lasted us a few months.  I liked how easy it was for my daughter to use and how quickly is came apart to clean, but my daughter chewed through the spout within a week.  I would be happy to replace the spouts however I can't find them online anywhere.  Even the munchkin website was out of stock.  I will be cutting my losses and tossing them all.  We have moved to a more durable cup; the tommee tippee explora truly spill proof drinking cup.  It's a better design if you have a child with teeth because the soft plastic  valve is inside the lid covered by  a hard plastic spout.  That may not have made sense, but since switching, we haven't had a drop of milk spilled and no need for replacement parts.",2
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Sleeping Bag, Oh Boy, Small",Any of the Aden and Anais sleep sacks are great but I preferred the thin ones such as this one.  The thick ones are good for winter use but even then I found that fleece sleepers or just footed sleepers with this over them worked great.Pros:Lightweight but still provides good warmth because of materialWash wellVery softCons:This is not a true con but something worth noting.  I thought the sack was a little bigger than I expected but still fit well around the arms and gave room to grow.,5
Evenflo Splash Mega Exersaucer,What a horrible product. Cheap plastic all over & it came in a very damaged box. It is a shame because seemed very cute on the pictures.,1
Citrus Circles Diaper Pail Deodorizing Disks,"Great product, after 2 years and lots of missed smells.  That's right, works great and last.",5
"Bright Starts Comfort and Harmony Portable Swing, Florabella","I highly recommend this swing!  We just had our first baby and ordered this not really knowing what to expect.  It exceeded our expections.  Folds up and will travel very easily!  However this swing was only used by my son for about the first 2 1/2 mo.  He's 4 mo. now and I can't remember the last time he was in it.  It's definintely geared more for newborns.  He slept in it a few nights, after telling our Dr. (asking if she thought it was okay) she didn't recommend it for safety reasons, so after that he was only in the swing when we could be nearby and watch him.",5
"CoCaLo Jacana Plush Toy, Monkey","Nice looking toy. I bought it to go withBoutique Animal Kingdom 13PCS CRIB BEDDING SETand it is a perfect fit. However, after less than 4 weeks of use... and by 'use' I mean sitting in my daughter's crib (she's a newborn so it wasn't being played with or handled much at all), the stitching around they toy's eye has come undone!! What a disappointment.",2
Graco Pack 'n Play Playard - Dempsey,"This playard is easy to put together and take apart. The best part about it is that it has the storage feature underneath in the playard area while the bassinet is being used. However, the shelves only go halfway into the playard...wished it went all the way so that I could utilize all that extra space down there. While there are many other features that come with this playard, they each have their own flaws.-Bassinet- After only using it for 2 days the bassinet came apart, but was able to call customer service and get a replacement. The replacement has been working okay for 3 months now. Why only okay? For some reason, it sinks in the middle and has always been so since we first started to use it. I've tried adjusting the mattress and it still dips in the middle. It is still functional, but for something that the baby is sleeping on I wish it was sturdier. My 4 month old gets really frustrated when she tries rolling over and the dip makes it difficult...still possible, but difficult.-Changing Table- This thing can barely hold baby's weight. It's only supported on one side so it inevitably tilts towards the other. This is not only frustrating for you when trying to change the diaper, but kind of dangerous. I've tried using it a few times when LO was about 9 lbs, but in the end it was just too much hassle and very uncomfortable for the her.-Mobile- Comes with three cute little turtles, but it does not move. LO loves staring up at them, but when she is crying I have to turn them by hand to calm her down. Would really love it if it spins on its own.-Module- Not very loud, but it has 5 nature sounds and 5 different classical music. There is also a light on the top and side.Overall, this is an okay product. It works, but can definitely use some improvements.",3
"Safety 1st Grip N' Twist Door Knob Cover, 4-Count","We bought these to keep our 20 month old out of the pantry, but they DO NOT work.  He very quickly figured out how to defeat the cover, and can even take them off the doors if he wants! Buy another brand.  These are even worse than not having a cover, b/c you think you've protected everything and then *surprise!*, baby is somewhere he shouldn't be.",1
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","Super easy to install, or move around from window to window. Blocks major sun beam. Though would be nice if it blocked a bit more, overall we really like it that we bought another set.",4
Djeco / Flight Mobile,I tought the planes were real on wood or some material but they are in some hard paper. They still look ok,3
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","I was so excited to test this out after all the reviews of easy install. I am still searching reviews and you tube trying to figure out what I am doing wrong. The latch (lower anchors) keep getting in the way when I try to shut it. After much moving them around I was able to get it to click and the seat does not move an inch. I love that aspect, look, style,ect but I just feel I must not be the only person out there who has issues with the lower latches getting in the way of trying to snap it shut.",4
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx","We bought this as a second carseat, and ended up loving it so much we ditched the first seat we bought to buy a second. Easy to install, easy to wash cover and easy to adjust straps! It fits alright in my SUV, too. So simple for when my husband is deployed and I have to do adjustments myself. My daughter has been riding in it since she was about 7 months old, and I will never buy another brand of carseat after using this one! The headrest is great for holding her head/neck in place when she falls asleep in the car.",5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Crib 'N Go Projector Soother,Great at soothing and distracting my 5 month old.  The music is nice and mellow.  I also like that you can move it around.  I use it a lot so I can grab a shower while he plays in the pack in play in my room.,4
Travel Potty Chair,"I read the other reviews and decided to purchase this even though I didn't find any that pertained to travel.  This potty is perfect for all the travelling we do.  I have a 20 month old daughter, and wish I had bought this months ago.  She goes on her potty regularly at home, but when we travelled a few weeks ago the self flushing toilets scared her.  I had a seat that you sit on the large toilet for her to use, but she wouldn't get close to it after the auto flush incident.  I ordered this as soon as we got home, and it rocks!  It fits in my roller bag carry on with room to spare and is super light.  Since we live in Alaska I also have been carrying it in the car with us.  She used it today at the playground.  I'm sooo happy with this product.  One tip, I'm headed to spain and instead of using a bag everyday while we are at the villa I got a small bowl to slide under the potty so I can just empty that, it seems to work just fine.2-7-13 Update..... I still have this potty and am using it for my son!  Stil love it and am happy at how well it has held up! We have been using it for over two years with two different kids!",5
Columbia Baby Backpack With Ripstop Trim,"I ordered a backpack style diaper bag b/c my girlfriend recommended this versus an over the shoulder bag.  She was right.  This is great for keeping your hands free and I can use it with my Snugli.  I really like the small straps that allow you to hang it on the back of a stroller.  My only ""complaint"" is the inside big section does not have a divider or compartment.  I would have liked a section just for diapers so I don't have to dig around for them.  Otherwise, this is a great product so far (my baby is 8 weeks old now).",4
Fisher-Price SnugaMonkey Sleepytime Plush Baby Toy,"We got this for my son for Christmas 2012. He was 6 months old. Pretty much from the first day he loved it. He would quieten down and listen to it. As he got older he started hugging it in the night. Now he is obsessed. lol At almost 2, &#34;Snuga&#34; goes where he goes. I have to steal it to wash it. He loves to stroke the tail when he's tired. It must be relaxing to him. We love it. I really should get a back up in case something happens to his. He doesn't even really care about the musical part now. He loves it when it has batteries, but still cuddles it without them.",5
"Ciao! Baby Portable Travel High Chair, Black",It was intended as a gift. It opened securely and closed nicely.  All in all it was exactly what we purchased and we are delighted with it.,4

American Baby Company Celery Stripe 100% Cotton Percale Crib Sheet,material seems rougher and flimsy and thinner than a previous american baby company fitted sheet i had previously bought before,2
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,If you are looking to switch from a bottle to a sippy cup this is the one! The straw follows the liquid in the cup making it very easy for them to drink EVERYTHING in it. It does tend to leak if you fill it up too high though. Also why they put an open area at the bottom of the cup still baffles me. My son tends to mash stuff on his tray with the bottom of this cup and it can get stuck up in side that area.,4
Britax Child Cup Holder,"I like that this cup holder is deeper than the one that comes with our Safety First car seat. With that car seat, the cup will NOT stay in as it is too shallow to hold those tall sippy cups. The only negative to the Britax cup holder is that it doesn't come with the car seat. However, since it is actually functional, unlike the other one, I'll glad pay an extra $10-$15 for it.Also, I had no problems snapping it into place like other reviewers stated.",5
Lego Star Wars R2-D2 Keychain Figure,"very cool keychain,,, it's just a bit small, its just r2d2, it does not come with the additional lego emblem",4
"Bumkins Disney Baby Waterproof Super Bib, Princess, 6-24 Months, 2 Count","I have four kids.  We've done som pretty serious bib testing.  My favorite were the canvas bibs made by Ore/Sugarbooger, but they only make them in infant sizes now.  Which in my experience, is not actually a useful size for anything other than catching drool from teething or a little mess from a bottle feeding.  Anyhow, since I can't get those in useful size, I've tried just about every kind of bib.  So far, these are the best bibs I've found and the price is reasonable.There are other bibs that look similiar (such as the big-box store brands) but once you wash them in the laundry they turn into a wrinkly mess.  These bibs have survived many washings and still look good.  They do a decent job of catching food and they are nicely water proof.  My only complaint is that the velco tears off easy, so if your kid doesn't want to wear a bib, you are probably out of luck.  This is pretty much true of every bib out there these days, so unless get something handmade, it's just something you will have to work through.  Bumkins has a large enough selection that I've been generally been able to find designs that my kids like enough to tolerate.  Based on my experience this is the best bib for your money.",4
North States Supergate Auto-Close Metal Gate,"Self-closing, easy to install.  The lift up to open feature was irritating until we adjusted it to not lock in place which for those who are buying this for a toddler most likely defeats its purpose.  However, we purchased this to keep the family dog from going downstairs and it serves this purpose nicely.",5
"Munchkin Click Lock Re-usable Sippy Cups, 10 Ounce, 8-Count",Love that the cups and lids lock on and do not drip!  Excellent choice for my toddler granddaughter and grandson!,5
Tiny Love Symphony-in-Motion Remote Mobile,"1. Mobile stopped turning within 1 week of purchase.2. Mobile does not allow you to push it aside, as many other mobiles do.  This can make it more difficult to get your baby in and out of the crib.3. Mobile is not at all soothing - possibly what most people want - something soothing - in the crib area.  It is highly stimulating, which is not what I want my babies to have around them at bedtime.4. Mobile has clanky pieces (this is part of the design) that make a clanky, irritating noise while the mobile turns.Since it has broken anyway, we intend to return this mobile (hopefully will have no trouble) and get the Sassy developmental mobile instead (far and away better for the crib, in my opinion.)",1
"Foscam FBM3501 Digital Video Baby Monitor - 2.4 Ghz with Pan/Tilt, Nightvision and Two-Way Audio/Video Camera with 3.5-Inch LCD (White/Gray)","Better than most in this price range, and some a little more expensive. Clear picture, good audio. The 'push to talk' could be clearer but it does a good enough job. All in all, I would recommend this over other units and buy again in the future.",4
"3-D Bugs Large Pacifier (0+ months), Girl Design","I ordered these for my baby a couple of months ago.  She LOVES them, and they are all she will take now!  The little nubs around the base of the pacifier really help soothe her gums!  My order was perfect, and we received it FAST!  I was hoping to order some more, but they are out of stock.

Spongebob Squarepants Cuddle Pillow,"My sister bought this when the Spongebob fad was at ultimate hype. He eventually ended up on our basement table in a box lid, and the cats found him the perfect sleeping spot. We have 3, and all of them fight over him!

I definitely recommend this product. Great gift for the upcoming holidays too,",5

Alva Baby 6pcs Pack Fitted Pocket Cloth Diaper with 2 Inserts Each (Boy Color)6DM03,"After buying these I went to the web page I found it to be about $20 cheaper to buy directly from Alvababy. The downside though is they are shipped from China and can take up to 6 weeks. I'm happy I bought from Amazon because I got them in a couple of days.When my son grew out of his newborn g-diapers I transitioned him to these and I feel they are just as good as an expensive brand... But of course a lot cheaper. They are sometimes hard for me to put on him because I have rheumatoid arthritis, but I think they are a great product and I've never had a leak.",5

"Safety 1st Screen Door Saver, White","I live in a 3rd story apartment with really flimsy screens. I was looking for a way to be sure I could keep the windows open, but not have my cat fall out, run off, or fall victim to &#34;High Rise Syndrome.&#34;  Happy to say these do the job perfectly. I have them attached to the molding of a 31&#34; window, and used a small 30&#34;x2&#34; block of wood zip tied to the top so he can't get up an around.

Levana Additional Camera for Safe n'See,"After being unable to get the &#34;C1&#34; to toggle to a second camera &#34;C2,&#34; I contacted Levana (via Chat).  After some troubleshooting they told me I had an earlier version of the LV-TW501 and that early version does not support multiple cameras.  There was no version number on the back of the camera under the battery, so they asked me when/where it was purchased and then confirmed that my monitor would not work with multiple cameras.  I had purchased the monitor in 2011.",2
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash",I bought this walker a week ago for my 3 month old and he absolutely loves it! He has finally gained his independence and I now have time to get other things done.

Children Colorful Beads Plastic Abacus Math Training Educational Toy,"I was surprised by the size; I had pictured it about 8&#34; by 10&#34; like a child's wooden abacus. I probably didn't read the description closely enough.I was planning to use it to count swimming laps. I haven't tried it for that yet, but I am concerned that the beads may be too small to use quickly with cold or wet hands.This is very cute, as are all the little abacuses in different designs:  whale, etc.There is a &#34;times table&#34; printed on the back, as well as the place values to 10,000 (5 spindles) in Chinese characters.  Also what seem to be conversions to larger place values, which is mostly indecipherable to me, but lends a festive touch (really, I enjoy it).Low rating applies to the use that I planned to give it, counting swimming laps.",3
Moonlight Slumber Little Dreamer Dual Firmness All Foam Crib Mattress,We received this mattress a few days ago.  It fits prefectly in our crib - a snug fit but still moveable.

So far, he hasn't damaged it (in a month of use) nor has it damaged him!  And this little guy is tough.",5
Piyo Piyo Yellow Baby Nail Scissors,"I got these prior to packing my hospital bag for L&D, and am I glad I got these! My daughter was born with the longest nails and would have gauged her face if it were not for these handy scissors. They are easy to use, create a nice angle, and are very sharp. I cut my baby's nails when she is in deep sleep, and no accidents so far! Would highly recommend this item.",5

"Chicco KeyFit 30 Infant Car Seat, Midori","For the most part, I was happy with this car seat but find myself writing this review while I'm shopping for a different car seat for our second baby who will be joining us this fall.  We used the KeyFit 30 with a manufacture date of August 2010.  I don't know of any major changes since then, but perhaps some minor adjustments have been made.  Things I like about this car seat:  It is safe.  It seems to consistently get good safety ratings.  2) The fabric quality- it is nicer than many of the commonly available brands I've observed in its group of peers (Graco Snugride etc).  It is soft yet durable and seems ""sturdy.""  The fabric seems more like nice upholstery than plasticy fire-proof stuff. I feel this way about most Chicco products- they just seem well-built. 3) Ease of installation and use.  Once we had a certified tech show us how to do it, it was super easy to replicate installation to her level of expertise in no time.  Getting the baby in, adjusted, and out again is simple and easy.  Getting the seat in and out of the base never bothered me either.  4) Fabric colors/patterns: I liked them :)  As for comfort, I can't really comment as I personally exceed the 30 pound weight limit and my son was basically a terrible miserable mess in the car for the duration of his infant seat months.  It wasn't until he was a bit older that driving started being something I could do without white knuckles and an elevated blood pressure due to a screaming infant in the back seat.  Glad those days are over!  But I doubt that the seat contributed to his temperament.What I don't like about this car seat (and likely wouldn't like about the majority of its peer group (again, Graco etc) is it's size and WEIGHT.  I haven't come across parent who has actually used an infant seat up to 30 pounds.  Most transition to a convertible well before 20 pounds. The only advantage I could see to a 30 pound limit is if you have extremely large babies who gain weight faster than an average human baby, or if you want to keep the Keyfit for extended use as a spare/emergency car seat for an occasional baby sitter, 2nd vehicle etc.  But even then- once a kid starts sitting in a convertible, I'm guessing they won't be too thrilled about going back to the infant seat. Smaller seats (which are getting harder to find in the US market now) have a lower weight capacity and that is FINE with me! The seat we're looking at now is the Maxi Cosi Mico which has a 22 pound weight limit and weighs a mere 8 pounds vs. the KeyFit (Amazon lists the weight as 20 pounds, but I'm assuming that includes the base- the seat alone is not that heavy... I don't think). Our son was out of this by the time he was about 8 months old (but he was smaller than average.) I'm guessing most will have their babies into convertibles earlier as hauling much more than a 15 pound baby in this is a good way to make yourself miserable in a short amount of time.In addition to the weight, the size of this (and probably most other extended capacity seats) is big. I see this as a real disadvantage if/when you won't actually be needing that extended weight capacity (which, if you've read this far, you know I think that most parents won't).  We drove a Subaru Outback Sport (basically an Impreza) for the first several months of using this car seat.  The car was essentially converted to a 3 seater- the driver, the baby, and one passenger in the back seat.  The passenger seat had to be moved so far forward that it was rendered unusable by even my tiny 5 foot zero mother. We later added an Audi A4 wagon to the mix and again had to put the driver seat so far forward that it was nearly impossible to sit in and also blocked the driver's vision considerably. Granted, these are both small-ish cars and if you have a larger vehicle, this won't be an issue.  But if you fit into compact parking spaces, please please please do what we didn't do:  Try this car seat IN YOUR VEHICLE before you buy it and see if you can live with results for the next 6 or 7 months of your life.  A good retailer will let you do this.My final criticism is that it's not an ideal fit with the Baby Jogger City Mini stroller.  I know this isn't really a fault of the car seat, but thought I'd include this information as I would have liked to have known this prior to purchasing. It does work, and I did use it without any big problems for several months.  However, Baby Jogger's Chicco attachment bar isn't really tailored perfectly for the this car seat (I believe it fits a few other brands, perhaps it fits those better) and if you're a first time parent, you may be unnerved at how unstable this car seat seams on the stroller. The car seat basically rests on the attachment bar and must be strapped in with a nylon strap to be truly secure.  Otherwise it's pretty wobbly.  The car seat will not ""snap"" or ""lock"" into the attachment bar.  If Baby Jogger improves their Chicco adapter, this issue would disappear for me, but as far as I know, they haven't done so.So I suppose my bottom line is this: if you have a compelling reason to purchase a seat with a 30 pound weight capacity, the KeyFit 30 is among the best.  However, if I knew then what I know now, I would NOT see that 30 pound weight limit, which is often sold as a feature/benefit, to be a good thing.",4
"Neat Solutions 8 Pack Multi-Color Solid Knit Terry Feeder Bib, Girl","I liked it except the neck is too big. They should have made it short . They should have at least provided more options for making it fit for the baby. This can be used by adults, for babys it comes up to there chest. My baby is 8 months old",2
"Carters Velour Playard Fitted Sheet, Ecru","This is made of nice material. It's plush and soft and adds nice padding. The problem is that it's too elastic, so it makes my pack 'n play mattress fold up like an accordion. There's no way to get it to lay flat. It's also too big around the bottom of the mattress, so it interferes with the straps or velcro that hold the mattress in place. It was just ok when I used the bassinet attachment, because I could sort of bunch it up underneath and use the velcro to hold the mattress in place a little better. But it's impossible to use on the floor of the pack n play where I do not have anything to hold the mattress in place.",3
"OXO Tot Dishwasher Basket, Orange","As a child care provider, my wife is always running the dishwasher, and usually has to soak and hand wash several small items, like baby bottle nipples, sippy cup rubber stoppers, straws, etc.  She hand washes the small items due to the difficulty of fitting and securing them in the dishwasher.  Much to my wife's delight, I provided her the OXO Tot Dishwasher Basket to test for me.  She has declared that she may never have to hand wash all of those little parts again.The bottom basket (white) is large and open enough to hold sippy cup lids, silverware, bottle (nipple) rings, and the little cups that she uses to hold dry snack items for the children.  The upper part of the basket (orange) holds bottle nipples, sippy cup rubber stoppers, pacifiers, etc.  Straws are held securely in place on the sides.Overall we are extremely happy with this product.  I usually try to include pros and cons in my reviews, but we honestly have not come up with any cons for this product.  My only negative comment would be a question:  ""Why didn't they invent this product sooner?""  The price is great, the quality is excellent, and the overall design is as near perfection as you can get.  We have found so many uses for this great dishwasher basket, which are too many to name in this review.  This is a great product for every household that owns and uses a dishwasher, and is a must have for anyone with a baby and/or toddler.  Thanks OXO for making such a terrific and useful item.",5
Edushape Bongos Musical Toy,1. These are made of cardboard about the thickness of a cereal box and do not appear very durable.2. They do not sound like drums. They dont sound like much at all and are less entertaining than tupperware and a wooden spoon.3. There are no drumsticks in my package but I didn't expect any as they are bongos. You can get somewhat of a drum sound using something harder than your hand. I might make some mini sticks and see if my son likes these any better.4. The box states 3 and over and the item description states 1 and older.All in all I think these were a waste of money and would send them back but dont want to waste the gas. They were already shipped all the way from Israel. Surely we can make as bad a product here at home.I recommend buying something else or have fun making your own as they would be at least as good.,1
Baby Jogger City Select 2nd Seat Mounting Brackets,"I found these to be the cheapest deal with shipping on the web! They are usually 5-10$ more and we were trying to keep the cost down since there are so many pieces necessary to purchase for the Baby Jogger City Select. We haven't had our second baby yet but he's due any day now and when he's here we'll probably be using these adaptors all the time! Thanks for the great deal, I'm sure they will function the way they're intended.",5

"Britax Marathon 70 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","Our 28-inch six-month old grew out of his infant seat, so we needed to buy a larger car seat.  We purchased this car seat based on the glowing reviews.  I wish I would have also looked at reviews from other websites.  It is a great seat (installation was simple, it looks comfy and he can look out the window), except for the buckle between his legs is WAY TOO SHORT.  There is no way to lengthen it and he is sitting almost right on top of it when I put him in the seat.  Each time I buckle him in I have to make a concerted effort to avoid pinching his tights (which aren't even very chubby).We ordered the Boulevard and the strap between the legs is a couple of inches longer and works much better.",2
Summer Infant Rayshade Stroller Cover,Perfect for my Ignite First Years stroller! Fabric is not too flimsy as some have described and it adds the perfect amount of sun protection for my LO. It holds up to daily wind just fine and long as you make sure it is secured properly.,5
"J.I.P. Wooden Rocking Motor Wood, Motorcycle","I ordered the item as a gift and didn't open the packaging; instead I gave the package to my nephew and let him open it up. The package of the product itself was torn up and it looked like someone had already put together the fire engine because it had glue marks on it. The wood was ruined/had dents/scratches on it, and some of it was discolored a yellow-brown color because of the previous use of glue. The seat of the product is really small and the ""fire engine"" part of it is narrower than I expected. I regret presenting it before attempting to put it together because I can't necessarily take a gift away from a child. Now I'm just concerned whether it is the safest thing to give him (the front handles did not set in correctly either)--on top of that it is not very aesthetically pleasing because it arrived already worn out. I probably would have returned it too if my nephew hadn't opened it himself.",1
"Manhattan Toy Snuggle Pod, Peanut","We nicknamed out son ""peanut"" since he was so small when he was born and I hit the jackpot with this toy! Like the other reviewer said- I don't understand why this isn't popular either! It is adorable!!! Very soft, very ""huggable"", love the taggies for the hair and the satin pieces on the clothing for a tactile difference. My son loves him too! The Peanut Doll is primary colors- perfect for a boy. Just a side note- the doll does not have legs- it is more like the peanut shape (like it has a bunting suit on). Dolls are great toys for young children (and babies) since it aids emotional development and this toy is perfect for that job! I very highly recommend it- you will not be disappointed!!!",5
"Skip Hop Giraffe Safari Twist and Smile Toy, Crocodile","I selected this from ""Vine"" on Wednesday, it came on Friday, I gave it to my little grand daughters (5 and 3) on Saturday and they immediately named it ""Cro-colina"" on Saturday; not bad for a cuddly little fella' made of soft fabric, about 10 - 12 inches long whose tail and tummy and chest twist, turn and who chimes when you shake him. Smiles all around.",5

JJ Cole Infant Body Support - Graphite,"I went to Babies R Us to try out different head supports before this baby gets here and this one was much better than the other ones. I put my 16 month old in the seat to tighten the harness straps and everything. I put the snuzzler in first and it didn't fit quite right in the Snugride 32 we're getting. I tested out the regular ""rainbow"" ones and I just hated those with my other 2 girls. I tried out this one and I loved it. There's not any more fabric behind the baby than there is with the rainbow supports, unlike the snuzzler I tried out. I was able to get the harness tightened to my liking with this one, again unlike the snuzzler. The only thing I like about the snuzzler is that it comes up higher on the baby's head, but I would rather have my harness straps tightened properly. The higher support might make the new baby mad anyway when she get's older and can't see as well with it on her head.The JJ Cole one is better by far!",5
Blue Jean Teddy Mobile,"I bought everything Blue Jean Teddy for the &quot;perfect&quot; nursery, including the mobile.  We used it for about 2 weeks.My son slept in a cradle in our room while I was breastfeeding.  The mobile was too big for the cradle (any mobile would have been) and got in the way of putting him in, or taking him out, so we took it down.  As soon as he outgrew his cradle and was in his crib, we put it back up.  He did love it, but only about 2-3 weeks after he was in his crib full time, he started standing.  As soon as he started standing, we took it down per the manufacturers recommendations as it was unsafe to have it in there if he could reach it.For what it cost, and for the amount of time we actually used it, the mobile was a waste of money for us.If you get a lot of use from it, it will be a nice addition to your nursery, and our son did enjoy it.  Unfortunately, it wasn't the best choice for us because of our situation.I do not recommend using it with a cradle as it takes up too much space and got in the way.",3

The Bundle Me makes it so easy get baby ready to go, instead of having to put a coat on her, etc. I get many compliments on it, and am glad that I spent the extra money on this version, the material is so soft & warm, and it's great quality.Now instead of getting my daughter new coats to fit her, (and to match her wardrobe!) I have the Bundle Me ready to go, already in the carseat! I would definately recommend this item, and would proudly purchase it as a gift for anyone having a baby in the wintertime!",5
Postpartum Support Girdle Belt w/zipper Support Belly Band Medical-Grade Compression Bellefit,"I had a c-section and although it took me about a week after delivering before I could use this, I felt it really did help my incision. It kept it supported so I could go on about my day relatively pain-free. The support kept the area from jostling around while taking care of a newborn. I also look more smoothed out in my clothing thanks to this, which helps me feel more confident in my new body.The stays on the side do poke into me a bit. Not due to the size but due to the fabric that covers them. I have gotten used to it, but at first I would get red marks from the seams. Ouch!",4
Alva Baby AI2 Print Reuseable Washable Pocket Cloth Diaper Nappy + 2 Inserts S31,"These diapers were a little bit more than on Alva Baby's website, but because Amazon offers free shipping, ordering through Amazon is the better value.I am a huge fan of BumGenius, but they are a bit out of my price range. After talking to a friend, she recommended Alva. I didn't have a lot of hope since the price was cheap and I read some other reviews saying the quality was lacking. However, I am in love with these diapers and will not be buying BG anymore! There are a ton of different colors and patterns, they are half the price of BG, and the quality is fantastic. I will definitely be ordering more Alva diapers in the future.",5
"Pipila Portable Pacifier Sterilizer, Red","I push down the button and the little light comes on.  That means it's working, right?  Well, I can't honestly be sure because there is no way to test whether the pacifier is steralized or not.  What I do know, however, is steralization does not equal clean.  A dirty pacifier can be put in this gizmo and come out just as dirty.  So if there is dried milk or anything else on the pacifier, clean it first.Regarding the steralizer's construction, it appears fairly simplistic, maybe even cheap.  Plastic parts that just scream ""easily broken"" appear to constitute the entire device, but I could be wrong because I'm not going to waste time reverse engineering it.It's peace of mind, nothing more.",3
9-piece Fruit Basket Set (Soft),"I just bought these and paid the $12 or so not realizing I could have purchased this item and others like it in person for $7.99 at IKEA.

USC Trojans Infant Onesie 0 - 3 Months Pink,"I ordered this for my 3 month-old baby, and was sadly disappointed because it was sized 0-3 (TALL) - the tall aspect makes it way too big for my baby to wear this season, and will be too small to wear next season. Overall, this was a waste of money because it didn't come in 0-3 month standard size, if they had indicated it would be ""tall"" I would never have ordered it. I feel cheated.",2

PackIt Double Baby Bottle Bag - Blue Dot,"For baby bottles on the go in a warm climate, this cooler seemed perfect. The design of the bag and the insulated walls are great. But, after a few months of using it, the velcro does not hold shut whatsoever. It just flops open, even if I press down carefully and &#34;seal&#34; it. There are no pieces of fuzz or string keeping the velcro from doing its job, it just doesn't stick. I've never seen velcro that fails like this. I've contacted customer service, and they asked me to send a picture of the defective velcro (not sure how you could tell from a picture, but I did it anyway, assuming it was just part of their protocol). I never heard back from them. It's unfortunate because the bags are cute and useful as coolers, but I pretty much just have to put it in another bag because it will not stay shut. Now that my baby is eating snack foods, it means that string cheese, fruit, and whatever else we are packing inside is going to spill out. Disappointing.",3
"Sorelle Vista Couture Crib, Espresso","This is a very nice crib.  I am a grandmother and needed a crib at my house. It was VERY easy to put together, much easier than my daughter's.  so now I'm waiting to see how it handles the 9 month old's teeth.  She has already begun chewing.",5

Badger SPF30 Sunscreen (2.9 oz) and Badger SPF 35 Sport Sunscreen Face Stick (.65 oz),In love with this sunscreen...great price for the bundle and the stick is awesome for little faces!

"Fisher-Price Portable Rocker, Newborn-to-Toddler",From the pics and description it look and sound good. There are a few things wrong with this product. One which I find highly dangerous for infants is if baby pushes off on their legs they will hit their head on the metal frame. It is right above babies head! The frame need to be beneath baby.  My child is three months he pushes his legs on the seat and screams it delight to the toys but next thing you hear is crying. Second it can convert to toddler seat but I do not see how a child can be comfortable. Again the seat part goes back but metal frame will prevent child from leaning back into the seat. You see the pic where baby is sleeping and is sunken into the seat? In upright it like that too just not that deep. There are at most three inches above my three month olds head so no way a toddler will fit.,1
Knit Double Headrest - Navy,"I am unsure if every new mom and dad need this item. We got one, thinking it was a must have. Our son used it for one month. The car seat that we got(graco sugride) came with a headrest that would have been fine. He has outgrown the smaller part of this headrest it at 8lbs and 21 inches. It might be nice to get, then see the size of your newborn. That way, you could return it if your child does not need it. I can see where it would be a must have for a preemie.",3
"Sunshine Kids Radian80 SL Convertible Car Seat, Primrose","This seat may get great reviews for safety but at the cost of comfort for your child, ease of daily use for the parent and the hassle of a really hard clean.  The forward facing seat does not recline enough to create anything other than a 90 degree angle which is extremely uncomfortable for my child.  The seatbelt (points 3 & 4 of the 5 point harness) are always slipping under the child so parent has to dig them out every single time.  Cleaning is horrific.  What type of planning when into the mesh seat cushion of the radian 80SL Sport? Not the parent of a messy toddler.  I've had this seat for two months and hate it.  What a waste of a lot of money.",1
Snuza Hero Baby Movement Monitor,"So my 6-month old face-plants when she sleeps - scary stuff.  And I mean face into the mattress . . .  My wife and I bought this for some piece of mind and so that we could actually go to bed without having to stare at her all night.  It's a fairly good product (seems over priced for the small/simple mechanism), but in the first month, we have had about 1-2 false alarms per week and I can't nail down the cause.  I might still recommend it, but you have to be prepared to be woken up with a false alarm here and there.",4
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","We love this, we keep it on the changing pad all the time (and use a pre-fold diaper on top to protect it from messes!)",5
"Britax Pioneer 70 Harness-2-Booster Car Seat, Kiwi",Love this Britax seat for my daughter.  Easy install and fits great in my Camry.  The seat slightly reclines so it makes longer trips more comfortable for my daughter. Was easy to adjust the height of the shoulder straps to fit her properly.,5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I like having this to visit with friends who don't have a high chair for my daughter.  It folds up pretty small and I usually keep it in the trunk of my car, to save myself from having to hold a wiggly baby in my lap and try to eat myself at the same time while feeding her.  Clean up is a snap, and I love the tray cover to keep it relatively clean while floating around in my trunk.  The only bad thing is that it's rather small, and my 1 and a half year old barely fits in it anymore, so it's only useful for a short time.",4
"Kids Line Jungle 123 Canvas Wall Art 3 Piece, Brown",I'm very happy with this product!  The three pictures look exactly as expected and seem to be a good quality.  Looks great in the nursery!,5
"Bummis TotsBots Easy Fit Hook &amp; Loop Cloth Diaper Shell, Chicken Little, One Size 8-35 lbs","I came late to the V3 Easy Fit love, so it's been a challenge to locate diapers to add to our stash, but they're worth seeking out. The fit of these diapers is very trim and the aplix on Tots Bots/Bummis diapers is like no other (although I think there are a couple brands like Miosolo that are taking note and using similar heavy duty aplix on their diapers). I like the flexibility with these diapers. The soaker can either be stuffed into the pocket or just folded over, and additional boosters can be stuffed into the pocket or under the soaker. I started out stuffing everything, but now I just layer them. Some say everything will agitate out in the washer, but that's never been my experience. I wish I would have discovered these sooner. They are great diapers.",5
Pressure Gate Wall Saver - Two Pack,The gate is just what I wanted; I really like the gate. It is well made - very sturdy. I would recommend this gate for children or dogs (medium and small.),5

Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"I've bought several different kinds of spoons for feeding my baby. Some were too wide for her mouth; others were too uncomfortable for my hand. These spoons are great! The handle is really comfortable for me. The spoon is a good width and depth for her six-month-old appetite. I wouldn't recommend these for baby's first meals, but I can see that they're going to remain just right for a long time to come.And the colors?! Awesome!",5
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","These blankets are so useful! The fabric is lightweight and breathable. They are flimsy enough to throw in the diaper bag without taking up too much room. They work great for swaddling and in a pinch they work as a burp cloth! Ha! They're very soft and I really like the colorful designs. U can get some at Target, but I really like the patterns I got thru amazon",5
Sassy Deluxe Seat Positioner,"This is a great product because it can be used in so many ways. The baby can sit on it or it can be used while he or she is on his or her back. It is also good for tummy time. The colors are very bright, which is very good for kids. My kids enjoyed the toys on it, and that helped keep them entertained. It's nice to buy one product and have it serve to many purposes and work in conjunction. Of course, like with all baby toys, this is not meant to leave the baby on - you still have to watch the baby.",5
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss Toddler Fork And Spoon Flatware, Colors May Vary",I love these take and toss spoons. I keep them in my diaper bag. I'm such a hoarder though that I actually keep them and wash them in the dishwasher. They do great!,5
SugarBooger Fairies and Berries Jumbo Splat Mat,I'm really happy with this mat. Fits nicely under my girl's play table. Nice quality.,5
Elegant Baby Plush Microfiber Blankie - Pastel Blue,"I got this to replace my daughters blankie, wasn't sure if it would work because of the size(smaller). Looked for a year to find one that matched this same style but larger and was disappointed to only find ones that were over $50. So when we received this in the mail and I gave it to my five yr old, she was thriled. She has been so Happy with this product. Thank you makes bed time so much better for the both of us :-)",5
"Britax Marathon Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","While I hesitated with the price, I now realized it lived up to its reviews.  It was so simple to install, I over complicated it.  I assumed it would be as difficult as the other pricey car seat we bought for my son.  easy to install, comfy and will grow.only downside- we have a Jetta Wagon, It makes the seats in front have to move very close to dash when in rear position.  But, worth the money anyway",5
Jolly Jumper Sneak a Peek Sneak-a-Peek Infant Carseat Cover Deluxe - Black,Its great for the new baby on the go MoM. Gave it as a giftfor Grandchild.,5
21 mm One-Piece Breastshield w/ Valve and Membrane for Medela Breast Pumps; Replace Medela 21 mm Personal Fit Breast Shield and Connector; Made by Maymom,"The product was exactly what was expected, but unfortunately was still way too large and unusable for my nipples. I never could find any flanges that were small enough to fit properly, but luckily I was able to pass this on to a sister in law and it fit her perfectly and made a world of difference in her pumping. Glad I tested the size on this before using it so I could confidently pass it on to her. She said cleaning and use was a breeze.",5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","depends on  how much breast milk you have, it just leaks. i wish the one side of surface was vinyl or something to prevent from the leaking.this is just thick clothe to me.",3
Mommy's Helper Safe-er-Grip Foot Rest,"I was desperate for something to help me shave my legs in the shower stall we have.  I'd tried one kind that was attached with silicone and it wouldn't stay on.  The reviews for this product were about 50/50--it worked for some but not for others. I decided to give it a try.  It works great for me!  We have regular, glossy bathroom tile.  If your tile is textured or smaller than the normal size, it probably won't work for you.  I find the product to be very sturdy.  One thing I couldn't tell from the picture is that entire back of the thing is a thick slab of white rubber.  It makes for a powerful suction cup.  The suction cup is created or released by the lever under the platform.EDITED TO ADD:  The suction cup does some times come off unexpectedly.  I have learned how to tell when this is about to happen.  When the foot rest is first placed on the tile wall, you cannot see the white suction cup.  All you see is the plastic.  But after a few weeks, when I put my foot on the foot rest, I can see it pull away a bit.  That's the warning sign that it WILL come off soon.  So about once a month, I take it off and let it dry and put it back on.  Works like a charm.",5
"Graco Ready2Grow Classic Connect LX Stroller, Metropolis","I read a lot of reviews on doubles, because I was afraid of having to drive a limo around with two kids in it.  However, this one really fits the bill.  A lot of reviewers said it's just a beast, and that it's too big.  Well, let me tell you something.  It's made to hold two kids, it's a double stroller.  It's going to be a beast.  But, it's not THAT much bigger than a single stroller, so I'm pleased.  Also, yeah, folded up, it's pretty big.  Again, I'm not sure what else you would expect from a double stroller, unless you get a side by side umbrella.  It folds one-handed, and (this one's a biggie) it STEERS one-handed! I was expecting something like those stupid car carts at the grocery store, you know, the ones that you have to make 5-point turns with?  No, this drives like a dream.  I also love that I can put my kinds in it some many different ways.  I have an almost 2 year old and a baby coming in July.  The 2 year old fits just fine in the front with the car seat in the back, or he can even sit in the jump seat while the car seat sits in the front.  It's wonderful.  I love this thing, and it's exactly what I was looking for in a double stroller!  Highly recommend!",5
"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt",It is a sturdy reusable bag that I take with me every time I go grocery shopping. It saves on getting all those plastic bags that you don't want and you can put a lot more in them too.,5
"Dreambaby Stroller Fan, White/Blue","This product is cheaply made and is the clip is clunky.  I'm sure it will work for our purposes (keeping our little guy cool in the back seat), but I wish there was a better alternative.",2
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"I cannot rave about this product enough - it has been an absolute lifesaver!  I LOVE that it serves dually as a trainer seat on a large potty OR a stand-alone mini-potty.It folds fairly flat, so it's easy to fit in a diaper bag (or even a large tote-style purse).  It's awesome when on-the-go (whether long car rides when you just need to pull over for a sudden need to potty break, or at a fair/carnival setting when port-o-potties are the only other option - and who wants to put a little kid through that?).  It's also great even for vacations or going to other's houses.  My daughter is very petite, and cannot sit on a regular-sized toilet or she will fall in.  We bring this everywhere with us.1000% worth every penny.  I would recommend this to everyone.",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sounds Full Color Video and Audio Monitor,Was a pretty good monitor but only lasted about a year before it crapped out and was no longer usable.,2
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock n' Play Sleeper, Yellow","A month ago I had my fourth child and we got this from a friend.  For my other children we used bassinets or had them spend significant time in the swing (we have a pretty nice sideways moving swing).  I am so glad we have this and I wish we had gotten it earlier.  We never use our swing or crib, it seems like, because this little device is so convenient.1. It is super lightweight and easy to pick up, even if the baby is in it.  We can put her to sleep in it in one room and then move her while she sleeps very easily.2. This holds her a little bit upright.  As a result we have had very little throwing up or acid reflux with this baby.  It's hard to compare children because each one is different, but this baby has been sleeping MUCH better than the others did.  Personally I think this sleeper is a major contributor.3. You can easily rock this just a little bit, which is what babies want.  Typically if I'm doing something else I put my foot on the little bar at the bottom and give her really gentle rocking if she is fussy.4. Because the bottom is basically cloth, it doesn't get too hot.  Our baby has been quite comfortable in it.5. It folds up easily.  We don't typically do that because it's pretty small and because we use it so very often.6. Very simple design.  The cloth comes off pretty easily to be cleaned.We don't use the vibration feature.  If our baby needed more rocking than we can easily provide in this, we'd move her into the swing.Our swing is pretty nice and we have a nice crib for her, but this is what we always use.  You can set it next to your bed to get to her quickly, or move her out into the hall if you want to be able to hear her crying but not every little sound she makes in her sleep.We really love this product.  It kind of makes all the other things we have purchased obsolete.  There are probably other models with about the same design that don't have vibration built in that would be equally good, though.  We got this for free.  Though we love it, I'm a little disappointed by how much it costs new.",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,I would recommend this baby monitor.  The price is great for what you get.  The camera unit & monitor are both very easy to set up.  There are so many angles & options to set up the camera unit so you'll see exactly what you want.  You can even mount the camera unit up high on a wall to get away from the crib and the picture is very clear still.  The screen on the monitor is very large & clear.  The options of auto-mute for times of silence & inactivity are easy to set up.  The infrared works great.  Great baby monitor!,5
Disney Cars Folding Potty Seat,"Convenient for traveling. Fits well on most toilets we have tried but if it's a smaller toilet seat, we had trouble with it sliding to one side (which has only happened on one seat).",4
Britax Frontier Booster Car Seat,"I read lots of reviews, both positive and negative, before buying this carseat.  I am extremely happy with it and so is my 3.5-year-old who uses it. Despite many online reviews saying it is hard to install, I have to say I find it incredibly easy to install and to remove.  (I have a Subaru Outback and have used it also in a Kia minivan and a Nissan Maxima so far. Also, have only used it with Latch so far, not with the seat belt.) I read online tips about being able to tighten it through holes in the seat, and that ability makes installation a breeze. True, it's not very light - I would not want to take it on a plane trip - but that's the only drawback to moving it.  It also looks nice, feels very sturdy, and is comfortable.  I will be purchasing a second.",5
"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane","I chose this car seat based on its reviews online as well as from fellow moms.  Overall, this car seat is great.  My boys are currently 16 months old, and really enjoy going on car rides.  My husband has to travel to the airport several times a month, and we only have one vehicle, so we are always going with, and the trip is about an hour away.  The boys really enjoy taking car rides, and don't mind the lengthy travel.  They also nap very well in them, too.  My only complaint is that I had a real problem installing as rear facing, which was the main reason I bought the seats.  We have a 2011 Jeep Patriot, which is a smaller SUV, but the car seats wouldn't stay stable in a rear facing position.  They wobbled easily, and it was unsafe looking.  Luckily, my boys were close to 30 lbs when I purchased these car seats (just near 13 months old then) so it was okay for them weight-wise to be front facing.  They seem to enjoy riding forward facing more anyways - they can see my husband and myself, and it makes it a lot easier to tend to them if they need water, toys, or snacks.  Overall, we really enjoy this car seat.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I love this product because you can use REGULAR TRASH BAGS and you do not need to order ""refill bags"" to keep this unit operational!  It's easy to use, blocks all odors, and once you pay for the unit, there are no additional bags to buy...which saves you money in the long run!",5
Philips AVENT Express Food and Bottle Warmer,"These work great. this is the second one I have purchased at such a great price. Two Grand daughter, Two Great granddaughter. these little warmers are a great for a new mother to have. Works great and is wounderful.",5
"Safety 1st Chart 65 Air Convertible Car Seat, Yardley","I ordered this car seat for my son, and was pleasantly and unpleasantly surprised.I was very happy about the quality of the seat, the fabric is nice and my son loves it. BUT, when I received the box it was half opened, and there's nothing protecting it besides the flimsy (opened) box. I have bought other seats, and this one is by far the worst packaged one I've seen! I mean, how hard would it have been to wrap the seat in plastic, or something along those lines?? It was damp, and like I mentioned before- the top open. The cup holder was just thrown into the box, not wrapped or anything either.Besides the packaging, the seat really is wonderful. It's so much safer then what we had. Just annoyed over the packaging....",5
"Lansinoh mOmma Bottle with NaturalWave Nipple, 8 Ounce",What can I say-if my baby won;t like it I don't like it either. She is a boob lover and so far nothing worked better when mommy is not there is Comomoto bottle with big soft boob like nipple.,2
Annabel Karmel Masher and Bowl,"I got this for my 7 month old daughter. Up till this point I used a hand blender to puree her foods,(she wont eat jarred baby food and I don't blame her....Yuk!), but she is getting big enough to handle chunkier textures. Also I am getting ready to fly cross country with my little one and thought that this is compact enough to put in my suitcase. It is perfect for mashing veggies to an even consistency, but still keeps the texture. The ribbing in the bottom of the bowl is ingenious, and the silicone on the handles allows for easy grip. Love that it is dishwasher and microwave safe, and very easy to use. Perfect for mashing by the meal. I recommend this for sure, as a travel companion or to make single meals. It is not practical for making large quantities at a time to freeze though.",5
Black Diaper Bag,"With our two young children, ages 11 months and 22 months, getting out of the house was pretty difficult.  One constant source of aggravation was trying to carry the baby, hold the toddler's hand, and juggle my purse and diaper bag which were always falling off my shoulder.This bag has so many wonderful features.  Here's what we love:1. Love that it slings across my back.  No more diaper bag falling off my shoulder.2. Great that my hands are free!3. Distrubutes the weight so that I don't even feel it at all.4. Love, Love, Love the insulated bottle holder on the side.  Awesome feature!5. The changing pad has it's own little pocket on the back of the bag- easily accessible but out of the way.6. Many compartments!  We use the very bottom compartment to hold a case of wipes, four diapers and a tube of diaper cream.  The middle size front compartment is the perfect size for my wallet, lipstick, pen and check book.  The small front compartment holds my cough drops and has room for plenty more.  The large side compartment has two small inner compartments and then a really large space.  We pack snacks, toys, change of clothes, etc. in there.  And, after all this, there is still room to spare.  Outer mesh pocket on the side is perfect for toddler's sippy cup or a bottle of water for me.7. Great having the cell phone on the outer strap.  At first I thought this was kind of goofy, but it really is very convenient.Overall, this bag is wonderful.  This is the 8th or 9th diaper bag that I've tried and the only one that I haven't returned.  I wish I had found it sooner.  For a smaller bag, it has all the space and convience of a larger bag without the weight.  I can't recommend it highly enough!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"My son loves this! We got it when he was 4 months old and by the second time in it, he was bouncing like crazy! Easy to put together (I did it myself) with a very sturdy base. He'll jump around and play with the toys for 30+ min. Best purchase!!",5
Safety 1st Secure Close Handle Lock,I gave this product two stars because it does work to keep my daughter out of our cabinet but it is a pain to get the cabinet open when you want to get into it.  You have to take the entire contraption off the cabinet to get inside it.,2
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Burpy Bib, Butterfly Patch","This is the best for my drooling/teething baby! Keeps him dry all day and can be taken off and thrown over my shoulder for a burp cloth after eating. It is literally perfect for my baby. Especially great that it fits over his fat neck, unlike other bibs!",5
Nature's Purest Sleepy Safari 4-Piece Crib Set,"I love this crib bedding. It's amazingly soft and the designs are adorable and relaxing, which is what you want in a crib. The only thing I don't love about it is that there are two stuffed flowers on the bumper that are attached by a string and I'm afraid my baby will be able to pull off the whole bumper. I've cut them off and she likes to chew on them instead. Otherwise, we're very happy with this product!",5
"Swaddlebees Newborn Simplex All In One Diapers, Giraffe",So cute and practicable.,5
Summer Infant By Your Side Sleeper Portable Bedding,"My son won't sleep flat on his back, so didn't work for us.  Otherwise it's a great and safe option for co-sleeping.  It is large, so fit well in our king size bed, but if two people and this in a smaller bed, might not work.",4
"Baby Doll Bedding Heavenly Soft Adult Rocking Chair Cushion Pad Set, Pink","I purchased this chair cushion set and though the color was cute and the fabric comfy, I would not purchase this product again. There is really no thickness if you need to sit for longer than 20 minutes. I would only purchase again if the price was significantly reduced and was used for mostly decoration. In fact, I had to order a different cushion in order to comfortably rock.",2
Evenflo Soft N Wide Gate,"This is a nice product, just not a gate! It sturdy & good if you want to put it in a hallway/passage where you can easily step over it, but not at the bottom of the stairs (like I wanted to) as its dangerous to have to step over. Also, is not suitable for top of stairs...",2
KidCo Electrical Outlet Cap- 12 pk,"Any type of these work well, really. I've yet to see either of my children pick them off. Though they are kind of hard to get off yourself when you get to get to the outlet.",5
Kimberly Grant Bohemian Butterfly Wall Decals,"Just bought these things to hang on our new baby's wall in her nursery.  Thought they would be a cute addition, but really they are a hazard.  They did not stick to the wall.  I called the company and the woman stated it may be the type of paint I have on my walls but she (surprisingly) could not remember the name of the paint these things don't stick to.  My guess it's most paints.  My biggest issue with these would be the potential hazard.  They are plastic sheets, essentially, that fall off of the wall and around a new baby.  You hang these things in the wrong spot, they fall, land on your baby and obstruct his or her breathing, or they somehow try to eat this product?  Awful.  I would really hate for this to happen to anyone.",1
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"I am honestly not a straw cup fan... I have 3 kids and my older boys just did not do well with them at all! I had full intentions on avoiding them on baby number 3, but when I recived it in my package from petite lemon I figured well it's here I should give it a try.  I watched in amazment as he sucked down the entired cup with ease!!!I still am not the biggest fan due to cleaning but these I at least don't dread.My only issue it the price I kinda wish they were a bit cheaper but since they work so well they are at least worth getting one maybe two.",4
Bumkins Organic Cotton Everyday Bib 3-Pack - Sage,These Bumkins all cotton bibs are the best!!..... REALLY!They are just the right thickness....very absorbent....quality made and look cute...not gaudy like most baby bibs.  They are perfect for when baby is teething as they are not petroleum based fabric and they can chew on them to soothe their gums while at the same time absorbing the drool!  Love them!!,5
"Neat Solutions 5 Pack Graphic Print Interlock Feeder Bib, Boy","We have a very ""spitty"" baby and go through dozens of bibs per week as she spits up on 1-4 of them per feeding!  These bibs are our absolute favorites.  They are big enough to really cover her shirt so that we don't have to change her outfit after each feeding, they are absorbent so that the spit-up usually doesn't spill down and off the bib and onto us, the floor and her pants, and the velcro works great (unlike some popular bibs we own with terrible velcro).  I bought these for $12 at a baby boutique and am excited to see them much cheaper on Amazon.",5
"Graco FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Travel System/Click Connect 35, Chili Red",I found the stroller to be cheaper than all the department stores.  It will be convenient when the baby is born because I can jog with the baby.,5
"Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White",Love all the different designs.  Perfect boppy and cover design for little girl.  Great gift for new moms as well!,5
Lite-on-Shoulder Baby Sling,"This is the best baby carrier I have tried and I've tried a front carrier, moby wrap, and pocket sling. I love the infinite adjustablity of he ring sling. My LO is quite the squirmer, so it is great to get her in place before cinching it down. The padded rails are great, and it really is light on the shoulder! Carrying my 20lb baby in my arms cramps up my bicep in a pair of minutes, but i barely feel her weight in this. It is a wonderful sling and so affordable! I would not only recommend this to all of my friends, but it for my friends if I could!",5
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"Okay, I realize that I am putting up a review on a potty seat. Never thought I'd do that but here I am.This is an awesome product. My girls (4.5 and 2.5) love using it when we are out and about because it doesn't move around once it's places on a toilet. I had another foldable potty seat that I used to carry around and I have now chucked it. This one is small enough to be carried in my diaper bag and I like that it comes with a pouch. It's easy to wipe clean and has nice handles they can hold on to while they are using it. All in all, very happy with this purchase and I will definitely be recommending it to other friends.",5
White Knob Lock - 2 Pieces,"These door knob locks are only ok.  They are kind of flimsy and the doors are still pretty easy to open with them on which is ok right now since my son is only 2.5 and his hand isn't big enough to fit around the knob.  Once he grows a little bit more, they won't work for us.  I have one on a utility closet and he hasn't been able to open it yet.  They were easy to install and do give me peace of mind.",3

"C.R. Gibson Loose-Leaf Memory Book, Classic Pooh","The book was a little flimsy and the binder clips didn't seem reliable; at least not something that would hold up for long. When the item arrived, some of the pages were not in the three-ring binder all the way and were coming out of the book. There was noticeable glue residue from the little white rectangle decoration on the front of the page. With this purchase, I realized that you get what you pay for, and when it comes to documenting the life of a new baby, I recommend spending more money and getting something of high quality from an actual store that carries nice baby books. This is not something I would buy for a friend again and would never buy for my own baby.",2
"Boppy Newborn Lounger, Geo","The Boppy Newborn Lounger was a lifesaver for us! We bought the Newborn Lounger after 1 week home from the hospital. We were looking for a product to place our child where she could snuggle in and feel safe and secure. I loved that it is portable and lightweight, making it very easy to move from room to room. It is easy to spot clean to remove formula and it still looks new. We mainly used it in out living room so we didn't have to drag the bassinet around. We used the Boppy Newborn Lounger for our baby's 1st 5 months and I would highly recommend it to any new parents!",5
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Pink","We bought this for our 9 month old daughter so when we go out to eat, she has a clean surface that she can eat off of, and we hoped it would contain some of the mess and make cleanup easier when she was done.Overall, we like this product, but the biggest complaint we have is the built in suction cups. They don't stay stuck to the table. We haven't eaten at a table yet that has a perfectly smooth surface, and the suction cups keep coming off the table. Also, the cups themselves aren't like your typical suction cups. They are thicker and they just don't seem to hold well, even on a smooth surface. The mat still stays in place though, even if the suction cups aren't stuck down.The product works overall. It is better then not having anything, but it wasn't quite what we expected. It may have been better if it was a little bit thicker and would just lay flat on its own.On the positive side. It is very convenient to travel with because it rolls up into itself. It is also very easy to clean. We haven't been able to figure out if it is dishwasher safe yet, but hand washing it is easy because nothing seems to stick to it. Also, it covers a large enough area of the table you don't really have to worry about food getting on the table.There are some flaws, mainly with the suction cups, but this is a good product overall.",3
Sock Ons Clever Little Things That Keep Baby Socks On! 3 Pack Neutrals 0 - 6 Months,These little things are so clever! They work well and don't seem to bother my child at all.  They keep their 'shape' and have worked and worn well for the past 2 months.  I would definitely buy again and recommend this product to anyone that has arrived at day care to pick up a child missing one sock...or two!,5
"KidCo Safeway Safety Gate, White","I purchased both the KidCo safety gate as well as the Munchkin gate http://www.amazon.com/Munchkin-Extending-Metal-Gate-White/dp/B004CLBX8G/ref=sr_1_12?s=baby-products&ie;=UTF8&qid;=1400550753&sr;=1-12&keywords;=baby+gateBoth of these were installed on stairways and both had custom installations performed.  The Munckin gate had only a very slight change done.  I was putting this in a stairway that was framed.  The included screws are not sufficient to go through the drywall and into the wood beam enough to adequately hold via the beams.  So I purchased longer screws.The KidCo gate, which is recommended by the baby bargains book, is very similar.  I installed this on an upstairs staircase where the hinge side is with the wood bannister.  My bannister does not have a flat face and the space from the bannister to the first wood piece is very narrow, so I purchased a steel bar from Home Depot and created a compression mount.  The top has wood cut around the banister holding with compression.  Finally there is a steel bar between these two pieces in which the gate is mounted.  On the catch side, I had a molding problem, so I screwed a piece of wood to the wall with wood offset's in the back.The gates are pretty similar.  The catches operate completely different so it's possible one would have a preference of one vs the other based up this feature.  I have the gate set to open only in a single direction and this works great on the Munchkin.  This feature is not well designed on the KidCo and I noticed today that I had closed the gate past the stop.  So if you care about the safety stop, then I would pass this gate up for a better gate.  The steel construction of both gates seems to be similar.Either way, you will be buying a good gate for your child.",4
Britax Back Seat Mirror,"I love this backseat mirror for how sturdy and large it is. We had a different one that was very flimsy and had to be balanced in just the right position, and anytime anyone happened to bump it, it was out of alignment immediately. This one is the opposite -- it's mounted very sturdily on its base, and you can put it in any position you like and it stays that way until you change it on purpose. The only thing I don't like is how distorted its reflection is; I wish it were just a regular flat mirror image. I think it's convex on purpose, to give you sort of a fish-eye view of what's going on in the back seat, but it's so oddly distorted that it's kind of hard to tell what I'm looking at, especially toward the edges of the mirror. But it serves its main purposes, which are 1) to give me a view of my daughter in her rear-facing car seat and 2) to give my daughter a view of herself while she rides, which she just loves (she's so vain, haha!).",4
"Carters Quilted Woven Playard Fitted Sheet, Animal","I purchased this for my graco pack n play and it fits perfectly. Some reviewers have said it does not fit on theirs and this is why, if your pack n play has the two short sides curved up then it won't fit but if all four sides are flat then it will. Hope this helps :) Haven't washed it yet so I don't know how i will feel about my rating after I wash it but for now it remains at 5.",5
"Miracle Blanket Baby Swaddle Blanket, Pink","I bought this for my son when he was six weeks old based on other reviews of this blanket -- and it's truly a miracle. Once you learn how to properly put this swaddle blanket on (I watched YouTube to learn how) it takes less than 30 seconds each night to put it on. This blanket wraps your baby so snuggly that it minimized the effects of my baby's Moro reflex and he began sleeping almost all through the night (he would sleep from about 8 p.m. until 4 a.m.) Prior to wearing this blanket, he would startle easy and wake himself up. I was so sad when he outgrew this blanket around 6 months. Because they don't make a larger size, I transitioned him out of this blanket by graduating to the Summmer Swaddle me blanket and then once he got used to the feeling of his arms being looser and then free, we were done with the swaddle altogether. Another pro to the miracle blanket is that nighttime diaper changes are very easy, and your little one's arms will remain swaddled while you change the diaper.",5
"JL Childress 6 Bottle Cooler, Black","Like all of us, I am very short on time, but am determined to write a review on this product! Previously used a Dr. Brown's bag and encountered the same problems as others (poor quality fabric, ripping, etc).I typically pack my son's food in 4 ounce jelly jars (they're glass and I prefer that to plastic), which are pretty wide. Three of these fit nicely in the top part. In the bottom, I usually have four Dr. Brown's bottles (8 ounces), a YoBaby, and two store-bought baby food pouches. This bag fits it all perfectly. The quality of the fabric is awesome, zippers are pretty good, the handle isn't too long (so it doesn't tangle up), and it's easy to wipe down on the inside.Shortly after buying this bag, the daycare workers commented on how much THEY liked it, as well. We use this bag daily and have experienced fewer spills, easier clean-up and no odor (very much unlike the Dr. Brown's bag). Plain design allows other family members to utilize this bag as well.A MUST HAVE!",5
Honest Company Bug Spray 4 Fl. Oz.,Just used this for the first time and I have 18 mosquito bites and was swatting them away constantly. I love the Honest Company but this stuff simply doesn't  do the job!,1
"Nuby 2 Pack No Spill Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","I bought this type of sippy cup and my 10 month old son loves it. I bought all different kinds and this is the only one he will drink from. There are no leaks and I love it. He has the habit of throwing his cups, and they never break or leak. I also bought the replacement spouts and there great too. The colors do vary. I receved two pink ones but if he likes his cups I'm happy. My son does have a habit about chewing on the spouts but with him even chewing on them they still don't leak. I wish I would have bought this item earlier and saved allot of money. Thank you Nuby!",5
"Cardinal Gates Patio Door Guardian, White","After reading the directions for this item, I thought I was going to have a hard time installing it because the directions didn't make much sense to me. I wound up totally bypassing the instructions and using common sense to predrill holes for where the screws go, both on the door and up on the track. Besides that the product has been excellent.",4
Graco Child Sports Turbobooster Backless Booster Replacement Seat Cover,I was going to buy a whole new boosterseat when my daughter outgrew hers and it was all stained. Saw this and saved a ton of money instead. Booster seat is good as new for a fraction of the price. Very easy to put on and my son loves it,5
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,Am very impressed with this tray - the lip is large enough to stop things rolling off it and the soft material makes it a safe choice as the child wont get hurt in the event of a car accident yet it's sturdy enough to play/eat on! Brilliant product!,5
Fisher-Price Sensory Selections Bouncer,My 2 month old previously had the larger Eddie Bauer bouncer and hated it-too large and no fun.This bouncer keeps her very entertained.Only one problem-my child is small-and her legs barely fit under the 2 side fold-in toys. I wouldn't recommend this for a large child.Other than that 1 drawback-this bouncer is great!,4
"JL Childress Wheelie Car Seat Travel Bag, Black","Served our purpose for 2 flights and then wheels broke on the 3rd. If you want a disposable car seat cover, this is it!",2
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black","Very easy to put on the stroller and stays put.  The cup holders are deep and a great size, not too big or small.  The center space is also a great size and the magnetic flip top makes it easy open/close.  It also has several pockets.  I don't have a problem accessing the zippered compartment of the britax b-agile either...just reach under and zip.  I love it.",5
North States Supergate Pressure Mount Clear Choice Wood Gate,"I've been reading the Amazon gate reviews for a week, trying to find a pressure-mounted baby gate that doesn't fall apart, fall down, make loud noises, permit climbing, or induce injuries.  But for every gate, at least one or two people make those complaints--so frustrating!  I finally picked up this gate at a store because it looked un-climbable, had plenty of notches for sizing it to my doorway, and was cheap ($17 with a coupon).  It works fine in my 30"" door: firm pressure and not at all hard to take up and down as needed.  Contrary to the 1-star reviews, I don't think it's flimsy--what more were people expecting in this price range?  The clear plastic panels are nicer looking than mesh, and my baby enjoys banging on them.  Caveat: if you're thinking about keeping this gate up and stepping over it, consider your height.  I'm 5'10"" and I'm already finding it a (small) nuisance.  Still, after we try this one for a few more days, I expect I'll buy another.",4
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundle Me, Graphite",These will keep your child warm BUT are NOT APPROVED for use with most car seats.  You should not put anything between the baby and the seat.  These are so padded that your child could be ejected from their car seat in a collision (caused by materials compressing -- same reasoning why children should never have a puffy winter coat on their child when they are strapped into the car seat.  There is a way to modify this item -- cutting out the back piece -- to make it safely usable in car seats.,3
"Thirsties Duo All in One Snap, Blackbird, Size One (6-18 lbs)",this is a great diaper. I'm very happy with it ...started my daughter at 3 weeks they fit real well; so this will be my newborn size through probably 3 or 4 months should be growing out of them,5
Fisher-Price: Link-a-doos Open-Top Take-Along Swing,"We received this swing as a hand-me-down, and our baby loves it!  She is 2 months old and is entertained very well in it, and falls asleep better in it than just laying on a blanket.  It is a lot more cost-effective than a full-sized swing, and still makes her happy.  The only downside for me is that it is battery-powered, and that can get expensive especially if your baby is in it a lot.  We are looking at buying Graco's full-size swing that can be plugged into an outlet.",5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub,"My mom was giving me grief about buying this oblong-shaped tub. She said they're often wobbly due to their long shape and its fun shape/design makes it seem impractical. Absolutely false! This tub is sturdy and its shape is fun, cute and practical. The tail end provides excellent support for baby and the head end holds plenty of water. I love the little fishy scoop. My baby loves his shower/bath combo. The green pad where baby's back lay against is made of this non-slip rubber; I think it really helps baby from slipping. The seat insert is solid and sturdy and you can remove it later when baby can sit on their own -- I didn't know that. The only thing I'm not too happy about are the legs that you have to attach/screw on yourself. You will need a long screw driver...which I don't have because I have those fat screw drivers with switchable heads/tips. Anyway, everyone loves the tub. Me, baby, daddy, and even grandma.",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,My little boy loves this toy it is very colorful and he likes to pull at it. I would definitely recommended.,5
"Dream On Me 3&quot; Rounded Corner Playard Mattress, White/Brown",I wasn't sure if I should go with the firm or regular mattress.  The firm is just like the firmer side in her crib mattress.  My 4 month daughter sleeps in the pack and play at night in my room  because I don't want her waking up her 16 month old sister when she cries.  The mattress is perfect.  It isn't a tight fit in the pack and play but its pretty close.  Only a hand has got stuck in between once.  my mom has the regular mattress in hers and it is too soft.  For an older child the regular would be ok but i would go with the firm for a younger.,5
"Kathe Kruse Nickibaby Doll, Blue","This is obviously not a big deal, but I do find it to be annoying that they show the old picture of this product, when that is not what you're getting. They don't make this version anymore. I was buying it because I thought I had finally found the exact replica of the one my daughter had lost. The one I received was larger and has a totally different hat. My daughter was fine with it, but that's not cool. I'm just asking for truth in advertising. No problem with the item itself, just with Amazon giving a false indication of what you're getting.",3
"Imse Vimse Sanitary pads 3 pcs, Organic Regular","I purchased 3 different brands of cloth sanitary pads--&#34;mama cloth&#34; after I had to have a d&c; from a 12 week pregnancy that didn't end will.  I knew from previous experience to expect fairly heaving and intermittent bleeding.Our family has slowly been converting our life style to more organic/natural products.  I'd been using a menstrual cup prior to the pregnancy but *that* wasn't going to work after a d&c;!This brand was by far the best of the 3 I ordered.  The others looked like the sewing machines had the wrong tension--threads were loose, they leaked, etc.The Imse Vimse brand was leakproof and held a lot more than I thought it would!  Plus, these are very very soft and comfy.  They've held up well to the washing over the last 2 months and have not stained which was a nice surprise.  I still prefer my menstrual cup but when I can't use that, these are my &#34;go to&#34; pad.Less bulky than a traditional maxi, too, which is nice!!!  And no wrapper noise or breakage if you wear them for hours on end. I'll never by disposable pads again.",4
Leachco Snoogle Deluxe Total Body Pillow Color: White,"When I got pregnant, my friends told me that I needed to get the Snoogle. I was very skeptical about it, but after a few weeks of rough nights, I was willing to try anything. The Snoogle absolutely helped! I was able to put it in several different positions to help me get the sleep I needed. I also loved spiraling it into a round pillow to lean against when I was sitting in bed. It's wonderful! I won't go through another pregnancy without it!",5
Munchkin Sea Sparkle Gems and Cupcake Squirts Bath Toy,"Hopefully the cupcake squirt toys are packaged separately and on their way. We only received part of this in the mail, and my daughter wanted it for the cupcakes alone. The bath gems and shell are good products, fun for my older daughter.",2
"Infantino Twist and Fold Activity Gym, Vintage Boy",I have a 3 month old son and he loves this. The colors are fun and grab his attention. I was not sure what to expect of the material quality and it's very silky and soft. It was easy to assemble. I was a little overwhelmed with all the different activity gyms to choose from but this product had great reviews and was much more affordable compared to the $80+ cost of similar products. I couldn't be more satisfied.,5
"Lifefactory Glass Baby Bottle with Silicone Sleeve 9 Ounce, Set of 2 - Orange/Purple","I would give this item five stars on quality, but gave it four because they are very expensive for what they are. Given that you can purchase a full sized Lifefactory bottle for the same as what these cost with the additional cost of sippy caps, it's a little disheartening that these cost this amount. However, they are rated highly by most everyone who uses them, and we were looking for glass containers for our children to use to drink from. We don't want them using containers that contain the toxic chemicals so common in everything now - even baby stuff - so we decided it would be worth the extra money for the peace of mind that our children are not ingesting toxins every time they drink. These are good quality, and are the perfect size for our 2 yr old to hold herself and drink from. She has requested to use these particular containers almost every time she gets a drink, since they arrived. We had to order the sippy caps separately, as she no longer uses a bottle, so it added to our cost for these, which is my only gripe. The silicone sleeves are very nice quality and very &#34;grippy&#34;, which makes it easy for our daughter to hold them. The colours are also really nice and are her two favourite colours, so that's a winning point as well. They seem to wash very easily in the dishwasher, and I like knowing that if she doesn't finish her water all in one go, that there will not be anything leaching into her beverage while it sits on the countertop. I am a bit leery of what might happen if it gets dropped, though so we'll see if these last the pace. Since they are made of glass, I am glad for the silicone sleeves, as hopefully that will help delay breakage if they are dropped from a small height...I have dropped the bigger ones a couple of times but they seem not to be prone to breaking easily, so all in all, I would recommend these. I just wish they didn't charge so much for them...I find it very frustrating that everything &#34;healthy&#34; has to cost so much more than conventional items. I want to do the best by my children and give them what will enhance their health and not endanger it, but I feel that it's unfair that the only alternative for more affordable items means that I would then have to accept items which are made using toxic chemicals that offgass and leach...",4
Simmons Kids Tour LX Side X Side Stroller - Silver/Teal,"I'm so happy with this stroller! My kids are 3 and a half (lazy-doesn't want to walk further than 2 blocks) and 9 months old. This stroller is just perfect. Both of them are comfortable in it and they love sitting next to each other.It rides well and it's possible to push it with one hand only on a smooth surface (I couldn't do that with my single umbrella stroller.)It has memory foam padding in the seats and the wheels seem to have some suspension.  The handlebars have two settings. It was a bit tricky to figure out how to recline the seats but you adjust them by pulling the strap at the back up or pressing the latch and pulling the seat down. The canopies could be bigger but they don't point upwards like it may seem in the photo. Overall, I've been through 6 strollers (!) and I rate this one the highest. My daughter says it's her favorite, too! Not to mention the beautiful colors!",5

*SPECIAL PROMOTION*The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Honey - Certified Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN USA),"The necklace came quickly and is easy to use. My 10 month old has been wearing it 24/7 for about a month now (when he's asleep I wrap it around his ankle and cover it in a sock). The necklace itself appears decently durable, looks nice, and I like that there is a knot between each beads so if it were to somehow break, he wouldn't be surrounded by a bunch of tiny choking hazards. He never messes with it on his neck. (I get a lot of comments about how &#34;Isn't he supposed to chew on it?&#34; but no, they are not supposed to chew on it, they shouldn't be able to get it into their mouth and he can't, it does not come up over his chin, so it's a good size).As for how well it works, my impression thus far is that it works at least somewhat. I ordered it because he cut his first two teeth five nights apart, both of which involved him screaming for over an hour in the middle of the night and nothing could comfort him. Both times that happened, a new tooth had poked through in the morning. So, I ordered the necklace. He has cut one tooth since then. He has definitely been grumpy, but there was no hour of screaming in the night. So, I'd say it's helping some but he's still uncomfortable. My older son was not bothered by teething to this extent so this is a new experience for me.",4
The Art of CureTM Certifed Baltic Amber Baby Teething (HONEY) Bracelet -w/&quot;The Art of CureTM&quot; Jewelry Pouch (SHIPS AND SOLD IN THE USA),"since i know a little about beading i was able to restring it to fit my 4 month old chunk butt,,,, it has helped him a lot and it is infact real. just wish that it was a bit larger... if given a choice and not strapped for cash i would have gone with the necklace and just doubles it around his foot",4
KidCo Bath Toy Organizer Storage Basket,"I really wanted this to be worth the money, but it isn't. In it's defense, I have a garden tub, and it isn't very secure when extended all the way. One step up from 99 cent store quality. But my son likes having it in the water with him. It's just another toy now.",3
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","So far, our 8 month old son seems to like this stroller toy. It is very versatile, easily moving from car seat to stroller which is why we purchased it. All the moms in my jogging group are jealous. My one complaint would be that the toys hanging from it were easily pulled off and discarded by my son. We haven't had this toy for more than a few weeks and all the hanging toys are gone. The velcro that they attach with is flimsy. I'll probably put some of the Sassy carseat toys on it the next time we decide to use it.",4
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"These trays are nice, but the lids don't fit very snug.  Once the food freezes though, I stick them in labeled Ziploc baggies. If you want snug lids, I recommend Tupperware brand ice cube trays.  Also keep in mind that if you are making foods that don't freeze solid (like apricots and prunes), it is impossible to remove the food in these trays.  For those foods, I recommend flexible trays and just carefully wrap plastic around it.  Overall, great price though and it does work good enough for me.  But because of the lids, I won't rate it higher.",3
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",Perfect for keeping the dogs in check. Our dogs were taking over the house. Keeps them off the furniture so we can keep the furniture new.,5

"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 4 Pack Bunch-A-Bowls with Lids, Colors May Vary","Disagree with the reviews that say they are too light for feeding and are better as storage bowls. Just have to be careful when feeding and you'll quickly realize they're almost perfect for both feeding and storage. Durable & of high quality. Has served us and lil' D for more than half a year now, and surely beyond. Its microwave-safe too. Although we always warm up D's food in a warmer, this feature helps when her food has cooled down - a quick 10-20 second zap without having to worry about chemicals leeching. The microwave/vented lid comes in very handy. 4 stars only because Gerber should have planned the lids better. 4 complete/solid lids + 1 microwave/vented lid would've made more sense (instead of 3 complete lids + 1 microwave lid). Right now, only able to seal 3 out of 4 bowls in the event all of them are required for storage.",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,Santa brought our 5 month old the Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo and it was a hit!  My husband and I both commented that we were looking forward to when our baby learned how to make the most of the jumperoo.  To our amazement he knew instantly and has been jumping ever since.  He is currently a bit too short but we simply placed something underneath him until his toes touch the floor.  We have purchsed a lot for the little guy and this is by far the best so far!,5
"OXO Tot Divided Feeding Dish, Aqua","I bought this dish and a Sassy divided dish around the same time, to try them out.  I wanted a dish that was at least divided into two:  one side for baby's cereal, one side for baby's pureed fruits or veggies.  I'll admit that I ordered this because it looked cute.  It's cuter (in my opinion) than the Sassy dish.  I wanted to love this dish, but it's just ok.  It does what I wanted, but I would not buy another one or recommend it to others.  Often, when I'm mixing up my son's oatmeal cereal, some of it creeps into the other half of the dish.  I think it's because the dish is kind of shallow.  This does not happen when I'm using the Sassy dish, which is deeper.  Plus I like that the Sassy dish is ergonomically friendly.  I actually went out and bought a second Sassy dish and will just use this OXO Tot dish as a back-up if my two Sassy dishes are dirty.",3
Cloud b Sleep Sheep On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds,"My husband and I were looking for a sound machine for our little one since we live in an apartment and can hear doors slamming and cars and trains all day long. Since this is our first born we are new to everything and thus have done a lot of research before buying anything. We read the reviews on this cloud b sleep sheep and it has lived up to it's great reviews. This sound machine has been amazing and has been used more than anything else we have bought, besides diapers. We love the ocean sound the best and our little one drifts off to sleep easier when it is on. I am also partial to the ocean sound because we recently moved from Florida to Minnesota and it reminds me of home.  The sheep easily attaches to any crib or bassinet with a Velcro strap.  The volume of the noise can be adjusted. The only thing I would change is adding an adjustable timer. The noise cuts off after 45 min and I am constantly turning it back on. It would be nice to have a 1 hour and 2 hour option. That being said, we are very happy about this purchase and highly recommend it to any new parents!",5

Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,I absolutely loved this bouncy seat. I used it for my son since was a couple of weeks old. He loves looking at this fish and the ocean sound is very soothing for him. He also really likes the vibrating feature. It gave me a chance to make a bottle or vacuum really quick. Also it is very durable and easy to clean. I hope to be able to use it for my next baby.,5
Baby Trend Silverado Sit N' Stand Plus Double Stroller,"Does the infant car seat adapter come with the stroller or is it something that has to be purchased separately? We have a snug ride infant seat for our Windsor stroller.  We have a 22m daughter that is tall for her age and doesnt' love sitting in strollers.  However,  she is too young to just have the bench (I don't think she's tall enough yet either).  This stroller seems like it would be perfect for us for my daughter's age.  She'll be 27m once the baby arrives, but we have a lot planned this summer (weddings, summer home) that will require her to ride in a stroller for a little while.Thanks so much",5
Tiny Love Symphony in Motion Farm Animal Mobile (Styles May Vary),"This is hands-down the best thing we bought for our fussy baby. It was one of the only things that would calm him down, and give me a chance to shower or do anything that didn't involve holding him.

Our second son will be born next month, and we plan to get the same mobile for him.  [...]",5

The Portable Baby Wrap Carrier - Chocolate Tangerine,"I love my wrap carrier! I was looking at woven wraps but theyre soooo expensive and, from reading reviews, theyre too hot to even put on in the summer. it's easy to tie, and you can find soo many different ways to tie it online. I'm breastfeeding and I can easily feed my daughter in this with out anybody knowing what I'm doing. Great product for the price. you could probably easily make your own if you found the right fabric, but you'd probably pay about the same price anyways.",5
Bambino Mio Fresh Cleanser (750grams/26.5oz),"one scoop in the diaper laundry hot water and a good dose of detergent will clean up those diapers. I use this with Mrs Meyers and together they take the stink out although, sometimes it requires a soak. This product warns that it may fade colors over time.

This works pretty well to get yeast out of the diapers too.The container says it contains sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate. it does not list other ingredients.",5
"TYKE TOTER Front Mount Child Bicycle Seat (Age 2-5 yrs., Weight Limit 45 Lbs.)","My girl - almost 4 - absolutely LOVES the Tyke Toter - beyond any doubt! I also love it - but I cannot give it 5 stars because there are some irritants!1) The foot-rest does not work very well on my bike (I have a Public Bike - [...] - and the frame just isnt fat enough for the foot rest, so it slips and slides during the trip.2) Irritant only - but obviously - you have to throw your leg over! It is obvious - but only once you have it :) I didnt think of it and almost tipped over once.3) If you DO tip over - remember your kid is NOT strapped in place so she will ALSO tip over! That is why I accentuate that this is for slow city biking with very low speed!I have though given it a 4 because I LOVE IT - despite its faults! My daughter talks to me and comments things and kisses my cheek and we are really close! I can point things out to her, I can show her stuff without shouting and I always know how she is doing!Love it!",4
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I purchased the ventaire because of the unique system for keeping air out of the baby. Unfortunately, they didn't have the larger nipples like the playtex nurser until just recently. The baby didn't like the smaller nipples and I was 'stuck' always feeding him before bed. With the natural shape nipples coming out, Dad feeds him formula before bed and I have some freedom! Alex is happy because of no air in his belly, Mom can go out and Dad gets to bond with him -we are happy!It's 2007 and our second baby has used the same bottles! We would still highly recommend them! We had to get the pink rings and more nipples but that is it! Definately worth the money!",5

PumpEase Classic Collection hands-free pumping bra - Verry Cherry - M,"This is my first and only hands-free pumping bra, so I cannot compare it to any other option out there. But I will say that the PumpEase is extremely comfortable. It is basically a bandeau top made of what feels exactly like bathing suit material. It has no bones or anything and even the hook-closure section is bendy, so the whole thing wads up like a bikini top, which is great for portability. I have mine stuffed in a pocket in my pump bag which I take to work everyday. Sometimes I wear it all day under my nursing tank. It's not meant for this and as such offers NO support as a bra, which is fine-- I just want you to know that if you need/want to, you can wear this under other things. It's comfortable enough for that and I couldn't tell through my other clothes.PLus, I know it doesn't matter, but it is SO cute. I look down and manage to feel happy at my bright red dotted bra, despite, you know, the fact that I'm milking myself. :)As for sizing, the closure has three rows of hooks so you have some wiggle room within a size. I'm a 38DD and ordered the medium. I'm exchanging it for the large. The medium was a bit too tight even on the loosest setting. The website says to go by your nursing bra size, which is why I got the medium, but as we all know, sizing is different even within a brand. I would recommend measuring yourself and ordering that way. The website helps you!",5
Chicco KeyFit 22 Cortina Travel System Sahara,"After problems with numerous travel systems (Graco and Eddie Bauer) we went with the Cortina. It is so much easier to use. It is very lightweight and I love that it stands up when folded down. My daughter loves this car seat and stroller. The color is fantastic. Customer Service for Chicco is Fabulous!!! We initially had a slight problem with a tear on the stroller. Most companies want serial #, model #, manufacture date, when and where purchased and your first born.... Not Chicco, they are great. They only asked which travel system I had and they shipped right away the replacement. Now Graco on the other had, when called about wheel warping told me that I should not have used the stroller at the zoo on a mid 80 degree day in Indiana. Needless to say that after having the same problem 3 times this was the straw the broke the camels back. The stroller and car seat went back to BRU and was exchanged for the Eddie Bauer, which also went back. I digress. The Cortina is so easy to use. I highly recommend this to anyone who asks! I wish that they had a convertible car seat available in the US.",5
bumGenius Elemental One-Size Diaper - White,"I bought this as a gift, but I specifically bought this brand because of the rave reviews I had heard from the recipient. She loves it! The service was great, too!",5
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"Like the title says, it's flimsy but gets the job done. Luckily our toddler hasn't figured out how to operate the lock (which is really easy to operate). The screw jacks on the side to adjust for width opening are the flimsiest part of the gate. They are a very diameter and if they are extended out much it's very wobbly. For the trice, I don't know if you could beat it.",3
Calista Hamper,"Very cute hamper at a great price. Very sturdy and fits A LOT of baby clothes. The wood wasn't the color I wanted, so I sanded it down a bit and refinished it to a dark cherry color to go with everything else in my daughter's room. It took the coating great and looks awesome in her room. Couldn't be more pleased.",5
"Orbelle 3-6T Toddler Bed, Natural",This was exactly what we expected. It is very sturdy and my daughter loves her &#34;big girl bed&#34;! My husband had no problem assembling it,4
"Britax Marathon 70 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","I have done many research before purchasing this car seat! I have heard many times about Britax Seats, how comfortable and safe they are! Yes they are pricey but believe me! It's worth it! The seats are so easy to install in the car, it is not as heavy as it looks and when my daughter sleeps, her head doesn't go back and forth when I break or accelerate. The material is so soft, comfy and easy to wash as you can take it off.Would definitely buy another one for my future son!",5
"BRICA By-My-Side Safety Harness Backpack, Pink/Gray","I like the usage factor, it's a good looking backpack, but I wasn't able able to actually use it.  I tested it at home and if my son runs fast away and you yank on the leash, he's going to fall down.  I guess that is the best it gets with any type of leash so it does the job.  We basically just used it as a backpack for his drinks and diapers.  Good enough.",3
Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey,Got this when my son was 6 weeks and he was able to hold on to it bc he likes to hold onto something while he sleeps. I was really getting aggravated when he would wake up wanting his paci and it would be dark so i couldn't find it and it was constantly falling out of his mouth. with this if i swaddle him he can't push it away from his mouth. and he was already sucking soothies so whoever came up with this idea is genius. And i love that you can just stick it in the washing machine.,5
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"I bought this sheet, along with a few others for my daughter's 3 inch mini crib mattress.  All 3 sheets fit with fabric to spare, but after a few washes, there was a little shrinking.  All of my sheets still fit my 3 inch mattress just fine, but if I'd had a 5 inch mattress, I don't know that they would still work.  Still, for my needs this sheet does the trick and I'm very happy with the product.",4
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"We bought this for our daughter when she was 8 mths. old.  She never took a liking to it.  She started walking on her own at 10 1/2 so this was something that was used myabe twice & definitely didn't need to be purchaed.I'm not a believer in using walkers anyway but you can take the wheels off to make it stationary for play, which is what we mostly did.It is a good product but I don't think I would buy another walker again because I don't find them functional or entertaining.The only complaint that I can say is that the wheels would fall off all the time when the walker was moved.",4
Prince Lionheart Premium Wipe Warmer,"I've had the wipe warmer for only five months, and today I noticed the light wasn't on anymore and my wipes are cold! I took it out of the shelf and the back plug was rusted and had moister. What a waste of money. Disappointed with the products.",1
Delta Zoo Loos Upright Lightweight Stroller,"I bought thiis item after seeing other peoples' reviews through another retailer, given the customers gave it five stars...I put it through a rather rigorous weekend at an autumn festival in our area. Unfortunately, through all the mud, rocky soil, and bumpy, grassy areas its manueverability proved to be barely mediocre.  If you are buying a lightweight stroller for trips to the mall or other easy terrain, it should be fine, but I do not suggest it as an off road vehicle.  Also, the safety belt is somewhat flimsy compared to other strollers.  I'm pretty dissapointed, and will probably have to buy another stroller.  Bummer...",2

"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Froggy","We have this potty and the """"BABYBJORN Potty Chair"""" my son prefers this by far over the Bjorn chair. Both are extremely easy to clean. But this one is just more comfortable. He likes sitting on this one when given the choice. The splash guard is great. The handle on the back makes it really easy to carry around. The bowl lifts out to carry to the potty and empty/clean)  I don't really care which chair he uses as long as he likes sitting on the potty. I wish that this chair had the rubber on the bottom like the Bjorn. I didn't realize aiming your butt when you sit was a skill till recently.Get this potty chair your kid will love it. They might even use it :-)",5
"Angel Dear Swaddle Blanket, Dinosaur Dot","I read reviews on both Angel Dear & the other popular brand of muslin swaddling blankets out there before finally deciding on Angel Dear. I'm glad I did-it's very soft & very pretty in the Ikat print. I just received it & haven't used it or washed it yet but first impressions of the quality are very good. I also like that it isn't packaged in plastic by manufacturer (although to ship it was in a plastic bag inside the box) so there was no chemically smells as a result, like I had previously read was an issue with the other brand. I will definitely be purchasing more in different prints!",5
"Real Nappies Bioliner Flushable Diaper Liners, 600 Sheets","I got these for my son and was very disappointed to find how scratchy they are.  They are a good size and do catch all the poop really well, but I can't get past the thought that they must be so uncomfortable on my son's behind.  I'm trying to find another brand that works as well but is softer.  If I find a suitable replacement I'll update with what I find.",2

Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"I wish toy manufacturers would stop putting stickers on baby/toddler toys!! I've had this toy for 3 years, I think factory batteries it came with are dying now - after 2 babies it looks awful!!Really, battery life is great, and unless you have a 'peeler' it will look perfect for several kids!",5
Combi Urban Trifold Stroller in Lawn,"I really like this stroller, very light weight and sturdy.  Although there are improvements that can be made, for example -(1) seat doesn't have multi-recline, can't adjust for babies under 6 months(2) the basket is on the small side(3) the front wheels are a little hard to move around - you have to make sure it's not locked by accident(4) no parent traysBut I don't mind these minor draw backs - because if you compare to regular umbrella (no basket) or light weight strollers, this stroller is much better designed (carry strap, folded small), lighter, and offer more support (and the price is right too - not over pricy like 300+ dollars).  It even comes with a rain cover, which is so nice to have during the bad weather.  I wish I have bought this stroller sooner when I had my first baby.  Thanks to the prior reviewers - I have done a lot of research and I am glad that I finally find the perfect stroller to suit my needs.",5
"Bumkins Waterproof Zippered Wet/Dry Bag, Blue Owl","We got this is a monthly subscription box and we just love it.  It doesn't leak and is a generous size.  I was able to fit a swim suit, a pair of our toddler's swim trunks and a rolled up wet kids towel in it.  The Dr. Seuss print is really cute and it is well made.  The lining is thick, so it doesn't feel cheap like some other ""wet"" bags I've come across.  Great buy!",5
"Angelcare Bath Support, Blue",I ordered this for my new grand-baby and her mother loves it. she says it makes bath-time a lot easier and the baby is less fussy,5
BubbleBum Inflatable Car Booster Seat,I love that this seat is so compact that I can squish it between two larger car seats.  It's excellent for travel as well.,5
"Mossworld Enterprises Made for Mom Snack-Trap, Girl, 2-Count",I used this brand for my son and re-ordered now that I have a daughter.  These are hands down the best snack cups on the market and are well worth the price.  They are perfect for little fingers and prevent messes for sure!  Not to mention they last!,5
Medela Nursing Stool,"This product has made it so much more confortable to nurse my son. I even use it when pumping or bottle feeding. It was easy to assimble (no real tools """"required"""" but I did bust out the drill to make sure the screws were in there good.)A must have for nursing moms.",5
Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,"I am not usually one to write reviews, but felt compelled because this product is so bad! First, they fold the pillow in half (to ship) EXACTLY where you place your head, causing your head to practically lay on the bed while the rest of the pillow is very full. Second, the pillow case is very itchy, not soft at all! This pillow is definitely NOT worth $70. Stay away!!",1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Organic 100% Cotton Knit, Large, Natural","My 4 month old still loves to be swaddled when going in for the night.  He is just 14 pounds so the large is just too big, but the material is soft and light enough for summer. Just wish it had a larger area to velcro to so that it would fit my son better, he can wiggle out of it. I would recommend this if you are looking for a lightweight summer swaddler.",5
"Safety 1st Guide 65 Convertible Car Seat, Victorian Lace","I read so many reviews on this site and on others that said this seat did not come with all of the extra support cushions or a cup holder. There is a Sport version of this seat and that one is not supposed to come with the extras, thats why its cheaper. This exact product does come with everything shown in the picture plus a detachable cup holder, which is all listed in the product description. Okay, now that I have covered what you get let me just say that I love this seat! It is a great size, was easy to install and fits my 6 month old perfectly now and will adapt perfectly for him as he grows. So glad I went with this seat and not a more expensive one! BTW I got mine from Overstock for the same price, but they had free shipping.",5
myBaby Soundspa Lullaby Sound Machine and Projector,"After owning this machine almost 1 year, I must say that not only do I love it, but my 2 grandsons do too. Since the day it arrived, we play one of several lullabies or sounds every night, all night long and during naps daily. It has a timer, but we've opted to have it play non-stop all night, so if a child wakes during the night, the sound can lull them back to sleep. We initially used the projection feature, but found that it is rather loud and bright, so not necessarily good for our purposes. Almost a year later, it is still going strong.",5

Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"These spoons are terrible. Don't waste your money unless you hand wash all your dishes. We put them in the dishwasher and the bowl of the spoon melted after one wash!  We have the Gerber soft spoons and they have been in the dw numerous times with no problems.It unfortunate because these are bright and fun to look at and the soft bowl is deep which helps keep food on it. the handle is comfortable, if a little top heavy.I think Munchkin should use another plastic for the bowls to solve both problems, but until then I would NOT recommend.",1
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,Make sure to  keep your barcode. My toy organizer was too heavy for the suction cup.It repeatedly fell off the shower wall. It cannot be returned if you have thrown out the barcode.,2
"Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory","This pillow was has been a life saver! I bought it in my 20th week of pregnancy and I have been so loving it. Very comfortable. Its really big, but we have a king size bed so it fits just fine with my husband and I. After I purchased it I was kind of worried because the price is kind of high, but I was very very impressed! I would highly reccomend.",5
Eddie Bauer Car Seat Travel Bag,"This is a great, sturdy bag that holds our car seat as well as enough room for a few more things. I would highly recommend this bag if  you're taking your car seat on the plane to be gate-checked. This way it stays clean, any toys on the seat stay on the seat, and it's just easier to handle. My husband says it's a little bit bulky and kinda uncomfy to have on your back, but it's much better than trying to carry it in your hands along with everything else.",5
Kalencom Coated Double Buckle Bag Check/Pink,I was looking for a new diaper bag and found this one. Love it!!!!! it has so much room. The magnetic snaps make it easy to open it one handed. My husband has split stuff on it and it just wipes off so easy.,5

"Flensted Mobiles Nursery Mobiles, 5 Viking Ships","I ordered the Flensted Mobile: Wings Black & it arrived intact today, Jan 8, 2009.  Upon taking it out of the box, the item consisted of 3 flimsy small black cardboard mobiles with a small round red ball at the base, all of which were held together by a thin black thread.  Upon unwinding the pieces, the thread immediately broke causing the pieces to come apart with the red ball rolling across the floor.  What a ripoff!  I paid $57.00 for maybe 25 cents worth of cardboard held together by a yard of sewing thread not even strong enough to keep the pieces together!  Never again!!  James Motley",1

"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","Our little boy just loves this thing... He started teething at around 3 1/2 mos., poor thing... We purchased the light blue Razbaby teether hoping/praying it would help... We freeze it & he LOVES it! He gnaws the heck out of it! The cold helps numb his gums, and the bumps all over the teether part massage his gums... The only issue we have had is that because his mouth is so little, he has a hard time keeping it in his mouth himself, so I just hold it there for him while I'm cuddling with him on the couch or bed or wherever. Not a product defect or anything, just the fact that our baby is only around 4 mos. now & the teether is a tad too large for his pie-hole ;)",5
"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","We've had this unit since our daughter came home from the hospital and have used it well for over a year.  It is an excellent stroller.  Light, easy to operate one handed for folding, carrying.  Cleans easily.  Works very well with the Britax infant car seat. We had an unfortunate mishap with ours in the confusion of getting the vehicle loaded in the rain, where it was forgotten in the driveway and was then backed over with our truck.  Not surprisingly the frame was toast, the cloth portions actually don't look like anything happened to it!  BUT, this is one of those times where you get to decide if you really liked a product well enough to get it again.  If you run your stroller over with a truck, Britax won't sell you just a replacement frame for it, despite being completely detachable from the cloth seat.  In spite of this and without hesitation, we decided to replace it with the exact same thing.  Our new one arrives today.",5
"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear","I make all my sons baby food at home. I can make his food all in one day and then take 3 containers out in the evening and they are thawed by morning. Heat and serve!!! Fast, easy, and I know exactly what my son is eating. I have enough containers to last a week, and the food taste fresh, does not absorb any smells or taste from other food stored in the freezer. Excellant purchase for busy moms who prefer to make baby food at home!!!",5

"Kushies Deluxe Flannel Change Pad, Yellow with Brown Dots",Pros:It looks nice.Made in Canada.Cons:Very thin material with no paddingThe flannel part of the material is made of cotton which obviously becomes useless once it is soiled.The outer backing of the pad is made out of PVC!!! which off-gasses terribly and is one of the worst plastics for your baby to be near.We already have one pad which came with our Skip Hop diaper bag and I was hoping to get something on-par and perhaps larger.  Skip-hop pad is nicely cushioned and both sides have high quality polyester material which can be easily wiped clean.,1

Eco Sprout Laundry Detergent - 24 to 48 loads - UNSCENTED,"We have been cloth diapering for 20 months, and recently developed issues with ammonia smells. I thought I would try this detergent to see if the issue was based in build-up from our trusted brand (RNG - the only brand we'd used from day 1). After one soak with Eco Sprout, we have noticed a real improvement in the stinkies. Really happy with the product.Also wanted to note -- the bag seems small, but comes PACKED, and it only takes 1 tbsp for an entire load (of diapers or clothing), so I do expect this to last a long time. :)",5
(1) Prime Line Automatic Door Closer in WHITE,"The product is very easy to use but some people seem to be missing brains on how to utilize it properly.Read the damm instructions; it's very easy to install and setup is easy.Only pre-concerns you should have are about your doorframe. You want the door closer as close to the door as possible; and depending on your door-frame and vertical position... the wood may crack, so get your drills out. (Not to mention door frames are made of dense-wood)The only minor concerns with the product is that seems to be almost no &#34;middle point&#34; between a &#34;Slow-door-close&#34; and a &#34;super-springy-door-slam-of-death&#34; if your door clasp is very stiff. (By door clasp I mean that part of the door that keeps your door closed.)Because the spring loses most of it's closing tension as the door is in a more closed position; meaning that you're going to set this in a higher tension; resulting in the door being able to close regardless of whatever position you let it go at... or you're going to set it at a lower tension; but the door would only completely close when you let go of it when it's completely open.Again if your door claspy thingy is very soft; this issue is not a concern but if it's stiff; its an issue.There also seems to be a large design flaw with the white piece that goes on the door; because it has a single screw in the middle and it's not perfectly flush... the door closer will always grind across the screwhead. Depends on how much you open doors; if in wider arcs, this problem will appear.Other than that, works as promised; tension seems to hold. For its price point, design, ease of installation, It's a great product.",4

EIO Glass Kids Cup (8oz) (Orange),"My 5 year old son loves warm chocolate milk over juice any day.  So I went looking for a glass cup after hearing about the dangers of using the plastic sippy cups for warm liquids.  I thought I found my answer with these cups.  I was so excited to find a glass cup with the cover so I can take it with me on the road.  Well, my son hates it!  It spills all over and after 5 times, he has decided never to use it again.  So I am back online looking for a glass cup with a lid again.  Don't waste your money, it is too awkward to drink from the lid.  I would recommend the manufacturer should design a lid with a small spout or a slicone straw.  Please respond if you have the cup I have been looking for.  I need a cup that is microwaveable, can handle warm liquids and can be used on the road.  Is there such an item?",1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","Having had a somewhat fussy baby I needed something to carry her around in and still be able to use my hands and after some research decided on this one. It works well and is very easy to get her in and out of. I have used it to walk around with her for several hours without too much issue when she was only a couple of months old. However as she has gotten bigger and heavier sadly my back has started protesting when used for more than an hour at a time and I'm of average height (5'5""""). I'll still use it for short jaunts and/or around the house during fussy periods but that's probably about it. It definitely did save my sanity during those first few months tho.",4
Philips AVENT BPA Free Standard Breast Pump Conversion Kit,I found these when I was pumping for my first child using a Medela pump and Avent bottles. I hated transferring milk between Medela bottles and ones I actually wanted to use - unnecessary waste of milk. I liked them so much that I've bought them as gifts for others who were/are doing the same thing.,5
DadGear Backpack Diaper Bag - Red Retro Stripe,Great product!  We have 3 in diapers adn just took it with us for 10 days in Disney world.  Could not have survived without it! One of the best parts is the wipes dispenser.  There are so many others- like the outside bottle/drink pockets & diaper canopy.  I love it!,5
Fisher-Price Intellitainer Exersaucer,We've had one like this for almost 4 months and our baby loves it.  It has really helped her balance and the strength in her legs. She has always something interesting to play with on either side.  It's wonderful to be able to put her in it and know she is safe and having fun playing by herself. this gives me time to do other things like cook supper.I like the fact she can move 360 degrees and front and back too. You can't do that in regular exersaucer type units.,4
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","We are very happy with this car seat and our 24 months old son really likes it. We did have a problem with it though. When we just installed the car seat, the harness kept getting jammed and we couldn't secure it. My husband finally realized there was a piece of plastic attached to the back of the car seat. Apparently, it is meant to be used with the seat belt when you child goes into booster seat without harness. There was no reference of this in the manual. Other than that, it is a great product.",4
Infantino Park Place Playmat,"The Infantino Park Place Playmat is the perfect size, shape and pattern. I also love how it folds up very nicely. I highly recommend this playmat.",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Twin Electric Breast Pump,"I am so glad I decided to go with this brand of pump. I was struggling with the $300+ price tag of some of the Medela pumps, but I wanted to make sure I got something that worked well and would last for the time that I would be breastfeeding.PROS-Does not loose suction over time. I use it everyday, several times a day a work.Works quickly. It really does quickly stimulate your let down reflex to make pumping go quickly.Very portable. It comes with a nice bag to carry evreything in.Easy to clean. There is no way to get milk in the tubing and the parts come apart very easily to make cleaning a breeze.CONS-The pump does not fit ANY other bottle. Only Avent brand and those are *quite* expensive and are now the only ones my breastfeeding child will use.There are lots of parts to take apart and put back together for each pumping session. It's not complex, just time consuming.I'd say it was a very good investment and I feel that this is the best value for your money. It's durable enough for regular use and the customer service is great.",5
"Child Craft Camden 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Jamocha","We had looked at several convertible cribs at retail stores, and this one was much more affordable, and has all the features we were looking for.

Summer Infant Snuzzler - White with black trim,"The Snuzzler is soft and plush and yummy!  I registered for one and put it in our stroller to make it extra cuddly.  I bought a second one for our bouncer.  Alaina loves to cuddle up in either one and she's well supported despite being a little peanut in these large baby contraptions.  I can't speak to the """"washability"""" of this product as I haven't needed to launder it yet.  I do wish it came in black though...",5
"Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper Bassinet Mini Plush Sheet, Natural",This sheet is fitted to the mattress and there is really no need to spend any money on any other sheets.  This is plush but not too plush.  The price is a bit high but this is the only sheet that will fit the Arm's Reach Co-Sleeper.,5

Munchkin 11349 toddler dip dish 12 pack,This locking version leaks very easily. We bought the non-locking version awhile back and loved those. For some reason this newer model leaks from where the top screws on to the bottom (not the straw part). We have three 2 year olds so we bought 2 2 packs...all of them leak.,2

"Munchkin Two Snack Catchers, Colors May Vary","We have bought 6 of these snack catchers and have even left 2 at grandma's house for visits there.  These snack cups are outstanding for several reasons, but most importantly they are safe and they keep your house, car, stroller, whatever, clean.  Young toddlers (even less than a year) can use this easily and the food does not end up everywhere.  Great idea and it works!  We will definitely continue to buy this product in the future.",5
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","The design of this bottle is unusual. The air vents from the bottom of the bottle, which would lead you to think the bottle would leak from the bottom, but it hasn't so far. The VentAire system is interesting, and I am surprised at how well it works - when it works.This bottle is very picky, when it works it works great, but there are a couple of situations where this bottle has issues. The bottom of the screw cap and the latex vent disk must be 100% dry for the bottle to work. If the vent disk or screw cap are the slightest bit wet, it will create a suction and the air will not vent properly. This will cause air to come in from the nipple, defeating the purpose of this bottle. Also, if you are using a bottle warmer these bottles won't work. I haveThe First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, which uses steam to warm the bottle, and it does not work with this type of bottle. The steam gets the vent disk wet, which renders the system useless.While these bottles work great under ideal circumstances, I can't recommend them. For me, sometimes I need to warm a bottle and sometimes I haven't had time to wash ahead of time. I don't want a bottle that won't work if I'm trying to wash it right before I need to use it. Sometimes you get busy with a baby and with everything else you have to worry about as a new parent, who wants to add making sure you wash the bottles early enough to make sure they are completely dry?",3

"Mimijumi 8 Ounce Baby Bottle, Very Hungry","My 4 month old is EBF and eats every 2.5 hours. As you can imagine that really makes it hard for this Mama to do much away from the little guy and date night with the hubby has really suffered because of it. I have tried multiple types of bottles, all different brands and types. He hated them all and screamed. It didn't matter if the bottle had breast milk or formula in it. I finally broke down and purchased this bottle. I was originally hesitant because of the price and I just wasn't sure it was worth trying. I'm so glad I did!! He took it without a single fight, even with formula in it! He usually makes a disgusted face with bottles but this one he just sort of looked at me with confusion since he was eating but able to look at me from a different angle. I'm so excited to use this when I have errands to run or an evening away!Tip that I think helped:I held my baby close and angled him in the way that he usually lays when bf, eventually he turned a bit but he was fine with it.",5
"New Arrivals Tissue Box, Pink Polka Dot",Love it and it is sitting in my bathroom now and have had lots of compliments on it.  It is fun to look at and I just love it.Thanks for getting it here so quickly.,5
"Joovy Kooper Umbrella Stroller, Yellow","We've had this stroller about 6 months now and overall this is a fantastic stroller.  I shopped around a LOT before buying this stroller and I wasn't disappointed.Pros:-The colors, we have the Appletree, are bright and fun. We get a lot of compliments.-The design.  We also get a lot of compliments on how cool it looks, not like others at all.-The handles are nicely padded and it's much easier to steer with one hand than with other strollers.-Under basket is HUGE.-My DS loves the recline, he can be straight up or laid almost all the way back for sleeping or diaper changes on the go.-The canopy is GIGANTIC!  It shades the sun well while still allowing my DS to see outside, it also covers the seat so well that when it rains he doesn't get wet.  The viewing window for parents is also very large.-Putting it together was a snap.  Literally just snap on the wheels and the canopy and you're ready to roll.-It's super easy to steer and also easy to breakdown.Cons:-The cup holders are really only large enough and stable enough to hold a small bottle of water.  If that's something you're looking for you can always buy an add-on though.-The breaks are really tough to engage and unengage. Definitely not for the flip flops.-I'm 5'2"" so the height is perfect for me.  My husband is just over 6' and has long legs.  His stride almost makes his feet hit the back of the stroller so if you're super tall it might be uncomfortable.-It's definitely not ""compact"" but it's definitely not full-size.  I still take my tiny umbrella stroller when we just run to the bank or something because it's still easier.-There's no front bar or tray with for the baby.  It's not a problem for us but you can always buy one to add on.-Definitely not for newborns or smaller babies.  The lowest strap level is pretty high so it's not something you can use right away.Overall, I absolutely love this stroller!",4
Philips AVENT BPA Free Formula Dispenser/Snack Cup,I hate this product. I was really disappointed with it. it is very difficult to empty the ALL of the measured formula out of the container. And formula gets stuck in between sections making it difficult to change openings. I was really hoping this would help with making a bottle more quickly but it was not worth the money.,1

Malawi Chair,This chair is cute and is the perfect size.  Unfortunately the fabric is very thin.  The first chair we received had a small tear in the left arm.  We decided to return it and get a replacement.  The second chair had a tear in the fabric of the right arm.  We e-mailed the customer service department and asked their opinion on wether to exchange or get a refund.  They replied that the problem was more widespread than they originally thought an we should just get a refund.  I guess we will look elsewhere.,2

Kidco Swivel Cabinet &amp; Drawer Lock - 2 Packs (8 Locks),"Quality-build & easy installation, it's s smart design, much better than I expected and have seen from other manufacturers. I recommend them for child-proofing any rooms where items are stored that little kids shouldn't touch. I was so impressed, I bought another 16 after the first 8 locks purchased. The vendor offered them at a reasonable price. I'm sure they could be broken, but the arms are tough plastic. When installing don't use a drill bit too large for the screws, otherwise they won't fasten securely. By adjusting the mounting screw tightness, they can either rotate easily or require firm pressure to move. The detent notches in the mounting hardware locks the arms in position - a nice touch. On drawers, I find them a little annoying when folded to unlocking position, as you usually can't fold them pointing down, unless your drawer is virtually empty or a deep drawer. For cabinet doors, they are excellent.",4

"Kushies Deluxe Terry Change Pad, White with Mocha Polka Dots","I bought this as a fold-up changing pad for my daughter's changing bag, and it's great.  It's easy to fold and unfold one handed (not too floppy) and any marks wash out without any extra treatment.  I've even used as a small playmat for wet grass - the plastic backing stops any cold dampness getting through.",5
"Cosco High Back Booster, Ava",Need this for the occasional pick up of my grandson and it works pretty well.Could use more cushioning but otherwise is great.,5
"Bummis Super Whisper Wrap, White, 30 Pounds","This brand has proven to get the job done, it keeps things where they belong, washes good & doesn't hold stains.  It perhaps is a little more geared towards girls or shorter torsos- since it doesn't rise as high I get leakage at the top (i have a boy).  When I use these ones I have to keep closer track on diaper changes, but overall I'm pleased.  I also use Thirsties brand, which comes up higher, front & back, & therefore last a little longer in between changes.Also, when using the cover/insert method, I highly recommend getting the flushable liners.  I don't think I would've lasted as a cloth-diaper parent without them.  You just flush the liners down & even if a little leaks onto the insert, its much more manageable.",3
Baby Pink Diaper Pail Liner/ Laundry Bag by Mommy's Touch,"I agree with others - this bag does it's job. I've used 2 of them for 2 months for cloth diapers, and they are holding up well. My only complaint is they don't close well, and would be problematic if you had to travel anywhere with it as they would probably leak, and certainly smell with dirty diapers in there.An added note - Don't put them in the drier. Even on a low heat, the lining of one of mine separated from the bag, partially tore, and has come out.REVISION: Now having used these for nearly 5 months - they are falling apart! The PUL lining is virtually gone in both of my bags, despite line drying them. I have to order another brand, because these are definately moist and leaky when full, and are gross to handle when dirty.  Right now, they leak some in the pail, adding just one more thing I have to clean.  Yuck.",1

These little spoons are sturdy too. Ran them thru the dishwasher already a few times. None of the cheaper spoons at the stores were made so well: non-toxic & BPA-free, BPS-free and PVC-free. We decided to get a second set to keep at grandma's house. Fun colors too!",5
"Ju-Ju-Be Super Be Zippered Tote Diaper Bag with 9 Pockets, Queen of The Nile","I love this bag! It is super cute, very &#34;scrunchy&#34;, very light so it doesn't weigh down when it has stuff in it. But it is huge. It can be a regular diaper bag for twins or if you have 2 kids. I use it for a carryon for my kids stuff for long airplane rides.  It's actually big enough for a weekend trip. It is huge. Look at the measurements. If you are looking for a huge diaper bag this is great, if you're looking for a nice carryon or weekend bag this is also great even if you don't have kids!  I'm not crazy about the brown interior but it is still so cute. I have gotten compliments on it already! You could also easily use it as an extra bag to take with you in your suitcase for overflow at the end of your trip from shopping because it is so lightweight and can scrunch up very small. Made very well too! Like I said i love this bag!:)",5

"Philips AVENT BPA Free Freeflow Pacifier, 6-18 Months,  Colors and Designs May Vary, 2-Count","I like these pacifiers.  They are nice clean and basic looking.  They are easy to clean and the plastic doesn't get all nasty looking, it stays nice and clear.  The only problem I see is something that is the same with all the pacifiers I have bought...water gets inside the nipple and eventually makes the inside of it have a cloudy look.  That doesn't effect the outside of it though. The plate of the pacifier has plenty of air holes to help with air circulation around the skin.The best thing about these is there is no top or bottom to it.  This is good for a baby learning to put his own pacifier in his mouth or a half asleep baby grabbing for it in the middle of the night.These come in a 2 pack of blue and red or green and orange.  Any are good for boy or girl.",5

"Graco SmartSeat All-in-One Car Seat, Rosin","Excellent product as expected from Graco.

The recline feature is wonderful too, my baby loves it.",5
"Petunia Pickle Bottom Abundance Boxy Backpack Diaper Bag, Frolicking in Fez","For the price, I was hoping for the near perfect bag.  It is lacking for me.  I chose this bag for its larger size to have room for cloth diapers and my over-packing tendencies.  The backpack straps were a key requirement as well.  However, here are my main issues:Velcro closure of the main flap is very noisy and has snagged multiple blankets and clothing items.  I suggest PPB change it to a magnetic closure for the flap.Lacking a &#34;mommy pocket&#34;.  Suggest adding a pocket on the back or within the flap to allow room for wallet, phone, a ipad...  just needs some exterior space for mom items that get lost in the bag.Bottle pockets should be insulated.Changing pad seems like it should have more of a laminated, easy to wipe surface.",3
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","A little intimidating out of the box, but just follow the instructions page-by-page.I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this seat, in my hubby's 2003 f-150, in my parent's 2006 toyota camry, and in the middle position of my 2006 ford Taurus, BUT in the outboard positions of my car installation with the seat belt is AWFUL!!! It's just something about the angles of the seat belt and belt path. We were able to get a rock-solid install rear facing with a seat belt in the outboard positions by using a locking clip, WHICH IS DIFFICULT AND TAKES TWO PEOPLE! We have tried, and tried, and tried, but CANNOT get this seat installed tight forward facing, outboard with a seat belt.If you are considering this seat for a forward facing installation in an outboard position with the seat belt in a 2006 Ford Taurus, CHOOSE A DIFFERENT SEAT!If you are installing this seat rear facing with the LATCH system in a 2006 Ford Taurus I think you'll need to call Diono and ask for the shorter LATCH straps.Otherwise I LOVE IT!!",5
"Baby Trend Expedition LX Travel System, Millennium",I suppose this travel system will do a decent job as a stroller but the car seat definitely seemed cheaply made. I bought this item in combination with 2 other items thinking I was participating in a promotion that claimed a single purchase of $250 or more would result in a $50 discount on a future baby purchase. That has not happened and I feel ripped-off. The three items I purchased all seemed a little cheap and flimsy. This will work but I'm sure I could have got the same quality of stroller/car seat for the same price at Costco or Target.,3
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,"It takes a few times to remember to use it, but once you do it's great. I've been able to bottle 2-4 ozs per day and skip pumping in the weekends when I exclusively nurse my son. It fits in pretty much any bra or tank with shelf bra. It's great you can safe the breast milk you'd otherwise throw away that leaked ANC filled a breast pad.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe High Back Belt Positioning Booster,"I bought this car seat for the weight and height limits as we apparently grow our babies fast in this family.  I read the reviews on this site and decided to buy it anyway.  It's true that the crotch strap is indeed too short.  My child complained about his legs hurting and he is skinny.  I immediately call the company and received the longer strap (actually a whole new seatbelt unit) about 5 business days later. 5-10 minute phone call with no hassles.  Just needed to provide the manufacture # and date and my personal info.  We easily installed the seat tightly in our grand caravan using the Latch system.  It's not supposed to move more than 1 inch at the bottom of the seat, not the top head part.  I would suggest going to your local police station or fire department to have them check it to make sure it's installed correctly if you are unsure or are having problems.  The armrest covers do come off easily.  I found 1 on the floor of the van and 1 in a puddle next to the van the next morning.  At least they come off so I can wash off the leftover snack residue.  I will probably attach them with some velcro.  All in all, I am happy with this car seat.",4

"Child Craft London Euro Style Stationary Crib, Jamocha","I spent a lot of time looking at modern style cribs, most of which are very overpriced. My husband smartly talked me out of spending that kind of money. We've been using this crib for 6 months and are very happy with it.  It sits lower than most cribs.  There's no difference in height for the baby (still the same distance from the top rail, but it's lower for the parent).  I'm 5'8"" and love the height.  It makes moving the baby from lap into crib extremely easy because I don't have to go up and over the rail.  With this crib sitting lower, there's not much storage space underneath. You can put stuff there, but would likely need to lift up the crib to be able to access, and once the mattress is on the lower setting we probably could only fit very shallow storage bins. We've moved it twice already and assembly was pretty easy. Very happy overall and the money saved I used to get a nicer foam mattress, which I'm really happy with.",4

Philips AVENT Express Food and Bottle Warmer,"For busy moms, it is essential that a heating unit be designed to shut off for safety's sake! More than a few times I have returned to the kitchen and found that either my husband or myself forgot to flip the off switch and the remaining water is steaming away. Don't know what would happen if it gets to the point in which there is no water left...Also, for a unit where time is key, it has no TIMER!!! I always have to hunt down a timer (usually my phone) and keep track of it that way. And as others have said, the light on the front of the unit only tells you when it is actively heating the water, not that the unit is on OR that the bottle is ready.The only thing this unit does well is heat water. You have to do the rest.",1

Not too wide...we needed to try and get 3 seats across the back of my husband's Impala amd we succeeded. We have this seat, an evenflo high back booster and a rear facing Roundabout.

Fisher Price Smart Stages 3-in-1 Rocker Swing,"We registered for this, but also recieved a bouncy chair, so never used it as the infant seat.As a swing, my son didn't really like it until almost 7 months. For smaller infants, I think it doesn't recline far enough.  The seat holds a child almost sitting upright.  Our son prefers the higher rocking level, but both are fine. We don't use the music  much, though there's no problem with it. I tend to put him in this to watch his Baby Einstein videos, so the music is unnecessary.My son doesn't use it as a rocker, yet, but my almost 3-year-old niece loves it and spent plenty of time sitting in it last time she visited. It's a nice comfy chair and I look forward to my son using it up to that age at least.It's great that it folds up, we put it away anytime he's not in it, and I've even been able to easily fold it up and take it outside to swing on the porch.I took off one star because it's far too easy to stop the rocking when it's in swing mode.  Walking past it and bumping it, or the dog bumping it, or even the baby's blanket sliding down until it drags on the floor causes the rocking to stop.",4
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,I just bought the Isis pump today and I can't believe it. I wasted money renting a pump for three months. The Isis pumps more and faster than the electric pump. You control the preassure and it cost so much less. I wish that I had tried this pump first. Th only draw back is that it doesn't come with 8oz bottles. Anyone who is thinking of renting a pump or buying the other more expensive electric pump don't waste your money.,4

"Born Free Trainer Cup Spouts- Twin Pack, Colors May Vary","While I thought this was a great option after the bottle, I have only recently discovered what a poor design this is. We've used them for months with no apparent issue. No major leaking( will do if you turn the spout upside down like most cups) but the spout has a small lip on the inside of the rim. You have to turn the whole thing inside out and use a small pointed object to dig around that rim to clean it. I've tossed one already that had developed mold. Almost impossible to clean this. Wish I had known about this sooner but who designs a lip on the inside?",1
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Bancroft 2008","I am very pleased with this pack 'n play. We used it as a crib for the first month and are now using it as a secondary sleep place. While it can be challenging to set up and take down, the instructions are very clear and after a few attempts, it will come naturally. This PnP is much sturdier than another playard (BabyTrend) we borrowed for a weekend trip. The only complaint I have is that the changing table and mobile don't fit in the storage bag. While I could care less about bringing the mobile on vacation, it would be nice if the changing table would fit (hence 4 instead of 5 stars). Also, it is worth noting that the changing table pieces are difficult to take apart. Overall good, sturdy PnP--I would highly recommend.Update April 2011: I used this for baby #2 and it is still working well. We've taken it all around the world so it has had its fair share of baggage handler tossing--it is still sturdy. Love it.Update December 2012: I am still using this product for baby #3. It has held up well, but the bassinet feature is starting to sag a little. But, after 3 being used three times, I would say this thing is quite durable.",4
"BabyHawk Mei Tai Baby Carrier, Black/Lime Motifs","Most of all I got this carrier because it is a nicely modified version of the Mei Tai carrier. I really like the head support that this carriers offers to my baby. Often the Mei Tai carrier look like the do not have any head support and the baby just hangs in there, this carrier is really good for this reason. The fabric is durable and feels very nice. In summer it can get quite hot when wearing this carrier. Yet I really enjoy it's style and comfort most of the time. It easy to wear and fit not only me but also my husband.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Soothie Pacifier, Green, 3+ Months, 6 pack","I got these for my daughter when she was 4 months old, since she only would take the newborn version of the Soothie pacifier but we were only down to two. The rubber is much harder, which is why they are for babies 3+ months, but my daughter never ended up liking them. She is exclusively breastfeed and really only uses a paci when she is sleeping but even now at 7 months she still prefers the 0-3 month version with the softer rubber. She was a preemie though (born 6 weeks early) and is in the lower tenth percentile for weight, so maybe she will end up liking them eventually but for now, she does not.",3
"Joovy Nook Highchair, White Leatherette",Great highchair. Affordable. You don't have to do anything to put it together-just unfold it and it's ready for use. Nice removable tray makes cleaning up after a baby a cinch. The chic leatherette seat is a nice bonus. Highly recommended.,5

If it were to remain in place, I'm sure we would not have the messes that follow a 1 & 2 year old with a snack. The colors and materials are nice. I like the handles and the space inside the cup. I just wish there was a better way to keep the lid fastened to the rest of the container.",4
WubbaNub Giraffe,The feet are bean bags which helps keep the WubbaNub in place.  The Giraffe body is longer which is more useful in propping a bottle if needed.,4
Jeep Car Seat Travel Bag,"I bought this cover my Chicco Key Fit 30 car seat. I was impressed by how much room it had. It will definitely fit a larger convertible seat when we switch to that. I love the handle, it makes it very easy to carry. When my brother picked me up at the airport he was shocked that I was able to get myself, my baby, this bag with my car seat, a large rolling suitcase, and a backpack out to the curb without help. Great way to keep your car seat clean and very affordable!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Both my 4 month old and my dog love Sophie the Giraffe. She squeaks like a dog toy which makes things a little confusing for my pup. But my baby is teething now and loves to gnaw on Sophie - her face, her legs - any part he can get in his mouth. I'm not sure what it is about this toy but he loves it so I can't complain!Update: 11/2013Well, Sophie is cute, and absolutely everyone has one. But... in hindsight, I think it was a waste of money. My son gnawed on her for maybe 2 weeks and then moved on. For the price, I could've bought 5 different teething toys instead of just this one.I think at this point Sophie has become a must-have toy because it's so pervasive in the new mommy culture, but really... I'm just not impressed. Several other moms I know have said the same. It's cute and makes a great gift... but it's really not used much for what its intended.",5
Leachco Lily Pod Compact Soft Baby Bath Tub,"This worked great for sponge bathing our newborn on the counter and later on worked great in the tub for baths.  I liked that it was soft and stayed warm with the water. The better you get the water out after each use the longer it will last. Ours started to get a bit funky after 8 months of use, but we def got our money's worth of use.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I love the Twilight Turtle. It was maybe more money than I wanted to spend, BUT my baby was completely transfixed and soothed by it--which is worth every penny. I want one of these for myself now.",5
Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair - Brown Swirls,Bought this to have for when my grandchildren come over.  It is sturdy and comfortable for the child.  Easy to clean and seems to be well made.  My daughter liked it so much she bought two and uses them exclusively for her twins instead of a traditional high chair.,5
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,"These are the best child proof devices that I have found. I have bought many different ones, that my child learns to open, but these have finally beaten her back. She is unable to use her grip to squeeze this open. The length is ok, although you can't adjust them. They are now on my fridge, my stove, my freezer and cabinets in my kitchen and now bathroom. You need these.Morgan",5
"Britax Roundabout 55 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx","Our pediatrician recommended this car seat and we couldn't be happier. Lots of research went into the safety and size of the car seat and it paid off. This is so comfy and it fits great in our 2003 Nissan Sentra. Right now it's rear facing and our son loves it. It's tall enough that he can see out the windows and makes traveling so much easier. My favorite part is how easy it is to buckle him in.I only wish the cup holder was included, we ordered it as well and it was worth it.",5
"thinkbaby Stainless Steel Baby Bottle, Silver, 9 Ounce",Love the plastic version. Unfortunately the treads for the straw/lid don't line up. Leaks. Disappointed.,3
Manito Elegance Plus Stroller Weather Shield / Rain Cover (Red - 5 Available Colors),great cover for strollers. Better than the generic plastic covers that get all crumpled and difficult to use. we saw another mother using it and had to buy it,5
Infantino Firefly Soother,"This Infantino Firefly Soother did it's job well in my house.  It truly entertains my 1 1/2 year old cousin, Nickie.  From what I can tell, she most enjoys it when the music is off and the characters are jumping about/lighting up.  She loves pressing the button to change the scene.The device has music that you can play along with it that admittedly covers up some gear noise heard when the music is not playing.  Tunes include music and 'nature sounds'.  The nature sounds are my favorite of the two choices.Overall, this Firefly Soother is a cute device that does its job well.  Nickie seems to love it!",4
"Carters Keep Me Dry Water Resistant Flannel Crib Pad, White","For my first son, I bought all sorts of the typical waterproof pads for the crib - most of them were soft quilted material with a vinyl sheet inside - soft enough and not &#34;crinkly&#34; and worked pretty well. I recently came across this product and thought I'd try it to help my preschooler keep the mattress dry and this really works. Every once in a while his diaper overflows and sure enough, it will not penetrate beneath this pad. I like to use this with a sheet over top of it, on top of another sheet on top of a Wet Stop twin bed mattress waterproof cover, and the water will not get to the waterproof mattress cover. I love the Wet Stop as well and I know for sure the mattress will be dry when I use either or both of these products. The nice thing about this flannel crib pad is that it's easy to pull on and off (without having to change a fitted mattress pad) so it's nice as your &#34;top layer&#34; of protection. It's very soft just as you'd expect flannel to be. I've washed it normally and it still works after that, so no worries there.",5
"Summer Infant Step-By-Step Potty Trainer and Step Stool, Blue/ Green",This potty trainer is so cute and easy to use! My little munchkin loved it! Especially since she gets to have her own roll of toilet paper to use! I love how we can also use it as a toilet seat and step tool. the price is well worth it! The only  problem is that standard baby wipes won't fit in the wipe dispenser. But overall it's a great product!,5
Luv N' Care Nuby Two Handle Sippy Cup 7 oz,"it is a very good training cup when new. but after a few use, the silicone tip cracked easily, then it leaks terribly of course. if one does not mind constantly buying replacement top part for it, then it's fine, but it gets pricy. I am changing to a different cup.",2
"Dwellstudio Stamp Set, City",I bought this as a gift for a friend in another city. I am told he started playing with it right away and loved it!!!,5
Sassy Flip &amp; Grip Rattle 2 Pack,We figured out when my granddaughter was a baby that it is very hard to find basic rattles that really little babies can actually get their hands around.These are great!My daughter,4
"babyletto Madison Swivel Glider, Mocha",Chairs came via UPS.  The slate gray color provides a look of elegance.  Good quality and at a price.  Compare this gliders to those sold by local furniture companies and you will decide to buy these.  We bought 2 and they look great in living room or family room.,5
"Lorex BB2411 2.4&quot; Sweet Peek Video Baby Monitor with IR Night Vision and Zoom, White","I wanted a video monitor (vs audio only) to be able to check on my baby at night. The night vision was then my main interest. After reading reviews, I was not too sure about this product as some people said that the night vision was not that great. I ended up giving it a try. I am glad I did! I don't understand how some people couldn't see their baby at night, blaming the &#34;poor quality&#34; of the night vision of this video monitor. The night vision is AMAZING! My baby's room is very dark (with curtains and blinds) and I still see him at night as if the light was on. I can see what he is doing and I know when his pacifier is on his mattress and where it is exactly (even though he has a clear pacifier!). GREAT PRODUCT!",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Natural Polypropylene Bottle, 4 Ounce, 3 Pack","I love these new bottles and nipples as they are more realistic in shape and comfortable to hold. I DO NOT like the caps that fit over the nipples. The are extremely hard to take off, especially if your hand is wet.",4
"Luvable Friends Geometric Print Fitted Knit Crib Sheet, Blue","Great. Just as expected it would be! super cute and comfy , I love how it looks on the mattress",5
Party Time Girls First Birthday Cake Headband and Cupcake Bib,"These were a big hit at my little one's first birthday party.  The hat was adorable!  It didn't stay on long, but it was nice while it lasted.",5
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White",My three year old figured out how to open this in about two seconds.  It holds my 1 1/2 year old twins back (but not the three year old).  I guess this might be good till they are about two.  Then you will have to lock it with an additional lock (what I do).,3
"Boon Benders Adaptable Utensils, Blue Raspberry/Tangerine",they are cute and soft. I fed the baby by the spoon and gave him the fork for chewing fun. He loves the texture.,5
6 Pcs Baby Newborn Infant Handkerchief Gauze Muslin Square Cotton Bath Wash Cloths Bibs Towels 35x35Cm,Good quality and size. Grandmom loves it.,5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,Works great.  There is a little static BUT I heard my daughter wake up because it picked up louder breathing (she was excited playing with a toy) and I knew she was up before she even thought of fussing.  It can't get any better than that.The base is several feet from her crib.  The baby is upstairs and the monitor works downstairs just fine without beeping.  Excellent for $35.  I can only guess that the people with problems have large houses.,4
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",I love how simple it is to use and very sturdy. I would have prefered some design on it since it looks too plain for being a baby chair (hence 4 stars). It's a hit with my baby. She looks too cute sitting in it!,4
"Hoohobbers Rocking Chair, Blue Mesh",My daughter had one of these chairs when she was a little girl twenty eight years ago and she loved it.  She now has her own daughter and her daughter loves it too.  So glad I was able to find one after all this time.Delivery was on time for Santa and the condition of the chair was perfect.  Thank you for the excellant service.,5
Photography Prop Baby Costume Cute Crochet Knitted Cap,"Little bigger than id hope but no biggie. Once i have her she'll jus grow into it. Although the diaper part is big,.i love it. Cannot wait to take pictures. Afterall didnt pay much but i feel i got my moneys worth. =)",3
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","The other carriers are not the same. It's a big purchase especially in light of needing so much for a new baby, but this is worth the money. When we go places that the stroller is too big for, like small stores or small restaurants, we take our baby girl in this. She chills out in it and likes feeling like a part of everything around her. Very sturdy and safe. Might also want to keep in mind though that the baby will need a sun hat when going out in this.",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"*** UPDATE APRIL 2011:  I have machined washed this several times (line dried) and it still looks brand new.  Nothing has torn off or faded.  Happy Happy Joy Joy!  ;)This is a visually beautiful and highly interactive rattle style toy.  My daughter did not really take to it until she was 3 months old, though -- don't think newborns are going to get much out of this.  She loves it now, however.  The only con (my opinion) is that this is a cloth toy that cannot be submerged in water.  It can only be surface wiped which I don't like for sanitary reasons... She is in teething mode and constantly putting it in her mouth.  That said, it is a very nice interactive toy with lots to look at, touch, shake, squeeze and pull.  The wings even make a crinkling/crackling noise somewhat similar to a potato chip bag.  Interesting little toy.",4
"Playtex Lil' Gripper/Anytime 9 Ounce Straw Cup, 2 Count, Colors May Vary","These are my favorite because they are the only ones my son cannot open by himself.  This is a huge plus.  They are generally leak proof and we haven't seemed to had all the issues that others have noted.  I will agree that the straws inside are a bit too short.  I have cut regular straws to replace lost ones and just make them longer.  I have only had problems with leaking when the cups were closed very tightly and it was sitting in a hot car or some similar temperature change.  However, I have never found cups that never ever ever leak a bit.  I am happy with them and will be buying more.",4
"Dr. Brown's 3 Pack BPA Free Polypropylene Bottle, 8 oz","We switched to Dr. Brown's BPA free bottles after using the Playtex VentAir bottles for 5 1/2 months with our newborn.  The Playtex VentAir worked well enough until about 4 months when the baby started to extensively drool while feeding to the point where 1/3 of the milk would end up on the baby.As an engineer, I never did like the way the Playtex VentAir vented from the bottom.  To vent, you can't tighten the bottom too much. But that would lead to leaks from the bottom.  So we switched to Dr. Brown's to see if we can eliminate the drooling while feeding.  Sure enough, the venting mechanism works much better and the baby no longer drools while feeding!To prevent leaks, you have to strictly adhere to the maximum fill line (3/4 of the bottle).  Going above the fill line will guarantee leaks because too much milk would enter the venting tube.  To shake the bottle for mixing, you have to inserts the flat plastic disc inside the cap between the nipple and the venting seal.Since milk is a great medium for bacteria growth, we usually soak the bottles (disassembled) in a soap bath for at least an hour and then just rinse everything in cold water.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","These bottles are the only ones that don't get my little one all gassed up!:-)  I've used Nuk, Avent, Pampers, store brand, Playtex Nursers and even Dr. Browns.  Dr. Browns have way too many pieces to clean and I never quite felt they were clean enough.  The Born Free bottles have only 2 extra pieces for the vent and are super easy to clean.  The inverted nipple part of the vent can be cleaned very easily by using your nipple brush.  I know they aren't different colors and are kind of plain, but you can get glass bottles and buy colorful sleeves for them if that is important to you.  I highly recommend these, it's worth the price!",5
"Bbox Diaper Wallet, Flower Power",Slightly bulkyfits either diapers or the changing mat in the lower sectionthe blue cap remains loose and needs to be fit snugly..doesnt lock in easilyoverall can be made better quality for the price,3
"Kiddopotamus CozyUp Carrier Cover, Navy &amp; Ivory",I ordered this over the jj cole one because you did not have to put it under the baby... safer.  I was happy to have a way to keep her warm and dry without tossing blankets all over the place.  The pink is great to help people know its a girl with a neutral colored car seat.,5
"WubbaNub Infant Plush Pacifier - Limited Edition Set (Okey Dokey Dino, Mango Monkey and Monkey &quot;It's a Boy&quot;)",My son has always loved these. So when I seen these 3 I couldn't resist,5
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar",My son has two Wubbanubs that we love. So I bought this for a friend for her little girl. It is absolutely adorable!!,5
"The First Years Soothie 3-Pack BPA Free Bottle, 9 Ounce, Colors May Vary","We started using Dr. Brown's bottles for my daughter.  She had terrible acid reflux, and they didn't seem to have any effect.  We tried the Playtex drop ins, still no luck.  We tried the Avent bent necks with very little improvement.  We finally tried these Soothie bottles and they were like a miracle.  She went from projectile vomit to regular baby spit up.  What an absolute relief!  I'm now pregnant with #2 and was THRILLED to see Amazon carried these (and they were on sale at the time).  They were very easy to clean and never leaked for us.  We started using them at about 3 weeks and she used them right up until she turned 1.",5
"Vital Baby Toddler Straw Cup, Orange, 10 Ounce","When I first got this cup I washed it very well and put water in it for my son to drink. Making sure that the straw was working (it was my sons first time with a 'straw' so I didn't want him to be discouraged) I took a sip and it WREAKED OF CHEMICALS. I had to have it soak overnight in Dawn. My natural Method soap usually works with everything but not this smell. Then I has him try it the next day and as he learned to use the straw (he got the hang of it right away) it also leaked all over his shirt. When you tighten the lid tighter it's a pain to get off. When you hold the cup I can see watch it spill as if it's over flowing. I'm so disappointed but you get what you pay for, right?",1
"Medela Slow Flow Wide Base Nipple, 3pk/0-4 months",I was looking for the 0-4 month nipple everywhere in stores and found out that I could only buy it online. I was pleased that I received it before the date promised and my son is now able to drink his bottle without taking in too much formula.,5
Munchkin Baby Laundry Bag,"These bags are much smaller than I anticipated and are really ony worth using for tiny socks, hats and mittens - the bag helps keep all the tiny items in one place and can be hung on the line or air dryer to dry - thus keeping all the items in one place.I suppose you could fit up to 3 layettes in the bag at one time and then add the bag into your regular laundry wash - however I am still looking for something at least 4 x as big to utilise each time I do a load of washing.",2
Mamas &amp; Papas Urbo Stroller - Raspberry Ripple,"I love this stroller, but most importantly my daughter loves this stroller and it seems so comfortable.  She stays really long and puts her feet up and just relaxes.  With her prior stroller, she refused to stay in it no longer than 5 minutes.  No, it does not have a cup holder, but that is fine with me and the seat has to turn outward to close the stroller.  I find it easier to just remove seat and put it in the trunk separatly.  other than that, so far so good.  The two cons I mentioned are the least of my worries.  My favorite thing is the shade and how it covers her completely and that was non-negotiable item that we absolutley needed.",5
Baby Einstein Discover &amp; Play Pack 'n Play Portable Playard,"I needed a Bassinet and Playpen for our second daughter. This was perfect. It can be both, is a nice good size but not huge. Very easy to assemble and transform. Bright colors. Love the caterpillar. East to maneuver and push when needed to move.No complaints here.",5
"Disney Pooh Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats , 50-Count","These were the first table-toppers I purchased and I loved that they helped contain messes and also kept my little one from eating food off of a table. But, I soon encountered a better solutions... there are other table toppers that are biodegradeable (the Pooh ones are plastic). The other brand also is mostly black and white, and my my older kiddo enjoys coloring on them. Overall these type of products are great for early self feeders, but I prefer the ones that will biodegrade.",3
"American Baby Company Jersey Knit Crib Sheet, Lavender",This sheet fit great on our crib mattress and held up in the wash. It's very soft and comfortable. Would buy again,4
"Contours Optima Tandem Stroller, Hudson","I love this stroller,easy to adjust the seats & maneuver, perfect for my 9 month old twins! The only thing I do not like is that I have to completely remove both seats from the frame for it to fit in the trunk of my car.",4
"Playtex TrainingTime Soft Spout Cup, 6 Ounce, 2 Pack, Color May Vary",Update:Made sure the rubber insert is in the correct position and fully pushed in. Also lined up arrow to base of cup and tightened. Works great now!It's leaking! I don't like that color vary since we received pinks and purples for our son. I don't know how to make the cup stop leaking; I'll have to look into it in the reviews. I bought this specifically so it wouldn't leak.,5
"Britax Roundabout 55 Convertible Car Seat, Isabella","Given this is our first baby we researched like crazy for car seats and landed upon this model of the Britax. The price is reasonable and i love the fact that it can last us up to toddler stage so we am saving more money here.If you are looking for a car sear consider this one, its very sturdy and despite some of the reviews it was actually quite easy for my husband to install.",5
"American Baby Company 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Natural",I bought two different sheets for a recent port a crib purchase.  This one was a little bit more costly but far superior and worth the extra price.  It was soft out of the package and held up well to laundering.,5
Cotton Tale Designs Nightingale Balloon Valance,"I recieved these after looking everywhere for the best price.. I ended up having to buy 2. My window is 60"""" and the valance didnt work. The only proble is one is slightly longer than the other one.. it hangs down longer so i had to pin it up which i didnt think i should have to do for the price I paid. Other than that they look great!",3
"UPPAbaby G-Luxe Stroller, Black Jake","I was originally hesitant to spend so much money on an umbrella stroller, but it was completely worth it! I pushed the stroller my mother bought for my daughter, that seemed very similar, but was only $50 and boy what a difference in maneuvering!!! This stroller is so easy to open & close and I love that it has the recline feature and the extra sun panel. And it's super light too. The only thing negative I can say is that it is a little difficult to get the seat back upright if your child is sitting in the stroller, but other than that, a great buy.",4
Philips AVENT Newborn Starter Set,"OTHERS HAVE WRITTEN THIS BUT THE KEY TO NO LEAKS (TOOK US 8 ANNOYING MONTHS TO FIGURE OUT)**** DO NOT OVER TIGHTEN CAPS, ONLY SCREW ON UNTIL THEY STOP...DO NOT CRANK THEM FURTHER ********I ALMOST THREW IN THE TOWEL ON THESE...THEY LEAK ALOT IF YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED THIS OUT. NOW I LIKE THEM AND WILL USE THEM AGAIN.",4
GroVia Reusable Cloth Wipes - 12 Pack,"If you want a soft soft cloth wiper this is a good choice, but you have bear that there will be small cotton tissues falling off all the time.  I used this to wipe my baby's face, it leaves so many white tiny cotton tissues all over his face, I had to carefully use pick them out and use another cloth wiper (my mom gave it to me don't know the brand) to clean my bb's face again.Wouldn't recommend to use on baby, but ok for adults.",2
"Delta Canton 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Dark Cherry","The crib was good, but we expected better quality in terms of appearance.  You can see the holes for the bolts; we would've expected them to be in an inconspicuous spot or for the manufacturer to at least provide covers for the holes.  The crib is very sturdy and goes very well with other Delta dark cherry furniture pieces (we have the Silverton dresser as well).  Overall, good value for the money spent but would've liked slightly better quality/appearance.",3
Jolly Jumper Jumbo Toy Hammock,"This was perfect for my needs. I love plushies, but living in an apartment, I had no real place to put them other than the floor. To rectify this I decided to buy this hammock. It holds all of my important plushies like a champ! Very happy with my purchase!I will say that if you have a pet cat, be sure to use the included hooks or your kitty will pull the hammock down.",5
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,"I have tried numerous baby spoons.  I like these the best.  They are soft, pliable and easy to use.  Also, dishwasher safe, which is a must in my house.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"We registered for the diaper champ after comparing it with the diaper genie and diaper dekor at the store.  We had used the diaper genie while working in the church nursery and found it to be extremely difficult to use with the number of diapers we were changing there.  Now our own baby is four months old, and we have loved having the diaper champ at home.  It is so easy to use and does not stink, or at least it hasn't yet.  We use Ruffies scented garbage bags and change the bag when full, about every five days.  I would definitely recommend the diaper champ.",5
BRICA Cover Guard Car Seat Travel Tote,Worked well for our travels and held up nicely.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a solid car seat carrier.,4
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","I had one of these with my firstborn son but wanted a different print for my soon to be daughter.  I LOVE this print, absolutely gorgeous lavender.  Goes with my daughters nursery theme perfectly.  These pillows truly are the best, breastfeeding or not it makes holding baby for feedings so much more comfy.  Quick shipment but hate ups lack of customer service.  Left package outside at gate rather than just bringing it to my front door, yes gate was left open.  They are lazy.  Amazon should switch to fed ex.",5
Snuza Portable Baby Movement Monitor,"We've been using the Snuza for about 2 weeks now. We bought once we decided that our 7 week old was ready to move to his own room, but we were nervous about moving him. This product helped to give me some reassurance so I don't stay up worrying about him and staring at our video monitor.We attach it to his diaper under his sleeper, and then he gets swaddled. The video monitor we have in his room picks up the noise just fine.  We haven't had one false alarm in the 2 weeks that we've had it.  We test it out every night before we use it by putting it on the dresser and not touching it just to make sure it still goes off. It has really given us peace of mind.We have not had any battery issues so for. I'd recommend to any nervous parent!",5
Playtex Drop-Ins System Breast Milk Storage Kit,"I've used it a few times, but they take up far too much room in my freezer.  Lansinoh breast milk storage bags work so much better, they can be used with Playtex nursers.",2
Maya Wrap Lightly Padded Ring Sling - Berries - Medium,"This wrap was perfect for my two month old.  We have tried other carriers that have a lot of fabric and they get too hot in our Midwest summer.  The woven fabric is light and airy and the tail works great as a nursing cover.  It does, however, hurt my back if we wear it for too long.  Be sure to switch what side you wear it on every time you wear it.",4
Prince Lionheart Multi-Purpose Toy Hammock,"the toy net is good, i would suggest it for someone who has lots of little stuffed animals, but for big ones not so good. read the directions about how to hang it :) it holds 2 small pillows and about 6-7 medium sized animals.",4
Vandot 2IN1 Phone Mobile Accessory For Samsung Galaxy S3 i9300 Soft TPU Silicone Back Case Cover Protection Skin Shell Night Owl Polka Dot + 1x Stylus Touch Pen (Flexible color)- Green White Cute Cartoon,"This case has absorbed the black leather color of the interior of purses and slip cases it goes in to, causing black discoloration around the edges of the back. Otherwise it's a good case, fits fine and looks good.",3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I hate this product.  I purchased this swing gleefully!  I was sold on all of the bells and whistles! I rushed home and my BIL spent an hour putting it together.  This toy totally struck out!Strike one:  My BIL placed his tiny underweight 5 month old baby in swing for test ride. While swinging baby lifted her arm to tug at the mobile and the swing nearly fell forward.  Never mind the fact that she could reach the  mobile!Strike two:  The MOTOR IS LOUD!  VERY LOUD!  My washing machine on the spin cycle is like a fluttering butterfly compared to this BEAST!Strike three: THE Music is very annoying!I returned this blasted thing after one day of use!  I exchanged it for the Graco Papasan Swing.  I couldn't be happier!,1
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman","The crib is very lightweight, it looks fantastic, switching back n forth between the napper,changer, playpen isn't difficult. You get your money's worth. Only thing I didn't like is the napper's material looks softer in the picture than it really is. Overall great product.",4
Rockin' Green Classic Rock Lavender Mint Revival 45oz,This was supposed to be for hard water.  Within 2 weeks we had diaper stink.  I had to strip diapers every week on top of using calgon water softener.  Stopped using it and diapers are fine now.,2
"Badger Basket Folding Nursery Basket/Storage Cube, Sage Dot","I wanted a basket for toys with out being an actually basket. this was exactly what i wanted. you just unfold it, put the bottom in, and then put whatever you want in it. its that simple. i had no issues with shipping so it was a great experience. thank you!",5
"Flensted Mobiles Nursery Mobiles, Hedgehog Family",Babies are more drawn to these little guys than they are to my other three styles of Flensted mobiles. Very fun!,5
3 Pack Snack Trap (colors may vary),I bought these for small snacks or cereal for my 2 year old twins. They immediately figured out how to take the lid off and rendered these useless for me. Maybe they work for younger children but for my needs they did not work.,3
Safety 1st 2 Pack Grip n' Go Cabinet Lock,"DO NOT BUY!! Save your money and get something else!! Wish I read the reviews before I made an impulse purchase at the store thinking I should try them out. Well, they didn't even open. The stupid lock did not even open!! Even my husband couldn't open them. What a waste of money!!",1
Munchkin Bath Shape Sorter Bath Toy,"I bought this for my infant son for a fun toy in the bathtub. They don't make very fun bath toys like they used to. However this one is great! The shapes are all different (5 of them) as well as colors. They all haven numbers on them so there's more learning there as well. They also each drain water differently. In the water, the turtle floats perfectly (by his legs) so you don't have to worry about it sinking. The shapes also can stay under the turtle pretty easily. It can be used out of the tub as well as a shape sorter. My son loved it then and he's 3 years old and still loves it! I would highly recommend this toy due to the durability and high educational opportunities.",5
"Luvable Friends Flannel Receiving Blankets, Pink, 5 Pack","These are cheap.  The thread count is low (not sure how low exactly, but I can see the weave very clearly). The edges are surged with thin thread.  They are soft, and the patterns/colors are as shown in the description...but I'd be embarrassed to give these to an actual infant.  I'm getting them for a puppy, so they're fine for her to snuggle into when she goes to bed (after I actually get her- LOL).  They're made in Pakistan (if that matters- I prefer to buy Made in USA stuff, but not always easy to find).  I'm sure the puppy will be happy with them, so that's what matters in my situation- but I'd never give these as a gift. I actually have pretty high standards for my dogs, but since a puppy may end up mangling them, they're fine for first blankets. For a dog.  I'm washing them now- so will edit if anything dreadful happens in the washer or dryer :/EDIT:  Well, the shrinkage wasn't horrible, but like all cotton products, they did shrink (actually made the thread count look a little better).  But it was enough to make the tag loose, so I had to trim it off - very carefully, but the surged edges are so cheap that they just pulled out.  I had to cut each stitch to get the tag loose- though it was pretty simple since the shrinkage of the cotton made the surged edges looser.  I definitely wouldn't give these to a real baby... I'm rethinking even letting a puppy have them (definitely wouldn't leave the tags on for a teething puppy to swallow or inhale).  I won't buy anything by this brand after this.  I usually like most things- check my reviews !!  But these are lousy.",1
KidCo S353 Door Lever Lock White,"My three year old figured out how to work this very quickly.  However, they still keep my two year old from going outside.",3
Euro II Highchair NATURAL,"Whoever designed this chair must not have kids. It was fine when our child was younger and smaller, but as a toddler (19 months), it became almost impossible to get her in and out of it. What the pictures don't show is that the tray is secured with a knob that has about a 3 inch screw. So, to get the tray on and off, you'll have to stand and turn, and turn, and turn endlessly. Which, when you have a toddler who wants to get in or out, is nowhere near ideal. We ended up reselling ours and opting for a different high chair. I suggest you don't waste your time with this chair.",1
"Tommee Tippee Easi Mat, Blue",Same as the first tommee tippee easi-mat I purchased.  Bought two and neither one held plate in place.  Babies could pick up and over turn before I could stop them.  Would not recommend.,1
DwellStudio&reg; for Target&reg; Crib Skirt - Bird,"I got this because I hoped it would be the right color to coordinate with the 30yr old quilt my grandmother made for me when I was little. Now my little girl's crib looks like a little girl's bed!Things I like:The whole thing is cotton, even the part that goes under the mattress.Subtle print.I could buy just the skirt without the bumper (waste of $) or the quilt since I already have one.Things I don't like:Haven't found anything yet.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Really like this product!  So much smaller and easy to use.  Didn't get rid of it, because it is so easy to store for friends with kids.  I bought the competitors for a friend and did not like the features as much as this one.",5

2011 Babys First Christmas - Photo Holder - QXG4199,Thanks!  It was exactly as I thought it would be. Now my poor third child has a birth year ornament too!,5
Summer Infant Securesleep Handheld Color Video Monitor,This video monitor is great!  We owned the Mobi before.  Constant static and trouble keeping a signal from day one.  This Summer Infant monitor has neither of those problems.  The Mobi's vide function quit after a few months and the audio died at about 10 months of use.  This is the monitor we should have bought to begin with.,5
B&eacute;b&eacute;Sounds Portable Color Video and Sound Monitor,I bought another video monitor first and it was bad. Static for both video and sound.It turns out it was not a good fit for my house but it worked great for a town house so ended up getting this one. I've had no issue with it other than the battery dying too fast.  It won't hold through the nigh so I have to keep it plugged in.  Other than that I'm pretty happy with it.,3
"Disney Rocking Chair, Cars Drift","My 2year old loved the chair and frankly so does everyone else, the chair is very comfy, and no too heavy.The chair did come with a broken leg rocker, i contacted the seller who really didn't want to give me a new chair just wanted to send extra legs  to replace the damaged leg.overall the chair is great, very sturdy and holds adults too.",4
Kidkusion Hearth Kushion Taupe,"I tried both the method included and the method suggested by previous users to get this to work, but both fell short.  The enclosed velcro was completely ineffective with adhering to the surface of the fireplace.  It was so bad that the company could probably save money and face by not bothering to include it.  As another user suggested I purchased the Peel N Seal caulk to give it a try to see if I could get better results.  This definitely adhered better than the velcro, but even after a week of letting it dry, my daughter can easily pull the padding off of the hearth.  Unfortunately, we haven't found a better/more cost effective method to protecting her from our fireplace.  If anyone finds one - let us know!",1
"Graco Pack 'n Play Element Playard, Metropolis",bought this pack and play to stay at Grandma's house for all her grandkids and to supplement our more basic pack and play when we come with the twins (at 8 months old they wake each other up if they sleep in the same one) - very nice but I do with the mobile (you have to wind it up like a music box) lasted a bit longer,4
"Real Nappies 6-Pack of Indian Cotton Prefold Cloth Diapers, Infant Size, for babies 3 to 6 months, 11 lb to 20 lb","I recently bought these for my kids to try with their first baby. Although these are not his size yet I&#8217;ve been taking a 'soft sell&#8217; approach on the plusses of cloth over disposables. That said, I used the Nappies for covering a tiny butted baby on his changing table, used them as a burp cloth, used them as a changing pad, soaked them in warm water and covered his hurting tummy. There is no disposable that can do all that as well as diaper a baby! My kids have the all in one cloth as well but for any new mom or dad, a package of these diapers is a must for all the reasons (and ways) I&#8217;ve used them (and now the kids do as well!).",5
Pregnancy Waist Extenders,"These seemed like a good idea but did not work for me. They do keep my pants buttoned, but my expanding pregnant belly also makes it difficult to zip my pants. Using these extenders increases the space between the buttons on my pants, making it even more likely that the zipper will fall down. These might work in very, very early pregnancy, but now that my belly is big enough to keep normal pants from buttoning and zipping, it is just time to move on to maternity clothing. I also found that the extenders are not adjustable enough, so they are either too loose or too tight.",2
Sliding Closet Door Lock 2-Pack,Such a cheap & simple solution to keep your kids safe. I couldn't find these anywhere in stores so I ordered in on Amazon and have been extremely happy with it.,5
Kissaluvs One Size Hybrid Diapers 6Pack COLORS (7-35lbs) - Boy or Girl (Neutral),"At first I was thinking of returning these diapers because I meant to order the new Kissas fitted 2.0 diapers and got these by not reading carefully.  Also, my son was about 9 pounds and they seemed enormous on him.  Then a few short weeks later he was 12 pounds and they fit beautifully, with lots of room as he grows but no longer silly looking.  He stays so dry overnight this has become my favorite overnight diaper; it's almost difficult to be sure he's wet if he only pees once in it.  Not disposable-dry, of course, but for cloth diapers I'm really impressed at how dry it is on the outside against the cover and inside against his skin; the moisture is wicked to the insert away from baby.  They are SO plush and soft, even after several washings (the Kissas fitted diapers seem to get a bit stiff although it's possible I haven't worked all the bugs out of my laundering routine).  I love the way the wings stretch and cross in front for a highly customizable fit that's easier than snaps in the dark.  And the colours -- so beautiful.  It's still quite a bulky diaper so I don't put him in it for daytime when I want him kicking and enjoying a lot of mobility but I do love these diapers.",5

"Disana 100% Organic Merino Wool Knitted Leggings Made in Germany (2-3T, Red)","I use only cloth diapers overnight.  My overnight set up is a bamboo cotton fitted diaper (with inserts) and a 3 layer wool diaper cover, and these knitted leggings over the wool cover.  I use them as pajamas every night on my heavy wetter and if the wool cover ever leaks (rarely does), then it will be caught and soaked up by these leggings.  I don't think these are absorbent enough alone with no other cover.  They do need to be lanolized before use as well.",5
Kidsline Peekaboo Pals Boa Blanket,"Bought this blanket to use for my daughter's daycare.  It's nice and think and super soft, the perfect winter blanket.",5

The First Years Ignite Stroller,My daughter seems very confortable in this stroller and i love it because it is very portable although a little heavier than i wanted but it looks and feels very well made so that outweighs that issue. Very easy to manuver although is a bit hard to push through grass as i have noticed on our trips to the park. One very big con would be that the stroller wheels squeek this wouldnt be a problem if it werent so anoying and very bothersome for my sleeping daughter. The squeeking is why this stroller did not get five stars yes its that annoying i only used this stroller twice when it started squeeking. Overall the stroller is awsome but just wish the wheels wouldnt squeek maybe its just a problem with my stroller but i still dont like itP.SMy daughter is nine months old so no its not a weight problem just in case you thought that,3
Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump,"I have used a manual Medela and electric Lansinoh pumps. I thought, based on my experience with the Medela, that manual pumps were just weak and useless for me. I need good, deep suction. I loved my Lansinoh electric pump, but I couldn't afford another on a tight budget, so I reluctantly settled for the manual Lansinoh.I'm so impressed. I'm able to pump both breasts empty in about 15 minutes, and I can even get an extra letdown then with it after. I could barely get a drop out with the Medela. The manual works as well for me as the electric (both Lansinoh). I love this brand!My pump started squeaking too (on the first day), but I simply used a q-tip to apply dishwashing liquid to the parts that rub together and cause it. It didn't squeak anymore. It should be dry when you apply it. If you don't know which parts I mean, I'm talking about where the handle and flange meet. It creates a sort of hinge for the pumping action. Hope that helps others.",5
The First Years Clean Air Diaper Disposal System,"I bought this at a store about a month ago.  I just read all of the horrible reviews and wanted to share our experience, which is quite different.The only negative I see is that the mechanism is louder than I would like when closing the lid.  I don't think it is quite as extreme as some other reviews have stated because our baby girl doesn't jump or appear startled when closing it.  But it would be nice if it were quieter.  This is the sole reason for taking a star off the rating.After a month of use, we have not had any odor in the nursery at all.  We have two dogs in the house, so the nursery door is always closed.  Even in a closed room, there is no odor at all.Addressing the issues that some others have posted:- The unit is top-heavy, but that has not been an issue for us.  There are two ""openings"" - the lid, so that you can dispose of diapers - and the whole top to change the bag.  Yes, if you open the whole top and let go, it will tip over.  But I have found no reason to do this.  To change the bag, I remove the ring that holds the bag in place, twist the bag with it still in place, and then tie a knot in it.  Then, I just open the whole top and remove the bag while still holding onto the unit.  No problems with it tipping over.  To put in a new bag, just open the mechanism and drop a bag down - no reason to open the whole top again!- As for the child pulling the unit over on them, the unit doesn't pull forward easily (the weight is at the BACK of the top).  While it may not always be possible, we keep it between two pieces of furniture to lessen the chance of a sideways tip.  And not to sound critical, but we watch our kids closely.- As for the fan running or not, I can't tell for certain.  But I can say for sure that the closed room it is kept in does not smell bad at all.  This leads me to believe that the fan is working fine.  If you think about it, the fan only has a small amount of air that it needs to move to clear out the pail.  It doesn't need to spin fast.This is a good diaper pail and we would recommend it to others.",4
"Bright Starts Comfort and Harmony Portable Swing, Florabella","I agree with some of the poor reviews on this swing.Yes, it's compact, BUT:*it's too low to the ground*the music is too loud or too soft*there is absolutely no support - the baby scrunches forward*the pillow provided for head support is absolutely useless*it shuts off after an hour - baby wakes up*worst of all, the upright position is a huge safety hazard - the straps can't keep the baby in and babies are FALLING OUT OF THIS SWING with the straps buckled.I expect to see a recall.",2
"Bright Starts Around We Go Activity Station, Doodle Bugs","I would give this four to five stars, anticipating that it will be quite intriguing for my grandchild. At five months, she sits in the seat fine for a few minutes and loves the little keyboard. She knows the cause and effect of hitting the keys to make music already. She has good strength in her neck but that is the limiting factor for using it now, in addition to height. She needs an adult to stay with her so she does not bump her mouth. Her toes can barely touch the floor, it will be months before she will be able to walk the seat around the table. She cannot reach most of the toys yet. That said, she loves the sound of the flower when I twirl it around and reaches for the many intriguing toys. I think this will be a favorite for baby (and parents) when she is stronger but perhaps it should be advertised for age six months and up instead of four months and up.",5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo,The jumperoo vertical legs did not correctly fit into the base. We were unable to snap it in place. I do not like the poor quality and upon reading other reviews decided to just retun the unit. Frustrating experience after doing all the setup getting to the final step!,1
"Evenflo Compact Fold High Chair, Marianna","I purchased this highchair on behalf of my sister in law.. she has an almost 1 year old boy and needed a high chair. Out of any brick and mortar store, this was the least expensive and surprisingly one of the best high chair's we've come across. Shipping was quick and so was the setup. Literally 10 minutes out of the box the high chair was already up and available for the baby to enjoy.It folds very easy, the colors are for both boys & girls (Parma) and it's extremely easy to clean up. The wheel casters roll very smoothly on the tile floor - so far it's being enjoyed for just arriving the first day.I would definitely recommend this high chair for anyone that needs a good inexpensive highchair for their baby.",5
"Orbit Baby Toddler Car Seat, Mocha","I loved the infant car seat and the carrier. So I got the toddler seat when the baby outgrew his infant seat. I already knew that the toddler seat would be bulky and heavy and would not be ideal for every day strolling. This is true. But as long as the baby is rear facing and we use the carseat base, we have the luxury to not wake him up. But the real benefit I see is with flying. I always buy a seat and put my baby in a carseat when flying. I see no reason to risk his life for money or convenience.  So if you want to put your toddler in a seat, this is a great system. I wheel the seat to the gate, check the strollar base, and get it back at the end of the flight to wheel the seat. I cannot imagine how I would possibly handle flying alone with my baby without this kind of system.One little glitch is that when the shorter loop is attached to the back, the strap gets stuck. This is a real pain. But when I called orbitbaby, they told me to put the strap in the bigger loop, and this resolved this issue. I feel when I pay this much money, they should've work this out. Otherwise I would've given it a 5 star rating.",4
The Shrunks Indoor Toddler Inflatable Travel Bed,"This was a gift sent over seas. They just received it and really love it.I'm so happy. The mother says, since they travel a lot this is perfect.",5
"Carter's 4 Piece Toddler Bed Set, Fire Truck","I really loved the fire truck bed set! The comforter and sheets softened up when I washed them a few times (not that they were really stiff when I got them). Fits the bed well and it did not bleed or fade at all when washed, which concerned me with the red in the sheets! The comforter is not very thick but I like that since I keep the kids bedrooms warmer than the rest of the house. Amazon was the cheapest place that I found this exact comforter set! Definitely would buy again!",5
Flip-Down Child View Mirror,"The mirror does not install easily. The straps simply don't hold the mirror in place. After getting frustrated in my car, I tried to see if the straps would simply hold onto the mirror by itself, and the shape of the hook is all wrong.My wife and I bought two and we'll be returning them both. The flip-down mirror is a neat idea, but this product just doesn't work.",1

Ostart 8 White Baby Furniture Corner Safety Bumper Security Table Desk Corner Edge Protector Guard Cushion Softener,"I had to wait a very VERY long time for these. They came from China. I am glad I ordered them though. Our coffee table has very sharp/pointy corners &#8230; these cover them well. I used some duct tape on them to hold them in place. It is not perfect, but it works. They do not come with anything to hold them in place, probably should &#8230; maybe something that will not cause damage to the furniture. Maybe that is why they don't. I would assume they may not want that responsibility, however, they need something and I used what I had on hand, which was fancy colored duct. lol I just rolled a couple pieces for each cover, so it would be sticky on all sides, place it on the product and pressed it into place. It comes off occasionally, but goes back on easily, and the tape is still sticky.  : ) Great idea for something very concerning to parents : )",5

"Lansinoh mOmma Feeding Bottle, 5 Ounce","Tried these after 4 other kinds of bottles for my daughter before she started daycare @ 12 weeks; she REFUSED bottles at first, and seemed to tolerate these the best. My complaint is the shape--the nipple is the part she seems to like; I don't think the bottle part needs to be round--doesn't fit in the bottle warmer, cup holders, my diaper bag, or the day care fridge. In summation, I like it because my baby likes it, but the shape of the bottle is a pain!!",4
"Tilty Sippy Cup, Clear, 7 Ounce, 2 Pack","If the Tilty cup came with soft tips and handles, this cup would be perfect.  My son has a hard time lifting the cup and prefers softer tipped sippy cups.  Great design though!",3
Vulli Sophie Giraffe Bath Toy - Colors May Vary,"While I didn't really know what to expect regarding this product, it doesn't bother me that it is a hard plastic.  I totally understand that, as it will be in water and when the soft Sophie gets wet, the squeaker doesn't work until it dries out.  It doesn't really bother me that the paint job is less than superior, and it really doesn't bother me that it can in no way shoot water because it is made of hard plastic, despite that it was advertised that it could.  What DOES bother me is that the darn thing doesn't even float upright, as if Sophie's little life ring is keeping her afloat.  She just topples over, and becomes like any other hard plastic toy.  Very disappointed, though we love the soft, original Sophie!",2
Todays Mom Cozy Comfort Pregnancy Pillow - Sky Blue,This is not like sleeping on a cloud.  Very uncomfortable! Material that comes on the pillow is very scratchy feeling and not comfortable.,1
"Bambino Mio Nappy Bucket and Lid, White","I bought this on the recommendation of a friend (who I think would give this 5 stars). We were looking for something to bring diapers to/from daycare, and this is what she uses. I especially liked the idea of not having to wash a wetbag every few days, so we went for it and ordered the nappy bucket. The size is about as I expected from the second photo, if not a little bit bigger. There were so many reviews about it being small, so I actually expected it to be smaller... It IS definitely small compared to most regular diaper pails but I think you could easily fit a day's worth of cloth diapers in here. We use BumGenius 4.0s for daycare and Flips at home. Out of curiosity I just filled it up with clean Flip inserts (mix of the cotton and stay dry, no covers) and I fit 15. Realistically you'd have some covers so the reviewer who said 12 was probably about right. I haven't tried with the 4.0s but I would estimate it would fit 7 or 8. So, depending on what kind of diapers you use, I think it would be adequate if you're washing every day, or maybe every other if you have an older baby going through fewer diapers.As others have mentioned, the lid doesn't really ""lock"" very well. Basically, when the handle is flipped to one side you can't take the lid off. But any older kid could easily flip the handle over - it turns very easily. (so, it might be safe from a baby but not at a daycare with kids of all ages). If that's your plan, might want to see where they (or you) will keep the bucket and if the locking lid is an important feature or not.Overall, I think it's a great little bucket, especially if you're looking for something compact, easy to carry, and are going to wash more frequently. But despite my 4-star review, I am returning it. It was much, much bigger than I wanted just to bring to/from daycare (where she only goes through about 3 diapers). I ordered and just started using a medium Bummis Fabulous Wetbag because they dry faster than the Planet Wise bags we already had.",4

Sparkly Pink Ribbon Pacifier holder (RSP),The only reason not 5 stars is the jewel popped off after two months of use.  Otherwise I got tons of compliments! It is super cute.  Because the clasp is metal it stays on clothes very well which is nice! But it is harder and more pokey than a plastic one so I'm careful about placement.  I would totally recommend this adorable clasp for any mini fashionista ;)!,4

BEABA First Stage Spoon Multi-Pack - Multicolor - 4 pk,"I bought these baby spoons after trying to feed my daughter with the regular rubber-tipped metal spoons. The first time I fed her with the metal ones, she leaned forward at the wrong moment and bonked her little gums - I felt horrible!! But with the Beaba spoons, there's no risk of her hurting her little mouth. They are fantastic -- pliable enough to give if she mouths on the spoon a little, but very durable to withstand her chewing on them. They are also just the absolute perfect angle - unlike the other spoons, which are really pretty flat, these have a little bit deeper spoon well to allow you to actually get food inside little mouths. Highly recommended! I'll be buying the toddler utensils, too.",5
Kimberly Grant Spa Baby Musical Mobile,"I purchased this mobile as an accessory to the Dwell Studio Owl bedding.  The colors match perfectly!  I wasn't crazy over the green arm cover so I decided not to put that on the mobile and left the cream exposed.  There are tags on each square that I had to cut off which was kind of annoying.  Overall, the colors match perfectly to the bedding so I am satisfied.",5
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","My son was 7 months old when he started roaming our living room trying to find things to get into. We immediatley needed something to contain him in for short periods of time when we are cooking, going to the restroom ect. He likes being in his playard for short periods of time, 30 minutes tops. After 30 minutes he wants to pull up on the gate and try to escape. He only weighs 17lbs and the gate gives a little but doesn't seem like it's possible for it to fall because of the way its assembled. It seems sturdy. I put mine as a rectangle as that is how our living room made the most sense, the octagon looks like kids would enjoy it also. I did not have to order the extensions although I thought I would. If you are tight on space and you munchkin is into everything like mine was then this playyard is a must have for being able to take your eyes off your little one for two minutes at a time. I filled it with toys and non toxic foam mats and he was good to go. It's tall enough where even when he is able to stand up there's no way he can get out of there on his own.",4

Safety 1st On-the-Go Fold-Up Booster Seat,"We purchased this booster for our 17 month old little girl because she refuses to sit in a high chair of any kind.  I don't use the attachable tray, we just scoot her right up to the table.  We liked it so much that we bought a second one to keep in the car to use while eating out.  It works great.  It's light weight and easy to set up or break down while dining out.  It doesn't slide around, keeps her fastened and she loves it.",5
Lambs &amp; Ivy Raspberry Swirl Switch Plate Cover,"This was really adorable, it is such a little thing, but we were redecorating our daughter's room and this is so much nicer than the sort of junky tan switch plate cover that everyone has.  It does make a difference, and it is quite sturdy.",5

Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"We bought this at full retail price when our daughter was 7 wks.  She took to it immediately.  But here is the real proof this was worth the$ - she STILL loves it and she's now 8 months old!  We've used it daily since we bought it, just purchased some additional toys to help switch things up.  The only downside was that the parrot spinner started to get rusty after months of her drooling on it.  Even considering that, I would rebuy this gym in a heartbeat.  The quilt has so much to look at and grab.  The self-activated music is a great developmental (cause/effect) tool.  Wonderful wonderful gym.",5

It is pretty but I was concerned about the safety as there are no straps or harness.  I got this and it works great at keeping my son from sliding out and getting up.  Only wish it wiped down or could be rinsed off as he makes a huge mess eating now!,5
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","Perfect fit for Volvo XC-90! I have tinted glasses, but needed a little extra protection from sun light and this product delivers just that. It also add some security. People will not be able to view whats inside the car thru the glass. Just as expected. Well made product. They have not come of since the day I install them 1 year ago. I most certainly recommend, buy with confidence. You will not be disappointed.",5
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","So glad we purchased this Snuzzler! Would recommend to anyone and everyone. Soft, but durable, a nice neutral color to match any theme. Works perfect for any newborn car seat.",5
"Regalo Extra Tall Top of Stair Gate, White","After purchasing and returning SEVERAL top of stairs gates, we finally found one that works with our double banister configuration WITHOUT having to drill into the wood.  I'm giving it only 4 stars because it does shift during normal use, just enough so that it becomes misaligned and both the top and bottom pegs won't go in easily at times.  Just a little readjustment fixes the problem.  It's not difficult, just a little bit of a pain.  But it's worth it to not have to destroy the wooden banister to mount the gate.  I recommend this product.",4
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 6 Pack Soft Bite Infant Spoon, Colors May Vary",I like the size of these spoons for the first months of solids. The soft tip is great for babies who lie to bite.,5
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"The diaper depot is a life saver in our nursery.  It practically has become the most used item besides the diaper genie.  You cannot beat the convience of having everything all together, and especially for the price.  I highly recommend this item.",5
"BABYBJORN High Chair, White","We Love this for my little 4 month old grandson who wants to sit up.  However even though this tray adjusts out, I am sure it will not be able to use for several years to age 3 as suggested.Great compact one piece but for ages 3 months to 15 months. I don't think this will fit most by age 18 months unless they are tiny kids.",4
"Graco Quilted Pack 'n Play Sheet, Light Blue",This did not shrink when I washed and dryed it.  It fits my old pack n play perfectly. My pack n play is from 2005 and it does it's job. great cover.,5
"Under the Nile Organic Cotton Side Snap Baby Tee NB to 6M (NB-3M, Blue)","Fabric is very soft and cozy.  The blue is a very soft blue with a hint of green, so appropriate for either gender.",4
"Britax Car Seat Travel Bag, Black",We put the base in the bag so the bar was at the bottom of the bag. The carseat was not attached to the base it sat in there opposite. The head of the carseat was against the bar. The handle bar fits snugglie over the bar of the base. Then I zipped a little on each side. I was able to do it on my own. Once I was about half way up on both sides I stood the bag up and there was plenty of room to zip it at the top. It was a little tight on the sides. The bag was able to stand up better than the previous review. Hope it works for you. We are planning a trip to Florida and hoping it will last the trip.After the trip- both the carseat and the bag made it safely home.  There was a little wear and tear on the bag but that was expected.  I ended up traveling on my own for the trip with my little one and was able to put the carseat in the bag by myself while my little one was in his stroller.,4
"Joovy Room&sup2; Portable Playard, Red","I wanted to purchase a normal size play pen at first but when I came across this play pen , I thought this is what a play pen should be like. It has plenty of room for my son to play with his toys and walk around in . He has enough room In there to add a playmate . I'm very happy with it . Of course as any playpen you have to set it up and fold it away that's really my complaint which isn't even really a complaint.  It's not as heavy though , which is good. It folds to a small regular size play pen when you put it away! I highly recommend it .",4
Smart Mom Teething Bling Donut Shaped Pendant Necklace (Onyx),made of rubber not stone as thought. my baby loved shewing on this ring when he was teething. only good for a small amount of time. can be worn as a statement piece afterwards.,4
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","I have to admit, while I want my toddler son to grow up tough, I want him protected as his motor skills gets him into places I can't fathom of how to get to or accomplish. I have spent hours in Amazon searching for the easiest and safest protection products.That said, this amazingly simple Door Monkey product is incredible! I use it every day as a Pinch Guard. I place it about a foot above my head and don't take it off whatsoever. Using it this way also PREVENTS my son from closing the door all the way and locking himself in (very scary for a 2 year old).Five star no doubt as it is the easiest child protector I have in the house. No marking, no drilling, no adhesives. It's a must. If the price drops, I'll pick up two more so I can use the door lock feature and not have to worry if my bathroom or bedroom door is closed so I don't walk into toddler surprises (a roll or 3 of toilet paper in the toilet).",5
"timi &amp; leslie Marie Antoinette 7-Piece Diaper Bag Set, Black","This bag holds so much stuff and has many compartments to keep it as organized as possible.  I love the stroller hooks and the size.  It's super stylish too!*UPDATE* Jan. 2014Now, almost 3 years later I am still using my Timi+Leslie Marie Antoinette II Diaper Bag. It is still functioning. Some of the threading has come apart and there is a small hole in one of the inner pockets, after I have washed the bag in the washing machine and put it in the dryer, at least 15 times. It still looks good and works for now two babies. The open top doesn't bother me too much but some might if you stuff it full and it tips over. I am able to put enough diapers, wipes, clothes, burp clothes, binkys, toys, snacks, food or water for me and my wallet, keys and phone and still hold everything. The changing pad is still in great shape, again, that is also able to be washed and dried in laundry machines, great feature! Now, I want to get this bag in the jewel tones, they are gorgeous.",5
Vullie Sophie Giraffe and Pie Pink - Natural Rubber and Food Paint Details Set of 2,"Be aware before purchasing from this vendor.  The items arrived in damaged packaging, and the Chan Blue looked dirty as if it was not new.  I purchased these as gifts and was really embarrassed to even give them as gifts looking the way they did.  The vendor sent these in an envelope rather than a box.I was very unhappy and the vendor was not very accomodating with my dissatisfaction with their service.",1

"Sunshine Kids Radian65 SL Convertible Car Seat, Champagne","I drive a 2001 gmc yukon and I have four kids under 65lbs and in 5 point harnesses! it imposssible for most car seats to be installed correctlly in my yukon! I have tried many seats but only the Britax seats are safe in my yukon. what I'm saying is most of the time the car is the problem not the car seat. I love how this seat is narrow, folds up,high quality and can use the lach up to 65lbs and cost less then the Britaxes. my 5 year old 44lb son is not safe in my option in a booster I will keep my kids in 5 point harnesses until 65lbs!  it is very narrow if you need three accross. not a lote of side protection on this model. it really takes up a lote of room when rear insalled but fits inbetween the two front bucket seats anyway. seems high quallity wish it would have worked out. in my option this seat only installed correcly with the latch system and had very poor installation with the seatbelt.",5
Squatty Potty 7&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"Let's face it, sitting on a toilet isn't a truly natural body position for one to be in while using the bathroom. Only with the invention of the toilet within 'Civilized Society' did this idea and repetitive engagement take root as correct. The Squatty Potty positions its user to be in the optimal position while going to the bathroom. The truth is that as men age one of the many health scares facing us is of colon related illness. Research concerning the need to improve colon health can be found more and more places as the incidences of colon related health issues rise.Purchasing a squatty potty is proactive measure, plain and simple. It goes to support healthy elimination which reinforces colon health (The core of the immune system).As a result the Squatty Potty earns its money the first time you utilize it. You can feel the difference in the completeness of each movement which is ideal for everyone. After a long period using the squatty potty I have noticed a major difference in how I feel holistically.This was a personal purchase, based on intentional proactive health measures. I want to do those healthy things in my life to ensure my healthy aging and squatty potty helps me to do so.Its a great product and I highly recommend it.",5
"Tommee Tippee Milk Feeding Bib, Colors May Vary, 2-Count",These are my favorite bibs and I always reach for these first because they catch the dribbles.  When I have to use my other bibs because I've already gone through these (I only have 4) the collar of her outfit always ends up wet from the dribbles that go down the neck and under the bib.,5
Summer Infant Nasal Aspirator !,"You will just love this product!!!  It was on my baby registry and over a year later I still use it and love it!!!  It creates this air-tight suction without getting far into baby's nostrils (like the hospital aspirator).  You get to see all that gooey stuff through the clear top and then when you are finished you just twist open and rinse in warm water.  Another great feature is that it grows with baby from infancy to toddlerhood.  Although a challenge to find in stores, Summer infant nasal aspirator is great and worth every penny!!!",5
"Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Toddler Size 2 - Pack of 2 (Blue, White)","I clean these by placing in the dishwasher.  For your cloth diaper stash, bur 4 of these.

Mid City Tote - Diaper Bag,"I loved this bag!  I am not the baby so I did not want to carry around a baby print bag.  Unfortunately this bag did not hold up...  The strap litterally just pulled out on one side.  There was no unusual wear and tear on this bag, in fact we had another diaper bag we used as well so this one wasn't even used everyday.  I am dissapointed that this bag barely made it past my little one's 6 mos bday...",3
Batya Infant Soft Bather - Green,"I used this from birth to 6 months. Then I switch to a dream baby bath seat which I also recommend. The baths cradles the baby very well. I will say the picture of the baby floating next to the brother/sister is unrealistic,you need to help it balance with a hand or foot.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"Larger than some other baby gyms, Great value for the price. Bright colors and space for the baby to move freely in play. Highly recommend this product.",5

Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,"I bought this for my five month old twins.  The love watching it roll.  As it rolls, each piece opens and closes.  It also has mirrors inside as it rolls which is visually stimulating.  The outside of the ball is textured, which is physically stimulating.",5
Munchkin 4 Pack White Hot Safety Spoon,Great spoons for the little one. They are more shallow than some of the other infant spoons so easier for them to use their lips to get the food off of the spoon. The safety feature of changing colors is a nice addition touch.,5
Adhesive Mount Cabinet/Drawer Lock,we bought some that need to be screwed in which is really hard to do on thinner cabinet wood and at the angle the cabinets are at.  so we bought these stick on ones and they work and are soooooo much easier to install.,5
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado","We purchased this pail liner for cloth diapers in the bathroom. I didn't want a stinky bathroom and the lid on the trash can we purchased (basic $10 step-pedal trash can from Wal-Mart) seems to work fine at helping this bag contain any smells. It's very waterproof. We have never had a single problem with leaks. We've had this bag for two years and just purchased another for another bathroom. It has held up very well after washing. We toss the bag and everything in it in the washer (empty it out into the washer just to be sure everything gets washed, then drop the bag in after) and hang it to dry. I don't recommend putting it in the dryer.",5

Hands-Free Baby Bottle Holders for Twins (Monkey and Kitten),"Looking forward to trying this item now as the twins are two months old ... Any younger, I would not recommend...I love feeding newborns myself....However getting ready for work in the morning this may be a Godsend....Also necessary to keep them on the same feeding schedule....I am the Grandma, and think I need this when I am watching them!!!Ha Ha !!!!",5
Sumersault Playful Puppies Mobile,We have found this mobile to be excellent for our son's room.  He finds it very entertaining as well!,5
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,"This truly is one of my favorite products. I make a days worth of formula in 5 mins. Very easy to use, clean. It has made my baby's gas and spitting up almost non existent when used with the dr brown's bottles. I will be getting this for mom's to be if I know they will be formula feeding.",5
Kate Aspen 4 Piece Chic Cheetah Animal-Print Purse Manicure Set,"This little gift did great for young girls.  Makes a great little stocking stuffer or niece gift.  I call them, JUST BECAUSE gifts. Really cute gift.",4
Evenflo Snugli Front &amp; Back Pack Carrier,"This carrier is way too bulky and a complete pain to put on.  I registered for it after reading some favorable reviews but wish I didn't.  I am going to try another brand.  If your baby is small you have to pull all the straps so much that you have tons of things dangling all over the place.  It is hard to get her in and out of it without major disruption to her, and no matter how I adjust it the left shoulder continually slips for me.  It is also too small in the waist adjustment for my husband who is a pretty big guy. I thought the Bjorn carriers were overpriced but I am going to try another brand.  Very disappointed.",2
"Britax Boulevard 70 CS Convertible Car Seat, Biscotti","This car seat is so hot! My poor little toddler was soaked when she got out. If you live in a southern or desert climate, I do not recommend this car seat.",1
"Pepperpot Baby Record Book, Molly's Nursery",I purchased this one as a gift after using a similar one from Pepperpot for my own pregnancy.  Both were great and I would recommend to anyone who is pregnant and wants to record those precious 10 months.,5

We Sell Mats 36 Sq Ft Alphabet and Number Floor Mat,"I was looking for a mat that would work for my son to crawl on since we have hard wood flooring - it does that perfectly plus will double as an educational tool for him.  I had to admit, I was a little leary purchasing this as it said &#34;open box&#34; as the condtion of the item but it was brand new, only the plastic that encased it was open a little. Love this!!",5
Fisher-Price Table Time Turtle Booster,We got this little chair because we needed to entertain my niece at our house for a few days.  She gravitated right to it.  Glad amazon has these great deals because something similar costed 20 more dollars at the toy store near us.,5
Trend Lab Two Picture Frame Set in Paisley Park,I got this for a friend I went to school with who is due any day now and was going for a rockstar themed room for her son.  The package arrived when expected.  She loves them and can't wait to put pictures of her son in them!,4

"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel",Ergo is perfectly comfortable for both me and baby!  I love it already and baby is only 3 weeks old.,5
"Munchkin Mighty Grip Trainer Cup 2-Pack, 8 oz, Colors Vary","I started using these when my baby was a little over 1 year old, and this is her favorite sippy cup because it is easy to drink from.  My daughter does not like sippy cups with a hard spout because they are harder to suck.  I like them because they do not leak, look nice, come in an 8 oz. size with handles, and a larger 10 oz. size without handles (with a spout or a straw).  The pieces are interchangeable between the different sizes, except that the straw, which only fits the 10 oz. bottle because it is long.The only caveat is that in 6 months, she has managed to rip the hole in two of the silicone spouts.  That said, the silicone valve that comes with hard spout cups can also rip.  I ordered replacement soft spouts at $1.50 each by simply calling the manufacturer Munchkin.  Their online web store has not functioned in a week, and it incorrectly says that the spouts are on back order, so it is better to call their toll-free number.Overall, I am very happy with this product.",5
"Comotomo Silicone Baby Teether, Blue","I would recommend this to anyone, our 6 month old loves this teether!  It is easy to clean, easy for him to hold and every inch of it is useable for him.",5
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","I use in the carseat and stroller for my three months old baby. She is big for her age and it fits nice,y. It has two faces one for summer and one for winter. It makes the carseat and stroller more comfortable.",5
"Waterproof Baby Bibs with Snaps for Girls &amp; Boys, Gift Box 10 Pack, Solid Colors",These bibs are great.  Love the snaps.  They are waterproof.  Keeps my baby dry.  Wonderful gift box.  I saved the box to store pictures in.  Recommend for anyone needing baby bibs.  Also neck size fits my baby. Some bibs do not fit as the neck is to small.  No problem with fitting.,5
BooginHead SplatMat Protective Floor Mat ~ Brown Flourish,"This was a very pretty mat, and I like the fact that it did not look so babyish. However, I think the mat should be of a more durable plastic. Not something so pliable and floppy. We bought this to protect out carpet, but ended up just buying a computer chair mat and using that isntead. It would stay flat and flush with the carpet, which prevented trips and falls, unlike the Splat Mat...",2
The First Years Disney Pooh Soft Potty Seat,"dont love it, doesnt fit securely on toilet seat. my son slipped off a few times. it has a cute car design that excites my son but i feel it isnt safe",3
"Graco Blossom 4-In-1 Seating System, Sapphire","My baby fit perfect in here from 4mos up as opposed to another chair where the tray was at her nose. And she is super comfortable in it, whether while eating or watching me cook or just to hang out. Love how easy the tray comes off and the seat reclines. Easy clean up. And just super cool in general to have so many seating options available from one high chair. Only down is that it doesn't fold up. Which is ok with me but might be a necessity for others. Another plus- My 14 mo nephew came to visit and we only have one highchair but...we were able to use the booster seat for him while my daughter used the highchair.",5
"Quinny Buzz Cup Holder, Black",Really Quinny could have put a little more thought on the accessories. This cup holder is hooked at a weird place on the rods of the stroller. I'm worried once my baby is old enough she might be able to grab it while sitting in the stroller.,3
Surprise Sunrise - Baby Month Onesie Stickers,"These are sooo cute, and very vibrant! We love these stickers, I wish I had them earlier so I could use the ""0"" sticker =)",5
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Diaper Pail, White",This product is completely serves the purpose and at 25 its very reasonably priced. I've had it for 2 months and so far its been working. The lid design could have been better as you have to 'push' the button down at the same place where you have to pull the lid to open. Kind of counter intuitive. Like other reviewers mentioned a foot pedal would have been perfect. The bags are perfect fit and there is no tying etc. Its easy to use and lasts for a week or so (with a 2 month old baby).,4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,my kids love this music cube.  they love it so much that I started to get this product for my friends' children or babies.  the music and the lights keep them entertained.,5

Fisher-Price Adorable Animals Baby's Bouncer,My baby loves this bouncer! It was easy to assemble and is easy to take apart to wash. It is also light and easy to move room to room.,5
Sensible Lines Milk Trays,"I love the fact that milk is frozen in one ounce quantities.  This means you thaw out exactly what you need...you never waste an ounce!  You do have to wash by hand, and sometimes it's difficult to pop frozen milk out of the tray, but overall I like it much more than the plastic bag storage systems that are more common.  It is also much more environmentally friendly, since you can store many ounces of frozen milk in quart ziploc bags instead of throwing away milk storage bags every three ounces.",5
Tiny Love Super Mat,"This is a fine mat with one big caveat. Anyone who has or is planning to purchase this mat please be aware of the STRING that holds the leaf teether. Before I thought the string was not long enough to be a strangulation hazard, but it is!  Today my very active son was rolling around the mat, kind of lifting the mat, and the string got around his neck. I heard him wimper and when I looked over the leaf was under him and he was struggling the wrong way, making it tighter. If you use this mat, remove the string first!",2
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",i had originally did not wish to buy a swing for my daughter because my son never used his and it was a waste of money and space. but the last few weeks of pregnancy i got antsy sitting at home and decided to look into different swings and possibly getting one. I saw this swing on babiesrus.com and babydepot.com not this exact one but plenty like it. I fell in love. Then i read reviews which are not great at all. Of course everything has its pros and cons. I finally decided this swing was the one i wanted and was going to take the chance on it. I went to baby depot to get it and they were out of stock and would take 8 weeks to get it. I couldn't wait that long so i went on to their website and went to order it and saw that it was another 30 dollars to have it shipped! fed up i took it to my facebook where my best friend who is an avid amazon shopper found the swing for me and not only was it 50 dollars cheaper then in stores but it had free shipping! No major problems with the swing other than sometimes speeds 1 and 2 dont work at first but if i put it on 3 which isnt that fast of a speed the first two will work. easily  put together *no help from my husband* and perfect for my daughter!,5
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","This is such a cool idea.  No more awkward plastic baby bath tubs.  This is pillow like, but firm.  After bath time it has a hook to hang it to drip dry in the tub.  It seems that it would be easier to bathe baby in this and more comfortable too.",5
"Padalily The Original Car Seat Handle Cushion, Pink Swurvy Chevron","I've tried quite a few padded car seat handles, and this was by far the best one! Its also the nicest looking. I've tried the JJ Cole one, which was much too small and always rotated so that the padding was on the top. Same with the Boppy brand one. This one is awesome because it has padding all the way around. It also rotates, but that doesn't matter because of the padding. Its also great quality and looks really nice. The rings for the toys are a great touch. I get a ton of compliments on it. I was really hestiant to spend almost $30, but its been worth it!",5
"Boon Flair Pedestal Highchair with Pneumatic Lift,White/Orang","We love the boon flair pedestal high chair, if you going to feed a toddler , this is best high chair,it is so easy to clean after each feeding , I can't imagine how I would have had to clean those other chairs.The Boon is great because it moves (rolls)Boon Flair Pedestal High Chair with Pneumatic Lift, Coconut Seat/Blue Raspberry Padanywhere around the  house you want to go (on carpet it's a little hard). Another great feature is the adjustable height .one hand removable tray and it looks Great  ! Everyone loves it ,it's diffinate a conversation piece .",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"My daughter is 3 1/2 years old - when I bought this stroller and she is about 3'2&#34; tall.  I was looking for a umbrella stroller that was for a bigger kid.  This stroller was perfect, it moves easy, the handles are tall enough so I am not hunched over when I push her, it folds open and closes very easy.  I love the pouch at the top for keys, phone, money..etc and the cup holder.  The bottom basket is just okay - its hard to put things in the basket because the frame from the stroller is in the way.  But you can put a jacket or something that can fold easy into the basket.  My daughter fits in the stroller with room to spare, she likes being in this stroller - she calls it her big girl stroller.  I did a lot of research on strollers before I bought this one and some people may think its pricey for a umbrella stroller, but to me it was worth it, because this is a upgraded umbrella stroller.  I love it an would recommend it to anyone looking for a stroller for a older child.  I did not give the stroller a 5 star only because of the basket.",4
"Dreambaby Banister Gate Adaptors, Silver","worked for our stairs. Its exactly as advertised for us. Price is very good as well.  If you have a baby gate and stairs with spindles, you need these.",5

"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack",We looked at many hooks to hang our diaper bag from the handle of our stroller and I'm thrilled that we decided to go with these metal hooks.  They've held on great and don't even flinch when we hang a huge diaper bag from them.  Thrilled with our purchase.,5

"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso","We had high hopes for this crib, and those hopes were dashed when we received it.First of all, we selected the color &#34;Walnut&#34; based on the product images provided by amazon. Please be forewarned that the &#34;walnut&#34; color is not a brown color at all - if anything, the wood stain is a deep red, more properly titled &#34;cherry&#34; instead of &#34;walnut&#34;.Secondly, once we completely opened up the packaging, we discovered that several of the pieces were damaged. The headboard was split and the sideboard had deep gauges in the wood.This crib will be going back ASAP and our search for a crib continues...",2
The First Years All Purpose Steam Sterilizer,"I had purchased this sterilizer based on a recommendation from a friend.  After just a few uses, the steamer stopped working.  When the lever to turn the steamer on was pushed, it just wouldn't turn on any more.  I contacted the First Years manufacturer, and to say the least, they did have excellent customer service.  They had no problem replacing the unit.  Upon receiving the second unit, I used the steamer once.  And because the steamer couldn't hold every thing on the first run I had to run it twice in a row.  To my disappointment, I pressed the lever and again it did not work.  Frustratingly, I pushed the lever several times and then the light finally came on.  Unless you cool it for about a half hour or more, this is how my unit operated.  I'm sure that not every one's experience is the same but this was how mine was.  I definitely would caution buyers on the product - only because this problem occured twice with the units that I have used.",1

"Boon Catch Bowl with Spill Catcher,Blue/Orange",This has been our favorite bowl for every meal for my daughter who is now 2.5.  We haven't had any warping issues in the dish washer like other reviewers but we always put it on the top rack and set it to air dry to save energy.  I had another bowl with a suction cup that completely melted in our dishwasher though so I think this one is pretty tough.  My daughter loves the bowl and the lip is great for catching oatmeal and pasta that falls off the utensils as they are learning motor skills. One of our most used meal items.,5
"The First Years Spinning Drying Rack, White",I love this product as this is a nice way to organize the bottles and nipples and other parts of the feeding system.,5
The Art of CureTM Baltic Amber Teething Necklace - Rainbow Mom &amp; Baby Set w/ &quot;The Art of Cure&quot; Jewelry Pouch-TM (SOLD AND SHIPS FROM USA),"My mom got this set for us both when baby was around 5-6 mos. and my daughter has been wearing ever since! Never taken off her, doesn't bother her nor so I have fear of choking-it's safe. My necklace did end up breaking on the clasp part where the beads meet is a peg plastic screw like insert that goes into receiving end, making it invincible as you don't see any strings hanging its very nice classy looking lightweight. But for some reason, not sure if baby pulled on mine too hard or what but the plastic screw insert part that holds the whole piece together broke out of its socket so we glued it back in, in order to clasp together so I can still wear! Other than that, I believe it's properties are working given my girl has so many teeth! We've never given her any medicine for teething nor does she take pacifiers! The amber does the job! If anything else we get tons of compliments saying how cute and stylish she is with her necklace what a diva! haha then I explain no its not an accessory theres a reason--the whole amber thing!",4
BUILT NY Munchler Lunch Bag - Meadow,"My daughter received the Dog lunch bag to use as a snack bag on her first day of playgroup.  The first time my petite 4 yo tried to unzip her new Dog lunch bag, the zipper broke in half leaving a sharp stub.  She still loves it because it's so cute, so I covered the sharp part with electrical tape.  Now, after having used this for almost a year, the corners are starting to crack.  As much as this product costs, it should be made with materials strong enough to withstand a 4yo's tiny fingers.  I wish I had gotten a bento box instead.If you're still thinking of buying this, the dog size can hold a half sandwich, an orange or apple and a yogurt, no problem.  If you need to pack a full lunch for an older child including a drink, it'll be a tight squeeze, if possible at all.",2
The First Years Breastflow Milk Storage Organizer,This truly helped organized the freezer.  Flattening the bags makes thawing exponentially easier.  I would recommend this highly to any family with a breast feeder.,5
RSVP Endurance Stainless Steel Food Mill,Delivery was prompt. Easy to install blades and clean up a snap.  All in all very satisfied with this purchase.  Would highly recommend this product.,5
"American Baby Company Value Jersey Knit Bassinet Sheet - 2 Pack, Celery",I got what I paid for.. they r not high quality.. but to be used on a bassinette mattress .. they will serve the purpose. I bought 2... they  r  NOT identical..one fits better than the other..,3
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,"What the others say about the time savings and efficiency of this pump is true.  This is the best pump for you or your spouse.Without a doubt, this is the biggest no brainer in the history of birth!",5
"Baby Brezza One Step Baby Food Maker, White/Grey","I have been buying the plum baby organics food pouches (which I still love) and thought I could try making homemade baby food to give my baby different combos of food that the pouches and other store brands didn't offer. I have had every machine (Baby Beaba, Baby Bullet and Baby Chef) and they were all returned. Finally I found the Brezza! Super easy to use, has a great steam option (which was what I missed in the baby bullet) and easy to clean. Couldn't be happier with this product and now I can make fun food combos. Also, I usually buy products from Amazon however this time I bought from Babies R Us.  They were running a special where if you bought the food maker you got the spatula and cutting board attachment for free.",5
Sassy Teething Tail Fish,"Easy to hold, can generate conversations about the fish.  Nice shape for little hands.  Waiting to see if grandson see it as a favorite.",3
"Graco Ready2Grow Classic Connect LX Stroller, Metropolis","The part that attracted me about this stroller model was that it was marketed as flexible enough to handle kids as they grew, with ""12 seating positions"" and that it was for Graco's Classic Connect line of car seats.  When we discovered we were pregnant with our daughter barely 8 months after our son was born, I thought it was a perfect chance to reuse some admittedly expensive equipment.  Since my son outgrew the Graco car seat, we at least had another opportunity to use it again.  I went seeking Graco double strollers specifically for that reason and didn't consider any other manufacturer.The R2G seems attractive because it appeared to offer the most flexibility and potential longevity (our children have some developmental delays, so they won't likely be walking on their own until much later than other typical children their age).  The ""12 positions"" seemed particularly attractive.But what that doesn't say is that the diagrams clearly show multiple instances of the SAME positions but with differently sized children.  The seat and child configurations themselves are no different.The reality is that there are 8 different possible combinations, not 12.  Also, the configuration diagram in the back of the instruction manual is not accurate -- the scale is different from the actual product, and implies that the stroller is larger than it actually is.  When I place the Classic Connect car seat in the back position, my son is pressed up against the tray in the front seat, to the point where I can't lift him out unless I remove or disconnect the tray.  Thus, I put him in the back seat, and my daughter in the front, with both of them rear-facing, like in a shopping cart.In essence, the real product is shorter in both length and height than the diagrams in the manuals depict.  There are 8 distinct positions, not 12 (because again, two differently sized children sitting in the same seat in the same facing is NOT two different positions).  And yes, this stroller does handle like the Queen Mary II, the foot brake and tray are in a very awkward position that my 5'1"" wife constantly seems to accidentally kick, as do I even though I know about it (and I'm 5'8"").It does fit well in the back of my 2008 Ford Escape, but it is awkward to handle.  I also wish the restraining clip that keeps it from unfolding accidentally was a different color than the rest of the stroller; we have a single-seat Graco stroller that is constructed similarly, and its clip is red while the rest of the stroller is blue, making it very easy to see.  The black-on-black of this R2G makes the clip difficult to see, and while I like to see myself as an involved father, I'm not using this stroller every day such that I remember which side the clip is on.Overall, it's a decent enough product and meets our needs.  It does not, however, exceed our expectations to where we're singing its praises from the tops of mountains.  We bought this R2G because we had to, and we'll continue to use it until our kids are grown enough to no longer need a stroller.  But I would caution other new parents to consider other options first for double strollers.",2
"Kid'Sleep Classic, Blue","This bunny alarm clock for kids is amazing!!  Our 2-year-old son loves waking up in the morning and seeing the bunny wake up too.  He always says, ""Mommy, the bunny is awake and that means I can get up!""  He understood right away after we explained to him that he could not get out of bed in the morning unless the bunny was awake.  It was a success the 1st night!!  Such a great purchase - I would recommend this to anyone with an early riser like my little boy!  We've had it for about 2 months now and I can honestly say it still works great and my son loves his bunny clock!  We use it for naps and morning wake-up.  Worth every penny.  Very easy set-up.",5
"Pearhead Sonogram Frame, Black","I absolutely love this frame, it is beautiful! I was surprised when I received it to see that there were actually several different sayings you can put in the little window, I liked 'coming soon' the best, and they each come in either blue or pink. I definately recommend it for anyone who's expecting, or knows someone that is!",5
Yookidoo Flow 'N Fill Spout Bath Toy (9m+),"This spout is so much fun! My 18 month old is fascinated with running water and this is a wonderful way for her to play in the running water without waste and without me having to sit there and pour! She loves the peek a boo cups as well....even learned to say """"peek a boo"""" playing with this toy. Highly recommended.UPDATE..I dropped from 5 stars to 3 stars...it is only a couple of months later....thought the batteries needed to be replaced...nope...it simply stopped working. I suspect there is a problem in the switch. There is no corrosion inside the battery compartment. Started having trouble with the switch a month ago...would not stay on unless held the switch down...took it out of the tub for a couple weeks post-op because couldn't have the water deep enough. Put it back and no longer works. Very bummed. Was a great toy while it lasted.",3

"Soothing Dreams Monistor with Remote Control, Fisher-Price","I purchased this monitor, mainly because of the neat features and because of the manufacture.  The features of this product are wonderful but the main idea of a monitor is to be able to hear your baby when you are not in the same room.  The receiver makes a horrible loud clicking sound making it nearly impossible to hear the baby.  It also becomes very annoying when you are trying to sleep not only because the clicking noice keeps you awake but the fact that you are not sure if it is picking up noises your baby may be making. I returned the product immediately and purchased a cheaper Fisher Price Monitor called Sounds N' Lights and it works fine.  The Soothing Dreams Monitor would be great if Fisher Price could fix the bugs in it.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.",2
"Dreambaby Swing Closed Security Gate, White","I think this is a great safety gate, especially for the price.We bought this for the nursery, so we can leave the door open but keep the dogs out of the room. The gate installs really easily -- it took my husband a few minutes max -- and it looks better than some safety gates. The auto-close feature is a good idea for a safety gate, but it would be nice if you could disable it somehow. It does get annoying if I am just running in and out of the nursery and don't want it to close behind me.My biggest complaint, however, is the thumb latch that opens the gate. It's not the easiest to use. You have to slide it back and pull upwards at the same time, which is not impossible, but sometimes it feels 'stuck' and you have to do the motion again. It is not a huge deal, but it does get annoying.Even with those complaints, I still would recommend this gate -- especially if you are going to use it for a room or doorway that you don't go in and out of very often.",4
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","OK, I'm not a &quot;stuff&quot; person.  When we had our new baby, everyone tried to give us baby items, most of which we politely declined.  We figured if our moms raised us without a bunch of designed-just-for-baby gear, we could too.  Then came bath time for our 6 week old.  Not good.  She HATED it and cried so much that we just stopped doing baths all together.  After much research, I bought the Safer Bather.  Voila!  Instant fix.  She now loves the bath and has one every night.  It dries quickly, takes up very little space and most of all keeps the baby warm and comfy.  Great product - even other &quot;baby minimalists&quot; should invest in this one.",5
"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer","I have never written a review for any product before, but I am so pleased with this thermometer that I felt I had to. We have used two other thermometers for our baby's bath water and they have both malfunctioned. I decided to try this one because of the great reviews. I could not be more pleased. It functions exactly as the descripion says.",5
"Light Pink Zebra - Leg Warmers - for my Infant, Baby, Toddler, Little Girl or Boy","I bought these for my 7 yr grand daughter for Christmas and she LOVED them!

"Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey","Easy to use, my son likes it. Unfortunately the suction cups on the bottom don't stick well and then broke off all together after the second of third use. It gets nicks in it from my son pinching the edges with his thumbnail, but it keeps him from falling in.  If I had to do it over again I wouldn't buy this. I would shell out a bit more for a higher quality one.",3
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"Works awesome!  My daughter prefers this greatly to the bulb.  I also kind of like that it grosses everyone out...including other moms and my mom.  :)  There really isn't anything to be grossed out about.  I doubt the filter is even necessary as the suction you get is not enough to suck it through the first tube, let alone both of them!",5
"Contours Lite Stroller, Tangerine","My daughter is 8 months now and we've had this stroller since she was born.  It was a little ill fitting for a newborn (she was 7 lbs), but she quickly grew into it.  It's very easy to steer with one hand and tall enough for my husband (who is 5'11) to push without having to hunch.  It has lasted well with daily use around the neighborhood.  The wheels are plastic, not rubber, so you have to be careful what surfaces you go on so that the tires don't gum up.  I haven't had any problems, but I have avoided gravel to be on the safe side.  The cup holder is pretty much totally worthless and we never use it.  The snack tray is waaay to far from her arms reach and we never use that either.  I love the 5 point harness and that there is plenty of room for storage underneath.  It's a good stroller and I think it will last us for years.",4
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I own Medela's Pump in Style Electric BreastPump, use and like it a lot, but I needed to buy a small one for travel - so I got Medela Harmony manual breastpump. It works as well as my electric one, and I think that I got milk flow even faster. The best part - I can control pumping at my comfort level, which is awesome!I do not think it is the best option if you have to pump a lot, but for occasional job it is great. I did read reviews for different pumps everywhere before I picked this one, and I'm very happy with it. Easy to assemble, no leaks, comfortable, does excellent job! Very lightweight, so I do not have to drag my big electric one around (I travel a bit).I wish I got it sooner!",5
"Zoli Gummy Sticks Baby Gum Massagers, Green/Orange",This was exactly what I was looking for to help relieve my son's back molar pains. He was chewing on his fingers and now he can chew on this and he loves it. It fits perfectly in his mouth ( he is 15 months old) and the handle is just the right size for his hand to grasp. Highly recommend this product for any teething toddler!,5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","I got these to try while pregnant, as I had some issues and needed ointment. They worked great for containing ointment stains, but these aren't the greatest for absorbency. While I commend the company for trying to help minimize waste, these aren't great. I leak through these quicker than any disposables I've tried. I'm not a heavy leaker, usually only dripping if feeding has been prolonged, but I usually go through all 3 pairs (6 pads) in less than 48 hours. They also shrank a bit in the dryer and are noticeable under un-padded or thin bras. I'll use them around the house, or maybe as a liner for disposables if I'm going to be out for awhile and want extra protection, but I have no intentions on stocking up on these.",2
"Tiny Love Soothe 'n Groove Mobile, Blue","I love this mobile. My son loves this mobile. My only issue is that even on the lowest setting, the volume of the music is ridiculously loud. When my son was an infant, I solved the problem by covering both speakers with a piece of duct tape. Now that he is sitting, I would be afraid that he'd be able to peel the duct tape off and get himself into trouble, so I detached the upper mobile and removed the lower unit from his crib, setting it on his dresser instead. He can still listen to the music and I can feel comfortable leaving the duct tape over the speakers.",4
"HALO 100% Cotton Muslin Sleepsack Swaddle, Gator Plaid, Newborn",My daughter loves this and the lightweight is great for the summer! Sleepsacks are a must for all babies! Seriously!,5
"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","I don't usually write reviews, but I'm really upset we spend $65 dollars on a gate that fell apart, after the eligible date to return it.  I bought this last June, when my daughter was 6 months, and I didn't install it until January.  I've been using it for less than 3 months, and the door broke.  Initially I was really pleased with the products, but don't waste your money.  The hinge just snapped off when my husband tried to open it.  For less than 3 months of use that is really unexceptable.",1
La Leche League International Intimates Hands Free Pump Bra 32 D Bodynude,"I bought this bra in 2011 and I love it, because I could wear it all day and pump any time. I would recommend it to any working and nursing moms. I use it with Medela detachable cups.",5
Dapper Snapper Baby &amp; Toddler Adjustable Belt ~ Hot Pink,"Love this, we use it on our daughter's jeans and it works just as expected and looks adorable too.  Since it's on the back it doesn't get dirty either so we're able to use it on all of her jeans.",5
Stork Craft Rochester Stages Crib with Drawer,"I recently purchased this crib for my impending bundle of joy.  It didn't take long to assemble... maybe an hour... looks absolutely beautiful.  My only issues with it are that some parts came damaged.  One part used for doing the daybed has a big gouge in it.  Also the railing had a scratch on it.  We turned it the other way and you can't see it though.  Also, the drop rail is a little hard to drop down for me.  My husband seems to have no problems, but it's challenging for me.  Also, the platform that the mattress sets on seems rather flimsy and not very sturdy, so I may re-enforce it later... I'll decide when I actually have a mattress to put in there.  It IS very pretty though and overall I'm pleased.",4
DUSIEC Baby Carrier 4 way Infant Carriers Papoose Baby sling,"You know, one day while sitting in my lounge chair reading a book my little nursing crawled up to me and I picked her up and we nursed like we normally do. While she was nursing for the whole 2 minutes (she's one of those quickie-snack-throughout-the-day nurslings) I thought to myself, ""Self, what would make this better?"" Then I thought, ""hmmm if only I had a contraption that could sling her onto my hip and cover her head (I mean, who really wants to lovingly coo and cuddle with a baby after all)... Well, that would be perfect!"" Then I got to searching and found this beaut of a carrier! So perfect. Now, when I need to nurse her, I first get out my ""tool belt nurse-o-rama"", I untangle the straps, hook it onto me, shhhhhing the baby fussing while waiting, get the straps adjusted and slide baby in so I can look down at her just like a lil leech sucking while hanging off my body. If I'm feeling extra cuddly I use the horizontal ""mummy"" position but normally, I've got sh$@ to do so she's gotta just hang there and do her thang while mamma gets her work done. After she's done I wrangle us out of it, give her a big ol smacky poo on her diaperbutt (as a way to say ""way to go lil sucker!"") and send her on her way! We usually repeat this about 10 times a day. Im so glad I have my ""tool belt nurse-o-rama"" or I just wouldn't survive my day!",1

Summer Infant Extra Camera For Day and Night Flat Screen Color Video Monitor,"I purchaced the Summer Infant Monitor Complete Care package and was disapointed when I couldn't find an extra camera to purchace for it.  I searched all over the internet for which camera to buy as the addition.  I even read a few reviews that said there was not a compatible camera!  I finally called customer service and they dircted me to this camera.  I was so happy when it worked!  I am now able to have a camera at each area where my daughter naps/sleeps, use the 7"" monitor in the bedroom at night and the handheld during the day.  Now if they would only make a function on it that would scan between the two camera's......that would be great for a two child house!",5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"We got this as a gift at our shower.  It quickly became my families first choice.  From the beginning it was great to help our daughter sleep when she is fussy.  She loves to swing.  We bring it with us when ever we travel.  Of all the choices of things to entertain our daughter this one continutes to be No. 1.I love all the options that this swing has: different sounds, lights, swing directions, speeds, etc.I cannot say enough great things about this swing.  The only downside is that the mobile stopped rotating.  I wish that the purchaser had gotten the protection plan...",4
Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,"My 3 month old was waking up constantly all through the night. At the best she would sleep straight for 5 hours til around midnight and then up every 1-2 hours after that til 6am. The very first night I used the magic sleep suit she slept from 7:30 to 7:00am and only woke up twice- 12:30,4:30! Since then we have used it for a month and I use it for her naps too- she falls asleep sooo easily now, no more rocking her. She also only wakes up 1,2 times a night and has started sleeping in later too. I would give this product 5 stars except there have still been a spurts of waking up 3,4 times a night so it's not a perfect fool proof fix but I wouldn't dare give up this suit for anything!!!! And no, it's not too hot she has never woken up sweaty once. It really does just take a place of a blanket, she wears a short sleeved onsie under the suit. If you are needing a better nights rest and you are like me who didn't want to go the &#34;cry it out&#34; method than do yourself and baby a favor and order this suit!",4

"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","I bought this as a replacement for the same model from about 4 years ago and I could not be more disappointed. The product quality has been sacrificed greatly probably to decrease the cost. The crotch buckle on the older model was the best part of the car seat. It was easy enough that my 4-year old could easily put it on and take it off my himself. I have another car seat from a different manufacturer and I hated the buckle on that car seat. That was main reason to go buy another Graco car seat. And, guess what, Graco replaced the buckle that was great with the one I hate on my other car seat. The new buckle is cheap, is too tight and cannot easily be handled by a 4-year old. My other complaint is with the crotch strap. The crotch strap was always too short (even after max adjustment) but on this model, it's even shorter. It is a major hassle to pull it out every time I have to strap my kid in. My suggestions for Graco meanwhile are : Fix the crotch strap and don't change something if it ain't broke! Meanwhile, I will look for a different model for my next car seat.",1
Petunia Pickle Bottom Wistful Weekender Classic Cornflower Diaper Bag with Stroller Clips,"I googled best diaper bags and Petunia pickle bottom came up top on most lists. I looked extensively at the bags on line but did not realize actual sizes till I received my bag, it's huge. My husband makes fun of me extensively but with a infant suffering from bad acid reflux and in constant need of changes, this bag is definitely getting great use. The bag is approximately the size of a medium size gym bag so if you are looking for something easy to carry and transport, this bag is not for you. But if you are like me and carry 1 blanket, 1 receiving blanket, 1 swaddle blanket, 4 changes of clothes, 5 aden and anais muslin burp clothes (they are much bigger than normal burp clothes), 10 diapers, a full size wipe packet, and still need room for items, then order this bag now. Plus the print is great and the bag is clearly well made. (small warning- the size is pretty awkward when hung on my britax stroller)",5

"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia","i bought the inglesia fast table chair after reading another manhattan mom's review... we eat out often enough as a family that we needed something for our little guy. he's not quite sitting up on his own, but this has a tight belt to fit around his waist that helps keep him upright. the chair is fully collapsible if you unbutton the side snaps. we put the chair in a canvas travel bag for our own convenience.  it very east to tighten the bar to make the chair very sturdy (you can spin the grey part ). i never give reviews - but this chair is totally worth it!!",5
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,"We have used four brands of breastmilk storage bags: Nuk, Honeysuckle, Medela, and Lansinoh. It's worth noting that we haven't had a leak with any of the bags, but we primarily use them for refrigeration. Based on other reviews, the ""true"" test of the bags seems to be freezing and subsequently thawing them. We have frozen and thawed a few of each brand with no leakage.Nuk: These are our favorites. They are slightly smaller (maybe half a centimeter?) than Honeysuckle and Lansinoh bags, but you're not supposed to put more than 6 ounces in any of them anyway. They stand up the best, which is very convenient when pouring milk into them. I do hold the bags while I pour it in, but every now and then I lose my grip and these don't fall over like the Honeysuckle and Lansinoh bags. The plastic is thicker than the Lansinoh bags. These are also available at Wal-Mart, which is convenient if you can't wait for an amazon order to be delivered. The area where you write on is clear, and it's white with the other bags. I prefer the white background, but that's because I have black countertops. Small potatoes, though. The measurement is pretty close to the Medela bottles I pump in to. These are usually about 18-20 cents a bag depending on the quantity you purchase.Honeysuckle: Our second favorite, these bags have more of a vinyl feel than a plastic feel. They're floppier than the Nuk bags, but more sturdy than the Lansinoh bags. The seal makes a clicking sound (like a Ziploc bag) when sealed, which is nice. The Nuk bags don't make that sound. My husband has had issues with the bags dripping milk out of the seal area when pouring instead of about a centimeter above the seal, where it is supposed to pour out of. The measurement seems to be off by half an ounce compared to the Medela bottles (if I pump 4.5 ounces, it will read as 4 ounces on these bags). These are about 18-20 cents a bag unless you buy a quantity of 300, in which they are 14 cents a bag (based on pricing as of July 2013). These are only available online, at least in my area (Virginia Beach).Medela: These bags could be convenient for some because you pump directly into the bags. They work just fine, but I just prefer the bottles in case I adjust while pumping the milk can't splash out. They are a stiff plastic, which means they stand up well. They only hold about 5 ounces (compared to the 6 ounces for the other bags...but I've put 9 ounces in the other bags with no issue). They are a little harder to pour out of because of the design of the bag (the milk comes out about an inch above the seal). The measurement is accurate to the Medela bottles. They are also available in retail stores (Babies R Us, some Wal-Marts). These are more expensive at about 30 cents a bag.Lansinoh: It's a shame that these bags are the most widely available, because they are the worst. They're thin, floppy, and have very little seam allowance. Based on other reviews, the bags changed in 2011. Prior to that, they were great, which is why the reviews on amazon are so high. They are about 18-20 cents a bag. They work fine in a pinch, but there are better options out there for the same (or better!) price.Hope this helps! :)",3
4 In 1 Convertible Bassinet - Porter,"I think overall this is a good buy.  I also did a lot of research before buying this bassinet.  I looked at every bassinet I could find online and then also in person to see how sturdy they were, etc.  We were very concerned with sturdiness because we had a rather rambunctious 2 3/4 yr old boy at the time of this baby's birth.  The new baby is now 6 weeks old and I am quite pleased with this bassinet overall.Even with the legs in the rocker positions, it is still quite sturdy.  It is very easy to switch back and forth from stationary to rocking as well.  Being able to rock it is really nice and my daughter loves the vibrating feature.  I like the little night light that helps me see in the middle of the night without turning on a big light.  The storage under the bassinet is great for diapers, blankets, burp rags, etc.  It is really quite roomy.I haven't used it as a co-sleeper nor a changing station yet either, just the rocking bassinet feature.  We have had to take it apart to wash it a couple of times, and while it wasn't super easy, it wasn't too bad.  I've seen worse in the past and at least it all comes off in one piece and is all machine washable. It was pretty easy for me to put the fabric back on after washing as well.My one ""con"" is the mattress pad, it is very thin.  I bought a standard bassinet mattress (about $15) to replace it and got some of the $5 Koala bassinet sheets to use with it and it has worked much better.  I use the thin pad as a portable changing pad.I think this bassinet is sturdy enough to easily last through several children, especially if you buy the better mattress.",4

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Rainforest","My baby loves this booster seat, however we've only had it a few weeks and the painted eyes on the monkey and parrot are already wearing off.  Same goes for the stickers under the slide-along salamanders.  I sure miss the days when they made things that were built to last...",3
Spectra Dew 350/Spectra 9 EXTRA LARGE Breast Shield set,Exactly as described. My wife found the stock ones a little too small. Now she only uses this one and she loves it.,5
Sealy Baby Soft Premium Mattress,"We chose this mattress because of its firmness (not too hard or too soft)and for its vinyl cover. We went with a higher priced option, but not over the top expensive. To be perfectly honest, we didn't know what else to look for in a crib mattress, I mean, how do you really test one. Well, our twins slept well together on one until they had to be separated into two cribs where they also slept very well. They are about 3 weeks shy of 3 years old and are still sleeping on the mattress in their toddler beds. We found that they fit the crib very well (no dangerous gaps), held up to changing and normal use. The mattresses both still look and feel new. By the way, the kids are both average sized. We are getting ready to buy another for our third child. I definitely recommend this mattress!",5
Infantino Vibrating Teether - Strawberry or Grape - Assort.,My daughter had this in her mouth with in one minute of the delivery man dropping it off.  She loves it.  It has a compartment for replacing the batteries so that 's a good thing.  I would say it's not waterproof so don't submerge it.,5

"MiGi Crib Mobile, Little Whales","Our son (almost 5 months) LOVES this mobile. He will watch it for as long as I have the patience to keep winding it up! The music is nice and soothing and the movement is a slow enough pace that he was able to track the whales from about 1 month of age. This mobile gets some seriously heavy use, as my son will shout and kick whenever it stops, until I wind it up again. When he was very young (1-2 months), it was one of the only things that calmed him. Now, he still loves it, but just enjoys watching the movement and doesn't need it so much for soothing.Others have mentioned durability issues, but we used this thing constantly for nearly 5 months and have had no issues. And of course, as everyone says, it is adorable!",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","We were very happy with our Dr. Brown's bottles. But we switched to Born Free after learning about the bisphenol-A scare. We used the BF bottles for 2 months with no problem but now the silicone vent is broken. The middle tip of the vent (the part that points downward) somehow has a slit in it. This makes the nipple collapse and frustrates the baby. So far, I cannot find replacement vents. We'll likely return to the Dr. Brown's bottles. These were too expensive to break after only 2 months. I would not recommend these until the replacement parts become available.",2
"Starting Small Monkey Novelty Hamper in Brown,  18 x 11 x 24",it's a little bit flimsy but it's fine for my purposes and i especially liked the price.  It's large enough to fit a bunch of (baby) clothes and I would definitely buy this again,4
"360 Degree Rotating Cover Case for Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 7 Inch Tablet with Multi-angle Stand Sheath (Galaxy Tab 3 7&quot; Inch (T210R), White)","Protects the tablet, doesn't interfere with any controls or recharging.  Only problem I've had with it is that the tablet sometimes slips out of the grooves holding the tablet upright.",4
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red","Exactly what I wanted, very supportive , looks nice,My baby loves it,She like to stay in that while I shop",5
"Columbia Bottom Line Diaper Bag, Blue","I bought this diaper bag after wearing out a similar bag made by Columbia a few years ago. I wanted something spacious, not something like a Skip Hop bag that requires you to wedge everything in tightly. For example, this bag allows me to carry everything I need AND put my camera inside instead of carrying a separate camera bag.  It is rugged and they seem to have strengthened the foil liner in the bottle compartment.Could be improved:  Each zipper has only one pull, it would be nice if they had two. Also, the zippers seem to start at the wrong end when you are wearing the bag. If you are wearing it on your right hip, you have to pull the zipper BACK to close it, which can be difficult. It would be easier the other way and adding another pull would resolve this and the fact that it can be hard to pull the zipper around the (rounded) corners.  The handles seem unnecessary to us.But overall, happy with this bag.",4
"Tadpoles Organic Flannel Fitted Crib Sheets - Set of 2, Chocolate and Natural","I wanted to order two dark sheets so the cream one is probably not going to get used by us, just passed along to the next person.  The chocolate sheet is very soft and the dark color helps promote good sleep.",4

"Ju-Ju-Be Be Rich Wallet, Perky Perennials","Love the pattern, bright color, and functionality inside.  Lots of space for credit cards, cash, and coins.  Fit nicely inside my Ju Ju Be diaper bag.  I get many compliments on it.  I would buy it again.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son is now just over a year and has had this toy for about 6 months. I bought this because he loved the baby einstein take along tunes toy and thought this would be similar type music and activity. The sound is horrible! Every instrument sound is extremely screechy. I am not sure if I just have a bad product, but I feel like I wasted my money on this.",1
S1 by Safety 1st Alpha Elite 65 Convertible Car Seat - Chelsea,"We bought this item when our daughter out grew her infant car seat. There were many options in car seats, but this one seemed to be the best priced for the options and weight limits. While installing the car seat according to the user manual (which was incredibly unclear), the latches were difficult to install to the bars in the seat and once installed we had difficulty getting the seat snug. The car seat in the rear facing position has to sit at such a high angle the front seats cannot be pushed back as far as we would liked.  It took three largely rolled towels to even get the seat to sit at the proper angle in the rear facing position. and the base of the car seat will ruin the leather of any car if the seat is not protected properly. The seat is a small recliner in the back and passengers find riding next to this seat uncomfortable. The harness straps easily twist and do not tighten with ease. And I thought I broke my fingers more than once trying to undo the harness latch! All in all I would have difficulty suggesting this car seat to anyone. We are incredibly unhappy with it and wish we would have been advised no to get this seat.",1
Fisher-Price Zen Collection Cradle Swing,Love this swing for our new born. Is easy to use very quite. Very easy to lift the cradle off and move her around. Highly recommend this product. Only draw back is I wish the mobile was electric. Small little thing.,5
Evenflo Classic CustomFlow Silicone Nipples: Medium Flow,"Our son doesn't like these nipples at all. Not sure why. Every baby is different and I would not give a 2 star review just because our baby doesn't like it. However, I don't like that there is no way to determine from the nipple, whether you have slow, medium or fast flowing nipples. Heaven forbid you have more than one speed in your home you will be reduced to counting the drips that are coming out of them.Evenflo's website is equally unhelpful.  There is no &#34;m&#34; or any other distinguishing mark that I could see, though the nipples are numbered in what appears to be some random fashion.",2
"Leachco Podster Sling-Style Infant Seat Lounger, Sage Pin Dot","Wish I had ordered this sooner!  I bought this for my grandson and he really liked it,  Unfortunately, I purchased it when he was almost two months old now at three months he is taller then average and likes to kick out of it.  It does get warm very fast and so you have to watch that a baby doesn't get too hot and uncomfortable when laying in it.  I would NEVER leave the baby unattended in it and they tell you not to let a baby sleep in them.",5
NUK Cook-n-Blend Baby Food Maker,"Hot food and plastic should never touch.  Polyurethane gases from plastics leak into the food at warm to high temperatures.  Much has been researched on the toxicity and long term effects of heated food and plastics including disruption of gene and gender-bender hormones.  I would certainly never let my child put plastics in his mouth (most all toys and teething rings are plastic, btw), and absolutely never feed him poly gases.",1
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","I had been searching for something similar to this product for several weeks now. My baby gets bored with the generic toys attached on bouncer, swing, etc. I had been looking for something that she will play with, hands on, and get her attention for more than just a couple minutes. And this does it! When she gets tired of one toy, there's plenty more to keep her busy.I actually stumbled upon this product on Amazon and after seeing the rave reviews (330+ reviews!) and being 4-5 stars, this was a must-try for my 3 month old. Only problem is, I cannot find the words to describe how WONDERFUL this toy is! Like all Moms, I have many other things to be doing with my time than sitting here writing my very first review [ever] on a product, but I want to share how great this toy is. This toy is worth every single penny!! One thing to note as I'm unsure whether it's mentioned in the product description: two of the three hanging toys (the crinkly butterfly & mirror flower) velcro on so you can remove them to attach where ever you wish!Here is a quick rundown to help you match my baby's needs/wants to yours:- My baby girl is 3 months old- She ""hates"" her car seat as she seems to get bored easily.- She LOVES playing.- She bats at toys and likes to be ""challenged"" with grabbing them.- Because she gets bored easily, I can attach this toy anywhere and everywhere since I am constantly moving her from bouncer to swing to crib to Baby Einstein Jumperoo (propped with pillows & blankets to support) and to tummy time mat to Bumbo to Johnny Jump Up (supported with blankets).",5
"Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat, Seaside Bay","My son ordered this for his daughter and we like it so well, we ordered another one for his wife to put in her car.  She is riding in style.  It's cost a little more, but it will probably last until she grow out of it.",5
Kick Mats - Deluxe Car Seat Back Protectors 2 Pack - Keep Your Car Seats 100% Clean From All The Stains And Scuffmarks Left By The Kids With These Auto-Protective Seat Covers - Designed For Most Vehicles - Protect Your Investment - Lifetime Guarantee,These mats are great.  They are large so that they cover the entire back of the seat.  The elastic bottom and belted top keep them in place.  The price is right too.  I'll be purchasing another set for my husbands car.,5
"Leachco Boomerest Angled Body Pillow, Ivory","This body pillow is nice if you are looking for something with a lot of cushion.  I couldn't sleep with it because it just had too much!  I couldn't maneuver it because it was just too filled and would always return to being fully straight.  If I tucked it under my legs the head part would come out and when I tried to have it under my head it was a real struggle to keep it between my legs!  The middle was also bigger then the rest which made it impossible for me to rest my tummy against comfortably. I was really hoping to find a body pillow for my pregnancy support but ended up just using a regular pillow. It is great when you sit with it behind you in bed, which will come in handy when I am feeding the new baby.  You can tie the two ends together which I thought would be helpful but I wont be able to use it to feed the baby because there is always a space between the two arms where you tie it.  I just got myself a boppy pillow to rest the baby against and will use this as my back support.  It is long enough that my husband and I can sit with it behind us together in bed.Don't buy if you don't have space to store it.  It is very large and very plush.  We have difficulty knowing what to do with it when not in use.  I have had it for 5 months now and it shows no signs of breaking in.This pillow is fairly soft, has a removable cover and is comfortable when used in the right way.",3
"Britax Kick Mats (2-Pack, Black)","These definitely save the back of my seats from muddy footprints. They are a little hard to get on and off and I am afraid the elastic might wear if I take them on and off too much. I really like the pockets, they hold headphones, cars, sunglasses, etc perfectly. The black matches my car seats. It is nice it comes in a two pack too!",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"Easy to install, comfortable for my son to sit on and has a very useful splash guard. The seat blends in very well with the bathroom and can be easily hung when not in use. Of all the seats out there, this one seems to be one if the most well made and most functional. Would highly recommend.",5
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","When we got it, it was too complicated and limiting (only faced forward). Also, it just didn't look comfortable for the child even though it said it was totally ergonomic. These purchases are really about personal tastes and many variables, so I really don't want to make judgments about the quality. It just wasn't right for us.",2
Dapper Snappers Add-On Clips - 4 Count,"Absolutely love these gizmos. They work perfectly, and look great with dress pants as well as jeans and khakis. These are a must-have for any growing kids' wardrobe.",5
"The Safe Sippy 2 2-in-1 Sippy to Straw Bottle, Pink","You know how it is, always looking for the right sippy that really works!?! I finally found it!!!  HURRAY FOR THE SAFE SIPPY.  And he won't drink out of anything else.  They even sent me a extra ring when mine went down the drain.  I highly recommend it!",5
"Dexbaby Safe Lift Universal Crib Wedge, White","Not sure if it is clear in the description, but this wedge has two pieces of foam and a zipper up the back.  The zipper can actually be felt at the bottom front of the wedge.  I can't really lay my son in the middle of this wedge, because the zipper from the back causes a hard bump at the bottom, front, middle of this wedge.  Also, there is not much of an incline with this wedge.  Overall, just not a great product and I wish I would not have purchased this.",2
American Red Cross Car Child View Mirror,"Well, it is a cheap mirror so don't expect it to be great.  The mounting part is great. It holds onto the rear-view mirror just fine and you don't have to worry about a suction cup coming off. The ball socket that lets you aim the mirror is a little loose, so that you need to tweak it almost every trip, but that's not a big deal.  It's real disadvantage is the mirror surface itself.  The mirror is convex so it covers a wide area (which is good), but the reflection is somewhat fuzzy.  You get just a OK view of the child.  It's hard to make out the child's expression, and I can barely see if his eyes are open or not.  For the price it's a good deal, and I haven't had any luck finding a mirror this shape and without a suction cup attachment anywhere else.",3
"UPPAbaby Vista Stroller, Cole/Slate","I love this stroller. It's tall, has a huge basket (so handy for going to the mall with a sleeping baby) and it rides well. My only problem is with folding it. It is too hard and I never manage to fold it all the way...",4
Visnow(TM) Genuine Soft Leather Coin Purse Small Change Purse with Zipper + Key Ring (Black),It's exactly what I wanted!  My only problem is that the zipper gets stuck easily.  But other than that I love it!!,4
Zippy Fun Bandana Bibs for Baby Boys and Toddlers (Stylish Blues Pack of 4),"I love these bibs. They are adorable and stylish and I've received lots of compliments on them when my son wears them. I like the double-snap closures; we've got many bibs that have a velcro closure, and my son learned to take those off when he was four months old, so they've already been donated. It would be great to see more sizes and patterns as I would surely buy them all.  What would be really cool is if Zippy made shoes to match! (hint, hint. :-)",5
"Prince Lionheart Backseat Kick Mat, Black",I just got a Volvo s60 and wanted to do all that I could to protect it. This looks great and protects like you wouldn't believe. Only downside is that my car doesn't have a lot of crevices for straps and stuff to slide into so I had to stuff the bottom straps (velcro) into the bottom of the front seat to hold them. The velcro isn't even touching. But it works great. It would probably work in many other people's cars and vans.,4
Infantino Noodle Teether - Bug,"All the other teether toys I have were a complete bust.  The noodle teether however, was a huge hit.  The little legs were perfectly shaped for him to gnaw on & it's a cute toy to boot",5
Primary Colors Cradle Bedding - Color Yellow - Size 15X33,The description says that it is 15X33.  This is not true.  When I measured it was 11X24.  The picture and description doesn't say anything about the underneath being white instead of red.  The fitted sheet was so poorly sewn that the first time washing it I'm sure it would have fallen apart.  The fabric was see through.  The return process was horrible and I was out restocking fees and shipping costs.  Had it been properly represented I would not have ordered it.,1
Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey,"These are great in the stroller or car bc you can slip them under a harness and much easier for baby to hold, since we don't attach our pacifiers.  I just wash it off and try to keep the toy part dry, or use a toy wipe.",5
"UPPAbaby MESA Infant Car Seat, Drew Orange","We pre-ordered the Mesa in January, my son was due in May but the company we ordered from assured us the seat would be released by then. UppaBaby didn't keep up their end of the deal and the release date kept being pushed back so we canceled and got a Peg Perego SIP 30/30 instead. I was ecstatic when I heard the Mesa was finally been released - we absolutely love our UppaBaby Vista so I was excited to try another product. We were in an accident and needed a new carseat so the first thing my husband and I did was go to see the Mesa...huge let down.Pros:It looks cool design wiseThe latching system is pretty neatCons:1.) Terrible Construction - for as much as it costs the seat looks like its made out of very cheap plastic. The one I saw in the store that they had JUST gotten was already scratched and the handle looked like it was separating. I'm used to the sturdy well constructed handle of the Peg Perego that we'd used heavily for several months - this one looked like it might fall apart any second.The sunshade is a nightmare. My son is very sensitive to outdoor light, especially when he's sleeping so this was a must for us. The UppaBaby fails big here. The shade will not stay nice and tight over his face like the pictures. It popped completely out of the back and kind of sags over the front so the baby is exposed front and back. It never stayed connected to the back - which made the back look like a cheap plastic bucket. On top of that the plastic rods that are used to construct the sunshade popped out of the fabric on the ends and was poking out  - I could totally see a kid turning their head and poking their eye on this.It also felt heavier than our current car seat.2.) Base - most people rave about this but I can't figure out why. Our Peg Perego has a super tight fit to the base on 4 points. The Mesa seat seemed like it just clicked on to the front of the base so my husband was able to wiggle it around and even pull it up some. At first he wasn't as against the seat as I was but as soon as he saw this he was convinced this was not the seat. After being in an accident and seeing what really happens having a seat that fits right on the base is so important.3.) Doesn't fit on the Vista - apparently it fits on the cheaper Cruz but not the 2013 Vista without adapters....this is annoying. Plus even with the adapters the carseat doesn't fit tight on the stroller.Overall: For the price this carseat is a totally disappointment and I am a fan of the company and their other products. I give them some leeway because the Mesa is their first carseat so hopefully they take note of the issues and resolve them. I wouldn't spend my money on this - the Peg Perego is an awesome seat, doesn't look as streamlined but is so safe, excellent quality and easy to use.I'm either going to get another Peg Perego or a Nuna  Pipa - definitely not the Mesa.",2
"Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep","We purchased this for our daughter as an infant and she has always loved the sheep and the sounds have often helped her get to sleep.  Now that she is older we've removed the sound unit, but she still likes to cuddle with the sheep.  It's a great gift, and we've sent it for other newborns and each parent has told us how adorable and helpful it has been.",4
"Content&amp;Calm Cot Canopy Breeze Crib Shade, Darkness and Insect Protection, Black/Green",This product was exactly what I needed to help my daughter sleep in daycare.  Unfortunately per the Washington State Department of Early Learning it is banned from use in Washington daycare centers.  They believe it does not provide adequate visibility.  I disagree but they won't let us use it for our daughter.,4
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green",Very durably but a bit of a pain to use since it's not a sponge.,4
Anti Monkey Butt Powder,"I was expecting it to have a nice scent like the one for babies.  It does not.  I intended to use the product as a body powder to soak up excess perspiration but due to the funny odor, it's not well suited for that.  The odor seems to smell like dirt, earthy and damp.  Given that the product states that it can be used in areas other than your butt, you would expect it to smell nice.",3

The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"I absolutely loved this little sleeper.  With our newborn, it made it possible to have her sleep in our bed without worrying about rolling over on her.  Also, we could use it when we needed her to sleep in the living room.  Friends bought another brand that was open at the feet and they woke up to find their little one had wiggled out of the box.  They found him under the covers.  We used ours until about 2 months.  At that point, her sleeping pattern seemed to changed and we weren't putting her to bed in the same way.  So, she stopped using it before she outgrew it (and she was 95% percentile in length).  Also, by that time I was more comfortable having her sleep in ghte bed without some extra protection.  With swaddling, cluster feeding during the day and having her sleep in our bed with this sleeper, she was sleeping a good 6-8 hours starting with Day 3.  All in all I really loved it and will certainly use it if we are fortunate enough to have another child.",5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,This pillow is a lifesaver! I ordered it for my wife after having it recommended to us by one of my clients and it is AWESOME! She sleeps better and feels more supported and it made our recent road trip a breeze because she was able to curl up with it and sleep for a lot of the driving that we did. This is a great product and if you're trying to find something you can do to help your pregnant wife/partner...get this pillow and surprise her with it! :),5
Hevea Panda Teether,This was used a lot for the first 8 teeth up front... would drop it in the freezer for a bit too to offer a little more comfort (however doesn't stay cold long) but she really liked this and we liked that it wasn't synthetic. Held up very well to vigorous chewing. Rinses off/cleans easily.,4
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,We wanted to use this as a crib for our baby's first months when he was sleeping in our room. We also wanted to use it for travel. Unfortunately the mattress is really flimsy and doesn't lay flat. Also the bassinet doesn't have adequate support frame so it really sags in the middle. I try to lay my baby in it longways and he ends up perpendicular as he gradually slides down into the divot. It seems like there is a propensity for the baby to roll over because of this sag/slant. We put a giant piece of cardboard under the mattress as a support and this helps some but it still sags in the middle gradually as the cardboard starts to give.My mom also bought a Graco pack n play for when we are visiting and it has a simliar issue even though it is a more expensive model. Apparently Graco doesn't make them like they used to. My mother in law has an old Graco pack n play and it has an awesome bassinet that doesn't sag at all.We are looking to buy a new pack n play as the sag is so bothersome to us.,2

"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane","Bought this seat for our kid who's outgrowing her first car seat. It was easy to install and looks good. We chose it because it can take our kid all the way until she doesn't need a child seat anymore.  It converts from rear to forward facing.Nice features - two cup holders, well padded.Unexpected feature - the seat is BIG.  Even though it has no base, when it's rearward facing it takes up a LOT of room. In a 4 door VW Golf that means that the front seat is upright and shifted forward. Luckily my SO is 5'5&#34;, but even still it's not terribly comfortable in the front seat anymore.  Shouldn't be a problem once we turn the seat around in another year.",4
"Carter's Diaper Stacker, Sunny Safari",I am very happy with the diaper stacker - it is bigger than expected which is nice - it actually fits all my cloth diapers in it which I was not expecting.  It is nice quality and soft and lovely and I am looking forward to using it.,5

The one piece design is good in theory, but is quite cumbersome to use with a hands free bra.  You must fit the entire connecter end through the bra hole and then screw the bottles on while you're wearing it.  It is MUCH easier to use the typical two piece design when using a hands free bra.  Had I realized this, I would not have made this purchase.",3

Kidsme Food Feeder Essential Set,"Our baby has only been on solids for a few weeks and this is by far his favorite way to eat. It combines his two favorite things, chewing on stuff and bananas. Don't be fooled, it is only slightly less messy than spoon feeding baby. He whatever is inside in his hair, face, arms, etc. And when hes done eating he bangs it around spreading food all over his highchair. But he'll eat foods from this that he won't eat from a spoon, and he loves it if we put a tiny piece of ice inside for him to suck on. He learned to use it immediately and he gets excited when he sees us filling it.",5

"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","PAY ATTENTION TO THE SIZE!!!! these were too big for my car but I bought the smaller ones and I love them. The only down side is that they can be pulled off by the toddler, and they don't stick well if you try to initially stick them on when it's cold out. The cling worked great when I put them on in 70ish degree weather and stayed on through the winter (on the side of the car with my infant), however on the side with my toddler, she would pull it off and now I have to wait until its warm again to re-stick it.

Boppy Prenatal Sleep Wedge,"I used this during my pregnany when sleeping and lounging on the couch. I liked the size of it, because it isn't huge like some preganacy pillows and it really allowed me to 'wedge' it into whatever space I needed to keep the weight of my belly supported.",5
"Stork Craft Tuscany Glider and Ottoman, Cherry/Beige","Love the chair, however the cushions on the arms are not very thick and the sponge stuff slides down so there is no padding between the wood and microfiber material.

"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","The monitor is great.  We use it everyday, and when we travel without it, we wish we hadn't.The first issue is that the battery doesn't last very long.  It's not that big of a deal, but it's mildly inconvenient to be moving the cord around all the time, except . . .The second issue is that since the cord is being moved all the time it has now frayed near the wall plug and has required a repair.  I doubt it will last much longer.  It seems a product at this price-point should come with a decent cord.A better battery or a better cord would have made this a 5 star product hands down.  I'm not sure why they just don't use a usb charger, those are cheap and easily replaceable.",4
"Britax Frontier 85 SICT Booster Seat, Cardinal","This is a very stylish and comfortable booster seat, hopefully this will be the last one I buy.  Not Cheap but I would say worth the money for the peace of mind and protection it provides.",5
Summer Infant Best View Digital Color Video Monitor,"I have had this product, or its predecessor since 2011.  I really like the product, and think it is amazing to be able to watch the baby instead of just listen.However, this particular model broke in less than 1 year into its life. Summer was amazing, and replaced it for me quickly.  However, it broke down again in less than a year.  Unfortunately, it was no longer covered at that point.  Summer offered me a reduced price on buying another brand new one.I should also mention that the break downs were on the hand held unit, but I did also have a camera break on me (which Summer also replaced).I would suggest trying another brand or model, because it doesn't seem that this one was made to last.",3

"Zoli Gummy Sticks Baby Gum Massagers, Green/Orange","These guys are made well. The chewy tip springs back without separating when bitten hard and are part of the stick and not just plugged on; nothing to separate and easy to clean. Caution with the handle. Curiosity still killed the cat and sometimes the handle is chewed on. In my opinion the handle should be shorter to accommodate exploring the stick's other end. It's not as much of an issue with 4-8 months olds, however, when they start crawling or are walking, there could be a problem. With close supervision, or in situations where the baby is sitting such as in a car seat, high chair, or just being carried,  this stick does get back there to the molars and makes a good alternative chewing device.",3
"Kissaluvs Cotton Fleece Hybrid One Size Contour Diaper, Unbleached","I started off wanting to exclusively use one type of cloth diaper (gDiapers) but quickly found out that, since babies come in all different shapes and sizes, not all cloth diaper solutions work for every baby in every situation.These diapers say they are for babies from about 7lbs to 35lbs and I would say that is probably perfect although we are only about 13lbs so I can't speak to the top end.  As far as the small end, I actually prefer this diaper for the smaller babes because you dont have to mess with snaps and you can adjust the rise to exactly what you need by folding the front down.  I would think that by the time you got up into 30 lbs however, it would pretty much be a shell to hold soakers as there is no way this would be enough absorbency for a toddler.There is a attached long soaker that can be folded in half for smaller babes.  this is enough wetness for average wetters and overnight for small babes.  I currently am using this on 12lb 3 month old twins for overnight use and it works but if left on much over 8 hours we start gambling with leaks.I started using these with my twin girls when I was looking for an overnight solution that would allow me to go 4 hours between diaper changes without leaks. They were about 7-8 lbs at this time and very tall and skinny. This snugged right up without leaving any marks and we haven't had any leaks unless it was left on too long.I was not sure how I felt about the no faster situation but I actually like it.  I use a Snappi fastener with it an I can make very precise adjustments because I am not limited by snaps or velcro.  This actually would allow for the diaper to be used on a slightly smaller baby if needed but there is some bulk once the front is folded down.We have used these with Econobum covers, Rumparooz and Thirsties size 1 covers as well as wool and they make a great system.For those having problems with absorbency, the problem is likely in cloth diapering basics: you must prep (wash) the diaper and insert about 6 times before use. Wash with twice the water and half the detergent and pre and post rinse. As your baby gets into the 15+ lbs arena, however, especially if they are heavy wetters, you may want to add a doubler especially for overnight.  And remember this is a FITTED diaper and MUST be used with a COVER (plastic or wool) at all times!Bottom Line: Decent diaper that will fit through a variety of sizes, often will work as an overnight solutionPros: Decent absorbency as-is especially in the smaller sizes, almost unlimited size adjustment, will definitely fit from birth to PTCons: Will need doublers for absorbency as your babe hits the midway mark",4

"OsoCozy Chinese Prefold Diapers, Infant 4x6x4","These diapers are great quality, absorbent and functional, but very big! If I turn down the front to fit my newborn baby it makes it so super bulky on him that he can't fit his clothes, even if I go a size bigger. I have to turn down a good 4-5 inches at least. I wish the seller would specify that they are premium size. I'm going to end up trimming them to fit.",4
"South Shore Angel 4 Drawer Chest, Espresso",This item is garbage.

ZoLi BOT XL Straw Sippy Cup (Green) - 9 oz.,"we dropped the bottle cold turkey and switched to this straw cup at one year old. luckily, because this straw cup is so awesome, the change was easy and may daughter never cared that her bottle went missing. she transitioned to milk in this straw cup instead of a bottle. its not truly spillproof, if they drop it, which happens often, so milk can leak out a little, but nothing a napkin cant clean up. the benefits of having the pressure in the straw, so when they suck there is resistance, is a great feature and i think this is why it was so easy to transition froma  bottle, because it has a similar feel. also the silicon straw is really soft, and the weighted bottom makes sure every last sip of milk goes down. its pretty easy to clean to, just rinse out, and i found to clean the straw out you just have to hold the one end under the sink while squeezing on the straw (mouth) end, it sucks up the water and shoots it out (kind of looks like milking a cow) anyway - i went from buying three 6ozs' to now two of the 9 oz's and i can still use more. I have a whole cabinet full of all the other sippy cups that you find in grocery stores and baby stores, but the zoli bot is the best and ive only been able to find it here",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red","The BabyBjorn is one of the best if not the best of the baby carriers. Head support for the baby and weight distribution for you. Comfortable to wear for long outings, it's reversible when the baby is older. Having had to carry around seven children, I know from a Dad's experience. It's very well made and lasted for years. Gave it away to a relative and bought a newer one which is even better. You also cannot beat the price on Amazon. All the baby stores and some of the discount stores charge thirty to fifty percent more for the exact same product.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Healthy Care High Chair,"This is the best high chair. It is easy to assemble, easy to keep clean, and very safe. No chance for it to tip over. It is also the only high chair that I know of that comes with the extra toys that this one comes with. I had this for my son 5 years ago and I liked it so much I bought another one for my newest baby. Excellent purchase!",5
"Munchkin Stroller Links, Black","Ok, but not  as I expected.I had these type of strollers for my twins 35yrs ago.mine were sturdier,hard plastic/rubber and they were screwed on.these are flimsy,and when the strollers are folded,they are all over the place.The old ones laid flat and held them rigid and flat for storing.

Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"My son is one of those high maintenece babies.  We spend a lot of time entertaining him!  He loves his jumperoo.  (He's four months) He'll start to cry and fuss, so I stick him in there and yeah - he quiets down and starts to jump!  He'll stay in there for ten minutes at a time, but for a child who gets bored very easily, it's a lifetime for mommy and daddy!",5
Sassy Wonder Wheel,"I searched for this after I saw my friend had it. It's perfect for the diaper bag since it suctions to tables. It makes noise, but isn't too loud for restaurants with the balls that roll around.",5
"Bumbleride Flyer Reversible Handle Stroller with 7&quot; Wheels, Ruby","I originally bought Chicco travel system.  I hated how bulky and heavy it was.  I wish that I would have gotten the bumbleride flyer right away.Bumbleride Flyer has convertible handles and switching literally takes 3 seconds.  You can switch it from front to back and vice versa anywhere, even when the baby is in the stroller.  MyChicco Keyfit 30 car seat fits in this stroller.  The stroller fully reclines.  The foot rest can be raised.  The basket is large and fits my large diaper bag and other stuff.  The canopy is really huge.  The handles are adjustable, so pushing is comfortable for my husband, who is tall, and me. In addition, we were able to take this stoller on a plane with us (well, check it at the gate), rather than check it in with the luggage, since it is not huge.  The stoller comes with the cupholder, the rain shield, and the part that should be used when you put a car seat in it.  These things don't come with other strollers in this price range.  It folds and unfolds pretty easily.Now a few cons to this stoller....Since I got the lava black color (my husband pushed for this color, I wanted the red one :)), is that it gets dirty pretty quickly.  You can see all the stains.  However, I just take the seat off and throw it in the washer (I could not do this with my old stroller).  I don't dry it in the dryer, but it dries over night.  The stoller does not ride best on gravel or sand. Another thing is that folding and unfolding is not as easy as on the City Mini, however everything else compensates for this.I highly recommend this stroller. It is the best alternative to other $600-$900 stollers.  You really get a lot for your money here.",5

"Harmony Olympian Youth Booster Car Seat, Black Tech","We needed car seats for twins and this was our third one we have gone thru. First there was newborn (they grew out of those), then toddler (they grew out of those) and then we could these.

The twins are now 7 and still need a booster and they can still sit comfortably in these.",4

Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Moonbeam Dreams Soother,I ordered this product for my 5 month old daughter for Christmas and she LOVES it.  The soother is just the right amount of light that changes and lights up in different sequences.  The little bear gentle swings back and forth and is very effective in getting her to sleep pretty quickly. The sound also has two volume levels which is good because I like the music to be very soft.  The only potential problem is the strap that attatchs the soother to the crib is not very long so beware if you have a crib with very thick railings.,4

Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"My daughter is almost 3 months old, and is a little young for most of the toys we have.  However, this toy is a huge hit with her!

Gummee Glove Teething Mitten Blue,"Great idea for infants! Infants love to explore with their hands and mouth, therefore having a secured toy on their hand, assures no germs and no constantly picking up a toy. The teething ring itself is PBA free, making it healthy. The crinkle patch is nice, thinking it would be nice on both side. It's machine washable and comes with a bag, which also helps out to keep it clean and germ free. It can be a little hard to put on the hand.",3
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I found these bottles to be very frustrating.  If the cap wasn't put on just right the bottle would leak horribly.&#60;br /&#62;Even if I did get the cap on without leakage, all my 5 month old had to do was bump the cap causing it to move a fraction of an inch and formula would be dribbling all over him.  Then I would have to stop feeding, take off the cap, put on the nipple cover and put back on the bottle in order to get it closed just right again.  The only reason I tried them was because I needed a wide mouth bottle with a medium flow nipple.  These are definately not worth the money. If I could, I would rate them a negative 10.  I find Playtex Disposable bottles to be the best......if only they had a medium flow nipple.",1
"Fisher-Price Musical Mobile, Rainforest Peek-a-Boo Leaves","This is a cute mobile and seems worth the price. As others have mentioned, the music is a bit quiet but it's a nice volume for going to sleep and I think it sounds a bit louder for the baby, who is closer to it. Our daughter enjoys it and she was 4 months old when we bought it. This is the second mobile we've purchased and we chose this one because our other one needs to be hand-wound and only plays for a couple of minutes. I like that this one plays longer so keeps her entertained longer. Our baby also likes to watch the light that this shines when she's going to sleep.",4
"Britax Pavilion 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Biscotti",I love everything about this carseat. We had to switch our 8 month old to a convertible because she was too long for the Britax B-safe (also highly recommend). This carseat leaves me without a doubt in my mind that she is safe. It has reinforced steel bars on both sides of her body and it is cushiony in the seat for her comfort and safety. It is hard enough to buckle and unbuckle that I never have to worry about her unbuckling herself. The straps are easy to adjust. The BEST part about this carseat for us is that it fits in our 2008 Honda Civic sedan with the seat pushed all the way back with about an inch to spare between the seat and the carseat. I love Britax products!,5
Boon Squirt Baby Food Dispensing Spoon in Pink,"pros:  i can use my free hand to do other stuff (e.g. wipe my baby's mouth or hold his hands so he's not sucking on them), easy to clean - just twist the bottom off and any standard bottle brush should fit inside, no bowl needed, no mess, wonderful for store bought baby food (e.g. gerber)cons:  can't use anything lumpy (e.g. oatmeal or rice cereal), a little pricey, i like the overall spoon shape better onDr. Brown's Long Spatula Spoonbecause it's easier to wipe my baby's mouth with",5
Bright Starts Bouncing Buddies Cradling Bouncer in Blue,"I bought this bouncy seat for my babysitter.  The one we have at home was twice as expensive and our daughter (3 months) seems to like them equally.  The quality is just fine -- nothing special, but it does what it is supposed to do, and you can't beat the $25 price tag!  My biggest complaint is the the toy bar comes off very easily.  With the Fisher Price seat that I have at home, I can pick it up to move it by the toy bar (without the baby in it).  I can't do that with this seat -- the bar pops right off.",4
"Munchkin Twisty Teether Ball, Colors May Vary",this is a really good teether toy.  we bought one but got tired of moving it from the car to the house along with the baby.  so i bought another one to leave in the car.  this is the best teether toy i've found so far and he loves it.,5

I had my husband order it through his account for our daughter and since he is overseas, I asked him If this box was sent all the way from there, since it came in such a bad shape. He blames me for being such an Amazon Fanatic! Now he is working on getting it returned, and trying to see if they can send us a new one. Hopefully it comes in good condition.",2

"Nuvo Ritmo Pregnancy Sound System, Black","The Ritmo works great.  I wasn't sure if I would hear it myself and I realized that I just need to play it at one of the lowest levels on my Ipod so I can't hear it but sound still comes out.  I assume the baby doesn't want to blow it's ear drums yet.  My husband connected 2 cords and I charged the tiny (ipod shuffle size) machine for 14 hours and I was ready to go.  It has an extender for when I get really big.We bought this primarily to get the baby used to sounds that we could control.  We heard from multiple new parents that the only thing to calm their infants were sounds they were used to hearing, examples: shower, car motor, hair dryer, etc.  We are thinking that if we could get the baby used to some classical music and lullaby renditions of the beatles that we could then just play the same playlist and be able to calm our future baby.  This may be wishful thinking but for this price it's worth the risk to get a few more hours of sleep later on.",5

Kleenex Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Moist Wipes - 346 ct,"These items are neat little towelettes that normally come in a handy little plastic container, and this is the family-sized package that includes the tub, six refills, and 10 purse-sized travel packs. They are very handy, and work wonders for insuring cleanliness. Personally, I now consider them a necessary part of my toiletries!On the down side, flushing these things *can* result in plumbing problems, as I experienced. Apparently, if your sewer line is relatively new and clear, they should give you no problems. But, if your system has any place in it where things can collect, you will face problems. According to the plumber, toilet paper begins to break down quite quickly, but these towelettes can take over a month to do so.So, overall, I do like this product, and I recommend it. I just recommend that if you live in an older house, that you do not flush them.",4
"Juno Blu Phoenix Breast Pump Case, Celadon","This fits my Medela Pump In Style pump perfectly.

The bag is expensive enough it should have the Velcro.  I just got his tiny case though and for the money I am very happy.",5

Cosmos &reg; Milky White Table Edge Soft Guard with 4 Corners with Cosmos Fastening Strap,"Exactly what I needed.I had bought a desk on the cheaper side to study. The edges were very sharp and painful so I couldn't rest my arms on them, and God forbid my knee happens to hit the side of the lower drawer.This product really does the job. The application was very quick and simple, the adhesive is holding pretty well. It is no longer remotely painful and the area is very well cushioned. The angles are very useful not only for the angles of the desk but I even applied one to the angel of the lower drawer and it is no longer a problem if my knee hits it.The color is off white and matches my beige table perfectly.Great product. Thank you.",5

"Trend Lab Fleece CribWrap Rail Covers for Crib Sides (Set of 2), Natural, Wide","I'm certain most parents have experienced their 6-12 month old or older teething on the crib and leaving teeth marks.So like any parent, I wanted to prevent my kid from biting the crib altogether.With that said, this product works, but fitting it on larger cribs will be somewhat of a problem. (minor) In my opinion, it's a better alternative to the velcro snapping brands or the ""rubber"" versions. And after about a month of use, my daughter hasn't tried biting the crib anymore. What she did do was lightly teethe on the guards rather than gnaw at them.They're in excellent condition and I actually purchased two of them. I've had them for a total of about 4 or 5 months now and they've held up nicely.For what you're paying, I'd call it a good deal.",4

"Dream On Me Classic Toddler Bed, Cherry","Honestly it was easy to put together although I wish there were holes for the middle legs (they do come with the screws to make the holes but would have been nice to have). It's very sturdy and at a great price.  The only thing is that my little one is a bad sleeper, meaning he sleeps side ways and moves around a lot.  So he was falling off the bed at times lol. I will just have to figure out a good spot for the bed so he doesn't fall off. It's close to the ground but the bad sleeping makes him wake up when he feels like he is falling off.Very excellent bed. I would recommend it to others.",5

Infant Bucket Seat Liner Color: Pink,I was so worried about my baby over heating in his car seat. I didn't even think that the plush car seat material would leave him burning up and sweaty but it did. He cried and cried while in the car and it wasnt even in the heat of the summer. I looked everywhere for a solution. I finally found this. It's October in Texas and not that hot but it does seem t keep the baby much cooler.,4
"Lansinoh Soothies Gel Pads, 2 Count","Being new to breastfeeding and having a baby with a small tongue tie as well as latch issues has made for some VERY sore nipples. Thankfully the nurses at the hospital gave me a box of Soothies before I left - putting them on gives me instant relief and makes it possible for me to actually wear a bra or a shirt without being in pain. They are very easy to clean and reuse, plus they can be refrigerated which makes them even more soothing.The only things I don't like are that you have to clean off the residue before you can breastfeed and that they sometimes cling to the nipples when you're trying to take them off, which can be quite painful. But those are minor issues, and I still highly recommend this product.",5
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink","Granddaughter loves sitting in her own chair to watch TV at PopPop's house.  I took the rockers off, so she actually has to sit still.  Good quality, it's been in use for a good awhile now and I anticipate it being used for a long time to come.",5

"Stork Craft Aspen Combo Dresser Chest, Natural","I may be overly positive about this because my brother and sister put this together for me.  I had read all the reviews about how hard it was to assemble, and so I had warned them.  It sounded frustrating, for sure... the pictures weren't all correct and it took a long time, but they did not have to drill any additional holes or anything.  We were missing on piece to screw in one of the drawer knobs, so we did have to go to the hardware store for that.  One other minor complaint... be prepared for the changing pad to take up alot of the space on top... I thought I would have more room for other things.All that said, I really like this piece of furniture.  It's beautiful.  The day after it was put together, the dog jumped up against it and scratched it, but it's nearly impossible to see, which is a good thing for furniture in a child's room.  It feels very sturdy and the drawers are a good size.",5
"The First Years True Fit Convertible Car Seat, Monet","The only reason I did not give this car seat 5 stars is because it is not set up the best for rear facing. When you have it in the rear facing position, it makes it nearly impossible to reach the strap and leaver to tighten or loosen the straps.  The positioning of the strap and leaver are made for accessing it in the forward facing position.  We had to rig up an extra long string and run the strap underneath the car seat to be able to tighten the straps - and even by doing this, it made it really difficult to easily tighten or loosen the straps.  Besides this minor annoyance, everything else about this car seat is fantastic. Our son is 9 months old and 19 pounds, so it will only be a few more months until we can turn it around and not have to deal with the strap issue. I love the safety rating this car seat has, and it is very cozy and cushy for our little on. Nice fabric and color, very good quality. Very easy to snap into place. We used a rolled up towel to stick under the foot end to tilt the seat back a bit so that our son's head did not flop forward or to the side when he falls asleep.  Again, I think this will be aleviated once we turn it forward facing. Good quality for the money. I would definitely recommend it to others.",4
Dreambaby Soft Potty Seat - Blue,Got this as a spare to use in our second bathroom but it's got a big bump right in the front - maybe meant to block pee? - so my 2.5 year old daughter isn't quite tall enough to sit herself on the potty by herself. Kinda bummed.,3
Haba Ladybug Pacifier Chain,"I love Haba products & this pacifier holder is another winner from Haba.  It is beautifully crafted and the colors are vibrant. The clasp is strong & the length of the chain is just right - not too long to be tangly & not too short to limit its functionality.  I deducted one star because I was hoping to use it with all the various pacifiers I have, however it does not work with pacifiers without a &#34;handle&#34; in the front. I ended up buying one of the Heimess brand pacifiers; which works even with pacifiers without the &#34;handle&#34; in the front.",4
"The First Years True Choice P400 Premium Digital Monitor, 2 Parent Unit","[APRIL 18, 2011--If you did not find this review helpful, I would sincerely appreciate your leaving a comment letting me know why. I spent an hour of my time working with this product and would appreciate a moment of yours! Thank you.]My ""baby cycle"" stretched from 1988 through 1992, but my consumer electronics experience spans a much greater range of years. For my children, it was a great innovation to have a monitor in the nursery, with a portable receiver powered by AA batteries. That receiver was on my belt many an afternoon and many an evening when my kids were infants.""The First Years,"" a fairly respected brand, offers their ""P400"" set to get both caregivers in on the monitoring action.. This unit is packaged to show well in a discount department store's nursery department, where it will be enticing to those looking for modern (hey! it's digital) shower gifts. A wedge-shaped cardboard package encloses a sandwich of form-fitting PET plastic, which recycles as No. 1 along with soda bottles and milk containers. It may not be Amazon-style minimal packaging, but it works for point of sale without being difficult to open.Once you open it, you'll find the abomination of world electronics: three plastic units (one labeled ""child,"" which is the main transmitter), and two labeled ""parent."" Along with that, you'll discover two battery packs with pigtail connectors (the same kind used in cell phones and game controllers), and no less than THREE identical white ""wall wort"" transformer power units, each with spindly wire leading to an adapter plug. For parents settling a nursery, this is a lovely introduction to the world of child electronics--a world which never offers enough wall outlets for all the bulbous, outsize transformer blocks seeking a home.I would love to offer some good ""stars"" for this product, but I cannot for two reasons:1. The ""child"" unit was dead on arrival. I'll note that you can use a screwdriver (as you'll have to for the other two units) to reveal a space for three AAA batteries that can be used as a temporary, power failure backup. But, the manufacturer admits that the transmitter will eat those batteries pretty quickly, and discourages you from using them as the prime source. There's also a mounting hole that will accept a #8 pan head screw at least 3/4-inch long, as long as you happen to have one of those lying around.2. In what I can only call a design failure, the ""parent"" units have a jack for the recharging plug. But that recharging plug also fits perfectly into a second jack meant for a headphone plug. That seems to violate any sense of good consumer product design. The manufacturer acknowledges the mistake by slipping in an errata sheet warning against using the wrong jack, but I sure missed it when I was testing these.The design seems to borrow from cordless digital telephones that communicate with each other--allowing any of the units to communicate with each other, or one with the other two. But sadly, I have to leave it to other reviewers to say whether this technology works. Personally, I think that pressing an intercom button to ""soothe a child"" (as it says in the instructions) sounds like it could encourage negligent behavior or actually wake the child all the way. But as I said at the top, I'm old-school about stuff like that.I do not recommend this product, as I think it was poorly designed and would leave parents with a tangle of cords and gadgets to organize.",1
Carter's I Love My Mom Baby Boy's Bear Blankie,"Perfect, was a little pricey, but Grandson had lost a blankie while on vacation, and this one was exactly like it.",5
Wubbanub Infant Pacifier ~ Black Kitten,My grandaughter was born premature and the hospital gave her this type of pacifier.  I ordered the kitten as an extra.  It's adorable and she loves it.  Great gift to give at a baby shower.,5
Podee Double Pack Feeding System,"These bottles are quite convenient for my baby when he is toddling around the house and just wants to have a sip every once in a while. He doesn't have to strain his neck tipping back for a normal bottle. He took to it quickly and I get tons of comments from people on how great of an idea it is.  A few of my other mommy friends have invested in these as well.My only beef is that it leaks, a lot. If the nipple is at all upside down, say when the baby falls asleep in his car seat, I am left with a messy cleanup. I have tried different nipples by another brand and they seem to keep the leakage down a tiny bit, but not much. Hopefully this is a design flaw they can fix in the future. But soon I won't be needing them anymore :)",4
"Pampers Swaddlers, Size 2, Economy Plus Pack, 184 ct","I love these diapers.  They are absorpent, comfortable, quiet and soft.  Tell Pampers to make this same type in bigger sizes.  Even a one year old would prefer a SOFT diaper!:)",5
Flower &amp; Bee Wallables,I bought these for my nursery before my daughter was born. In her room I did a bugs/butterfly theme. It came out so adorable that I still get compliments on it.,5
"Skip Hop Zoo Safety Harness, Monkey",Very cool............,5
"Sassy On The Go Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary",I love this dispenser.  At first I was a little leery because it looked like the formula didn't stay put in its section but as long as you have the opening over the biggest part it is fine.  I see another user said it is hard to get out and it spills.  I just rest it on top of the bottle opening and jiggle it side to side and it works fine for me.  I have the other brand dispenser (forget the name) and that one does not keep the formula in its compartments at all.I have been really happy with this dispenser and I have been using it for 8 months. I'm so glad this is on the market wish I had had one with my other children.,5
Hello Kitty Baby Pacifier Leash Holder Strap with Cover (No Metal Clips for Safety),"Should have wrote this along time ago, but im just now getting around to it. This product is very cute, and it protects the pacifier. The only down fall is that it ripped very easy only after a few weeks, I just ended up going back to the normal pacifier holders.",2
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"I had recieved this swing for a gift off my registry list, and what a choice it was.  I am completely happy with the swing.  My son was born in April and weighed 7 lbs 7 oz.  He was very small, but we began using the swing right away.  It is the only way he would sleep when he was not laying with me.  As he has grown the swing is still his number one choice to sleep in. He is now much bigger, about 16 lbs and 26 inches long.  His feet are begining to dangle over the end.  He still loves to look at himself in the mirror and watch the birds go around his head.  He enjoys the toys that are attached and I have made some modifications to them by adding link-a-dos with toys so that he has a variety to choose from.  He mostly likes the laying down position.  I have recommended the swing to many people looking in the store.  I swear by the swing.  If them made if for adults I would buy one for myself.  I think this swing, in comparisions to the ones my friends have, is way better than any other on the market.",5
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"I bought this toy for my 4 month old on the recommendation of a friend who's child also had one and loved it. When I came back today to write my review, I noticed that it is ""not recommended for children under 3"" because of a choking hazard? I don't see it as a choking hazard (only if it were broken, I suppose), and probably not a toy a 3+ year old would be interested in.The sound quality is good and the lights are fun, but the run time is pretty short. My 4 month old would rather chew on it, and isn't quite able to press the button herself when the song is over. it's nice and lightweight to take along with us but I wouldn't say it's as great as other reviewers. Maybe as she gets older we'll get more use out of it.",3

"Flensted Mobiles Nursery Mobiles, The 4 Viking ships","My grandson was referred to as the ""little viking"" when he was in utero.  Now that he is one, this mobile will hang in his play room.  Very cute and unique!  I'm pleased with the purchase.",4
"American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Chenille Porta-Crib Sheet, Celery","Super soft sheet!!!! Although it says &#34;chenille&#34; it is actually stretchy velour/velvet. Not chenille, which is rough. I like it much better than the regular crib sheets, its a lot cozier. Also, this is for a mini-crib or a pack-n-play, not a regular sized crib.",4
Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer MODEL# TAT-2000C,I had higher hopes for this product.  It is a bit cumbersome on a small forehead/temporal area to use and it is not that accurate.  I usually do it 3 times and take an average.  I also do it on myself to be sure it is measuring correctly.  If you can use a good old oral or rectal themometer they are much more accurate.,3
"OXO Tot Tub Kneeling Mat, Blue",This mat is great. My knees are comfy and it folds and hangs on a storage hook or the door knob. Perfect!,5
North States Superyard 3 in 1 Wood Gate,"I love the metal version of this- it's extremely sturdy and does a excellent job keeping my crawling, standing 9-month old secure even when not attached to the wall or configured as a play yard.  However, this version wood is much lighter and can't be used in this manner- it would be extremely easy for him to move it.",2
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper,  Rainforest Friends","every single one of my friends with babies recommended some version of the rock n' play.  we used it the day our son got home for the hospital, and he just loves it.  this version has the vibration option and i am SO happy i made sure to get that, he calms down immediately as soon as we turn that on.  Also, the pattern is really cute.  i would recommend this to anyone!",5

"Thermos Dual Compartment Lunch Kit, Dora The Explorer","Awesome product! Durable. I love the two compartments and the plastic container that comes in the bottom. This has worked out great for my 3 year old. It holds a sandwich, banana, two drink boxes, an apple and other snacks. Great buy and price!",5
Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,"I got this for my dog because it is vinyl and waterproof, I just take the sheet off and wash it and wipe down the bed. Much cheaper than a regular dog bed! I got the fitted sheet for it at Target for $10",5
"Pet Yard Plastic Exercise Pen Expansion Panel, 2-Piece, Gray","I bought two and made this into a baby bed for our new puppy because she banged around all night when we put her in a crate.

"Liying New Designed Fashional Colourful Portable Foldable Rechargeable Eye Protective 24 Leds Charging Table Desk Lamp Light with 800mah Battery - for Reading, Studying, Working, Camping, etc. (green)",Mine did not work right out of the box. The switch seems to be bad. It is cheaply built and I would not recommend it to anybody. Do not buy this item.,1
Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,This could have been better it was a little on the flimsy side and we had to get a replacement.,2
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,im very happy with this carseat. it has everything that i need in it and its very easy to clean and looks very comfortable. we had an older version of the omega elite that had a overhead where you down and just click which worked great but when our daughter got older she learned how to get out of it every time no matter much i tighten the straps so i went shopping for a new carseat and found this one it had good and bad reviews and seems like everyone was complaining about the size of this carseat.  truthfully i think its just perfect. i drive a chevy avalanche and it is just the right size for it. granted if we had to make it rearfacing it would be too big but i dont think that any carseat that is convertable would fit nicely unless you drive a mini van. plus my daughter loves the feature with the cup holder. and most importantly it keeps her in her carseat now and she cant figure out how to get of of this one since its a 5 point and you have to unbuckle two instead of one. so i think this is a great one and i have a 1 month old now and once he gets old enough or he gets to be 20 lbs then im buying another one.,5
Maclaren Mark II Stroller Midnight Navy,"Bought for my 3 year old, 33 lb, 33&#34; son, to take on trip to Europe.  We've been trying it out at malls and general suburban walks.  Had it about two weeks.It is equally as sturdy as my full sized Britax and baby trend jogger I purchased a few years ago.  Wheels are solid and suspension is smooth.  Love the height of the handles.  The handles are a bit harder plastic than I expected.Very easy to collapse and set up.  Carrying strap is great.  Best thing is how sturdy, light and compact this is.  Wish I would have invested in it sooner.Wish I would have purchased the cup holder!",5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Pail System,"We were doing way too much comparison shopping on Diaper Pails, if you're doing the same, here is what you need to know about this one:1. You can't smell old diapers2. Easy to throw out the used bag and simple to get the next one readyWe throw out the bag every 2-3 days, and you can't smell anything.  I haven't left them in there much longer, and you probably won't either.Get this product if you're looking for an affordable diaper pail that traps odors and is easy to deal with.We've purchased the replacement bag inserts, and they're easy to put in and get going.This really is a 5 star product.",5
"HALO SleepSack Plush Dot Velboa Wearable Blanket, Cream, Medium",Very soft and seems to be comfortable. The fabric is nice. It was a lot bigger than I expected it to be but I like that because it will last longer,5
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,"I have no complaints for the installation using the included mounts and screws but I bought this because it was supposed to pressure mount and it just doesn't work that way for me.I found that I needed so much pressure to just hold the door in the door frame that I could no longer open and close the gate.Once I loosened it enough so the gate could open and close the entire door would come out of the frame so I just permanently installed the door with the screws, but the pressure mount system didn't work the way it was intended.",3
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","Great little seat, my 5 month old loves it. We strap it onto a chair sometimes and use it while feeding him (we just started rice cereal). He has lots of fun in it and the two little bowl/cup things are great because they can be pulled out. I gave it 4 stars because it would be nice if the tray part on the front could attach on without the rest of the tray and all the toys on the side, like the bumbo tray, but it doesn't. That being said, I still like it better than the bumbo because my little guy got stuck in that and he fits just fine in this with room to grow, and it has a lot more functionality than the bumbo.",4
Disney Multi-Character Toddler Girl's Panties - 7 Pack-7 Designs (4T),Adorable big girl underpants!  They fit well and feature characters you don't normally see when buying in a brick and mortar shop.,5
Toy Story Cotton Rich Twin Comforter,"I love this blanket. The colors on the picture look pretty blah.... I went along with a review that said that the colors are very vivid and indeed, they are. It is an awesome beautiful blanket for my 4 year old. In his words: &#34;That's so cool! I love it, mommy! Thank you so much!!&#34; It did have a peculiar smell to it and after I washed it a couple of times, it went away. The best part for me, as a mom, is that it doesn't slip and slide falling on the ground or easily kicked towards the footboard. It stays put on him which works for its sole purpose--to keep him warm at night. Yes, I recommend this blanket. I was afraid the quality would not be the greatest, but it is.",5
Cup &amp; Ball Classic Kendama Japanese Eraser. 2 Pack. By PencilThings,I bought a pack of these for each of my 3 kids for Christmas.  My older two are 'obsessed' w/ Kendamas and my little one copies everything they do.  These things are so cute I know my kids will love them!,4
ThumbGuard LG (7-15 yrs.),"My 4 year old daughter would not stop sucking on her thumb, I have tried things in the pastat it would not work. What I liked it actually stayed on her and she never sucked on her thumbever again. I would recommend it to anyone is really works!!",5
"Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","i purchased this car seat, drove with it for several weeks in my car, and loved it so much I purchased another for my husband's car. It's easy to get baby in and out, simple to adjust while baby is seated, and it looks nice. The fabric is very good quality, and it was a cinch to install. I put them both in myself without any help, and when I took them to the fire department to have them double-check the installation, they said I had done it perfectly. I have recommended this seat to several friends with babies, and Amazon has the best pricing I've found.",5
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,Finally a product that is successful in giving babies and young children the relief they need from stuffy gunky noses.For special needs &#34;older&#34; children who physically will never be able to blow their noses effectively this is a heaven sentitem for parents and care takers.,5
"Edushape Edu-Tiles 26 Piece 6x4ft Play Mat, Uppercase Letters","Regardless of the surface (hardwood, tile, carpet) they tend to break apart pretty easily. The material is very soft, but also somewhat thin, so though it does offer some protection the pieces tend to not be sturdy enough to stay together after being walked on a few times. Overall they're pretty good for the price. We use them on hardwoods and ended up taping the back of the pieces together to get them to stay in place, which has worked really well.",4
"Baby Delight Snuggle Nest, Green/White","My husband and I are more than happy with this product, our new born slept great.  She will not sleep in her co sleeper for some reason, but will sleep in it with the snuggle nest.  I think it may have to do with the size making her fell secure.  I read other reviews about the night light music etc... and all I can say is awesome.  The light works great, I was able to tend to my daughters needs without turning every light in the room on.  The size is great and it feels well made and secure, my husband and I are one of those worriers and we where afraid to roll on her.  The snuggle nest lets you rest assured, I sleep great with it to. The only thing I will warn you about is we have a queen bed so it does feel a little cramped however we do not care.",5

Vibrant Butterflies Nursery/Kids' Room Wall Sticker Decals (Glow in the dark),"I bought this it because the 2nd pictures show glow in the dark so cool. Amazon should remove that picture.

"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue",I can't tell you how awesome this tub has been for my newborn.  The hammock feature is terrific for the first few months and when you are sponge bathing.  I am going to be giving this to all I know who are having children.This is about an important to me as having a boppie pillow!!,5
"Graco Travel Lite Crib with Stages, Peyton",The crib is sturdy and looks sharp. We needed a safe place to protect our infant from her enthusiastic brother. The dangly bears are a little pointless. We use a Carter's bassinet fitted sheet which works perfectly.,5
I Play Big Sister/ Little Brother 2-pc. Set - Yellow,We used these for the birth announcement for our son.  It was so cute.  The only thing I had to complain about is the sizes weren't listed when I ordered.  But fortunately the t shirt and the onesie fit.,4
"Carter's Bound Photo Journal Album, Laguna","I am expecting my first child, and wanted to start an album for the baby. I liked this album because according to the pictures it had pages to record information about the pregnancy, parents information, and babies first as well as places to hold photos. I was surprised when I received the album to find that it is not the same one in the pictures. It is just a photo album! The pictures showing the incorrect product should be removed! I will keep the album because it is too much trouble to return it, but it goes to show how helpful it can be to actually see the product you are about to buy!",2
Spray Pal - Cloth Diaper Sprayer Splatter Shield,"Yes, this product prevents splattering when spraying off cloth diapers. But the diaper then needs to stay over the toilet for a bit to drip-dry, and the spray pal will not balance on the toilet seat. I don't really feel like submerging the spray pal in the toilet, because yuck...... I will hang onto it now that I have it but I'm not sure I'd buy it again....",3
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive",These are exactly what I was hoping for! Cute and very eco friendly! Absoluely love the fabric and is excellent quality!,5
The First Years 3 Pack Disney Princess Take &amp; Toss Sippy Cup,"We've long used these Take & Toss sippy cups. They are really convenient to give my son water or juice in a covered cup so we don't have to worry about spills.However this batch of cups I was sent, both Cars and Toy Story had defective covers. My son was constantly complaining that the cups ""didn't work."" After ignoring him for a few days I finally paid attention and discovered that the holes in the top are indeed too small to let any liquid through. I was unable to pull liquid through using all the suction I could generate.Historically these cups have been great for us, but I'd be leery of this batch from this seller. I bought 9 cups and they're now all in the trash.",1
Fisher-Price Zen Collection Cradle Swing,"Hi, while I have NOT opened the box yet I am so excited about this swing.  I think it is gender neutral, and the colors go with any decor of the home.

Carter's Pink Puppy Dog Mommy Loves Me Security Blanket,this puppy is sooo cute! and my daughter likes it as her backup :) She falls asleep by rubbing the edges of these between her fingers and on her face and this ones edges aren't as soft and silky as some of the others.

Kiddobloom Truck Stainless Steel Kids Flatware Set (3-piece),"This came in a beautiful gift box, which was nice on it's own, even before opening the set.

Would definitely buy this again for a gift.",5
Ameda ComfortGel Pads,"I had a lot of tissue damage when I first started breastfeeding, and these were the only thing that didn't stick to my damaged breasts because they contain moisture.  Unfortunately, they don't allow the breasts to breathe, so I think they contributed to thrush.  I didn't get thrush because of them, but they can certainly allow it to develop.  So use with caution.Do not use with lansinoh ointment or anything that adds to the moisture.  ComfortGel Pads do seem to deteriorate after time, so only use for a max of 6 days.",3
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I LOVE this chair. We never bought a high chair, just used this all the way. My daughter is now 1.5 years old and still loves it. I don't use the other two extra trays since the brown tray is so easy to clean anyways. I take this chair everywhere since my daughter climbs out of high chairs. She stays put in this one. I suggest using this as early as possible so your baby is use to sitting in this seat. This way your baby will enjoy it more and will seat in it longer. I love how my daughter is comfortable in it so she is also comfortable at restaurants. It's so easy to clean too! It is definitely one of the best gifts we got. I've seriously considered buying two and putting one in the car so I don't go crazy when I forget to bring it out.",5
"Woombie Convertible Baby Swaddler (Big Baby 14-19 lbs, Little Monster)","My little guy was a challenge the first few months but he wasn't that little!  He had doubled his birthweight by 2 months so the little wraps we had initially were useless very quickly.In desperation we sought out a zipper style swaddler since he was a successful Houdini in the velcro versions.  He could NOT escape the Woombie and I wound up buying one as a gift for someone else having a baby.  It was a lifesaver for much needed naps and nighttime sleep.  He slept like, well, a baby!LOVE LOVE LOVE",5
ALEX&reg; Toys - Bathtime Fun Hoops For The Tub 694,"I bought these for two very bath resistant boys. They took them out of the package and started playing with them before we even got into the tub! They look forward to the bath now so they can play with their ""special"" bath toys.I have a little problem getting the suction cups to stick to the tile walls. We pretty much just re-stick them every night as we're drawing the bath.The hoop is a little small for my kiddos to get the ball into, but that's helping them learn to aim better, so it's not a big deal.The balls are soft enough that it doesn't hurt if (when) they throw them at each other. They bounce pretty easily off the walls too so be prepared to chase them around the bathroom!This was one of three bath toy sets I recently bought to replace old toys and this is the one they want to play with the most.",4

Medela PersonalFit Breastshield Connectors WITH Valves &amp; Membranes,Very satisfied with speed and quality of this. Just as promised. Also... The design of these connectors is new and better in my opinion than the older version. The suction is stronger and has improved my milk production.,5
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia","This is seriously the best baby purchase we made. We leave it in the car all the time, that way if someplace doesn't have a high chair (or they look sketchy) we have something for our daughter to sit in. The pocket in the back is handy for a toy, food, spoon, and bib. It is really sturdy and we haven't found any tables it didn't fit on yet. We've probably used it about 25 times at various places. I haven't had any trouble with the cleaning issues others were having, it wipes up easily and looks great.",5
Fisher-Price Aquarium Take-Along Swing,"There were many advantages to this swing:* Size was good for our small house* Was easy to fold up, or even just carry to different areas of the house, or on trips* My son loved the music and lights* He was really thrilled once he got a little older and realized he could prompt the music by pulling th fish on the sides* It was really helpful early onHowever, there are also several improvements that could be made:* Even from the beginning when my son didn't weigh as much, the swing was slow* It ate through batteries really fast* Once my son was able to sit up, the swing was not really stable enough for him, in fact it really just seemed unsafe at that point.Overall, the swing is good, but won't last as long as a larger, sturdier one.",3
"Stork Craft Modena 4 in 1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, Espresso","So far I love our new crib! It is sturdy, very cute, and quite easy to assemble. I recommend it!",5
"Gund Baby Spunky Plush Puppy Toy Small, Tan","Soft and cute. I will say, I thought it would be a little bigger and stuffed a bit more full, but my daughters just adore this puppy. The other reason I didn't give the complete 5 stars is because the bark button isn't easy to activate.",4
Safety 1st High-Def Digital Monitor,"I'm not usually one to take the time to write a review, but i just have to share how great this monitor is!I was in the same thoughts as alot of other parents were- ""i should get the graco imonitor because it's digital and graco and cool and i will not have any interference and it has a 2000' range""-  So wrong!  i bought the imonitor before the baby was born and tried it out and it failed miserably.  we live in a typically sized suburban neighborhood lot and it barely made it to the end of our driveway without beeping out of service:(So i returned it to target and got the Safety 1st, admittedly doubtful about it's quality bc it wasn't a ""popular"" name brand.  But this monitor is awesome!  For me, it goes about 4 houses over (probably abour 450') and is perfectly clear.  i sometimes have to check to make sure it's still on- it is just that quiet.  yes, the light on the baby monitor does blink when you have the parent monitor off, but i just put my baby monitor on the opposite side of his room (about 12' away) and i can still hear him perfectly clearly on the second volume level.buy this monitor!!  you will love it!!",5

"Fisher-Price Ipad Apptivity Seat, Newborn-to-Toddler",Ummmm no. Just no. You can already stick your kid in the bouncy seat and let em watch tv. Now you don't even need a tv. An ipad will do just fine.,1
"Bummis Bio-Soft Liner, Small",I am new to cloth diapering.  I've ordered this product twice now.  Most of the time the liner works and can catch the solid waste so that I can then dump it and the liner straight into the toilet.  Sometimes it bunches funny and it doesn't catch everything.  I've learned to make sure that the liner isn't sticking out of the diaper.  This will cause leaks.  I just make sure to do a visual scan at the end of a diaper change and tuck it in if it's sticking out anywhere.,4
"Graco Pack N Play Playard with Bassinet, Pasadena","We ordered this crib a few months ago. It is easy to set up and take down. What I like most about this crib is it doesnt have all the """"extras"""" that we will not use.I would recommend using the American Baby sheets not the Graco brand. The American baby sheets are soft and cozy. The Graco sheets feel like sand paper and had to be returned.",5

Jeep Car Seat Travel Bag,"Recently took the baby home for Christmas and we were flying out of NYC where the weather is cold, rainy or snowy in the winter!! I originally bought this because I wasn't comfortable checking my car seat at the gate with nothing because of the thought of germs getting all over the car seat especially when the baby just sits in it with no covers etc.  But am I glad I got it not only because of the germs, but because it was POURING when we landed.  While waiting at the gate on landing it was taking WAY too long for the airline to get us the stroller and car seat - they LEFT IT IN THE RAIN JUST SITTING THERE!! We kept asking for it and FINALLY when we got it everything was SOAKED.  If it hadn't been for this cover the whole car seat would have been drenched and there was NO way I would have put the baby in it.  So glad we had it! It's large enough to stick other things in there too like the car seat rain cover etc as well!",4
360 Degrees Glass Revolving Cake / Dessert Stand - Holds Up to 12&quot; Size Cakes,"This revolving glass stand is inexpensive, but poorly made. The first one I received was completely unusable and required a replacement, which turned out to have the same problem, but not as dramatic. The issue is the the glass top is glued to the rotating part of the stand, and the glue was not allowed to dry completely before it was packaged, so the center slipped, leaving a glue stain and making the top off center. This was the case with the original as well as the replacement, so it doesn't appear to be a one-off situation. I'm keeping the replacement and I'll use it at home, but I won't be taking it to any events and I would not consider trying any of the other products this company offers.",3

"Mimijumi 8 Ounce Baby Bottle, Very Hungry","I ordered this bottle thinking that it would be closest to a breast, but I was very mistaken. My husband filled the bottle with breast milk and turned the bottle upside-down over the sink to show me that the milk just comes streaming out of the nipple. The baby was practically choking when he fed her using this bottle. Even if the nipple were usable, the lid covering the nipple when not in use is almost impossible to get on. You can't really tell which way to face the cover. Sometimes it clicks but it's not really engaged. Hello, leaky bottle with a sub-par cover. I was very disappointed. Needless to say, I'm not ever using this again.",1

7A.M. ENFANT &quot;Blanket 212 Evolution&quot; Extendable Bunting Adaptable for Strollers - Black/Gray,"We have had this product for about a month now in NYC, and it keeps my son very  warm and also seems to improve the quality of his stroller naps when we move him from one location to another.  They don't provide instructions on how to install this anywhere, which I find kind of annoying, so you just have to try to figure it out yourself.  Hence the 4 stars.",4
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","I do love this monitor.  It comes with so many buttons and ways you can use it.  I love being able to move the camera, so if my child moves I can always see them in the camera.  I love that you can turn the volume all the way down if you need so just use the video part.The first downfall is that my house has thick walls and it does get static in certain places.My second downfall is that you can't put 2 cameras on 2 monitors.  I have 2 cameras and 2 handheld monitors and I want to see both my children's cameras on both monitors, but it only allows one camera on one monitor.",4
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow","I use this as a changing pad anywhere and everywhere, and it has gotten well soaked with those between-diaper pees, and never had any go through.

We take the seat with us on vacations, dining out, and visits to the grandparents' homes. Easy to clean, easy to store. Wonderful product!!!",5

"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Purchased this to keep our fat cat away from the food but allowing the other cats to jump over it and eat the food (he is fat enough that he has trouble jumping very high). We didn't realize the determination of this cat to get to his food. Woke up in the middle of the night hearing him scream - turns out he tried to squeeze his fat body through the bars and got stuck. He will stop at nothing to get his food. Got him out without damaging the gate but not without an armful of cat scratches. Promptly returned it the following day.However, the gate is very easy to setup and has a convenient gate built in with an easy-to-use handle. Can be installed without damaging the wall and easily moved. I would recommend this gate to anyone without an animal hellbent on getting food on the other side.",4

"Fisher-Price Cradle n Swing, My Little Lamb","Our daughter has used this swing since she was a week old! She naps in it and we used it for a while to help her get to sleep.  I bought this swing because it could go side to side and front to back and that has come in handy time and time again. She loves to sit up and be upright looking around so having it adjustable to have her sitting up more is also a great feature! Not every baby loves a swing, but this has been worth the money for us!The only problem I have with this swing is it seems to move when you take our baby in and out of the swing. Which isn't a big deal until you turn it on and then it creaks until you adjust the feet/legs again. The noise has never bothered our baby, thankfully, but it drives my husband and I a little crazy.",4
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","My two kids absolutely love this. My six month old uses it as a chew toy (and prefers it over the popular Sophie Giraffe toy), and my two year old has the one without handles. Brushing my two year old's teeth use to be an ordeal because he would cry and fight me, but not since getting him the Baby Banana, he actually asks to have his teeth brushed now!",5

Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,I'm using this for my 2 month old who we just introduced to her crib in her own room just 2 weeks ago.  I actually mounted the camera to the crib using those 3M mounting strips since she doesn't move around yet.  It's working great so far.  When I first started using it I thought it got horrible reception and had to prop the handheld in different positions to get rid of the static. But then I switched to the B channel and it has been perfect.  We can bring it upstairs and downstairs with clear reception.  I love the day and night feature too.  You can have the room pitch black and the camera still works and when there's daylight it's a color screen.  I wish we had this for my first child.,4
Tadpoles Triple Layer Tulle Crib Skirt in White,"Needed a bed skirt that wasn't too bright and didn't have a design cause I didn't want it to clash with the walls or with the sheets that have a pretty busy design.

Gaorui Children Toddler Kid's Leather School Bag Animal Fruit Cartoon Backpack 14 Styles - Ladybug Pattern,"My little toddler loves ducks and thoroughly enjoyed taking it to school to show his teacher.  It is really cute, but really small.  He can only fit a small sippy cup in it along with a small zippered pencil pouch, but he still loves it and that counts for a lot with a toddler!",4
"Trend Lab Dr Seuss Messenger Style Diaper Bag, Cat in The Hat","I was looking for a cute, durable diaper bag that was not the size of a house. I love this bag and have gotten many compliments on it. It has three large size pockets in it for bottles, a zippered inner pouch, a mesh divider and a fairly large inside. The diaper bag is about the size of an average messanger bag. It can hold several items of clothing, diapers, wipes, shoes. A perfect bag for on the go. Not big enough to carry a medium to heavy blanket.After I had this bag for about a year, the strap broke off and the threads started coming apart. Still very cute, but definitely not as durable as I originally reported.",3
Chewbeads Charles Bangle - Punchy Pink,"I ordered this ChewBead bracelet after my 6 month old daughter loved the Jane Necklace so much.  I was a little worried at how fashionable this would actually look, when it came I could not have been happier more importantly, my daughter LOVES it.  It is wide enough for her to hold and play with while think enough for her to chew on.  I would absolutely recommend this to friends.",5
Bright Starts Peek-A-Zoom Toy,"The first day out of the package and the sound/music stopped playing.  I replaced the battery thinking it was dead but noticed that the coils in the battery box were scalding hot.  The new batteries didn't make it work either.  Additionally, the knobs for the characters to pop up are pretty hard.  1 of the knobs is even hard for me to press much less a child.  Do not buy!",1
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"Entertaining, Durable, and Lasting. I bought this, it held up through twins, then a third child, and has been since passed to another baby! We have gotten our monies worth!",5
"Dream On Me 2 in 1 Lightweight Folding Portable Stationary Side Crib, Cherry","This portable crib is okay but it was missing 2 screws when I went to assemble it. Because the pad, not worthy of being called a mattress, that comes with it was so thin, I purchased a replacement one that measured exactly what the directions said it should and it was too small. The crib itself is solid & sturdy and easily portable as promised. My needs were for a smaller, permanent bed for baby in a smaller apartment & I don't think this was the best choice for my needs.",3
"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red",great buy This is nice stroller and design was  a very face ship and would buy again. This is a great deal.,5
"Joovy Spoon Walker, Greenie","I was worried if this would be tall enough for my daughter. She is 5 months and off the charts in height (28 inches). We just got the walker and it is currently in the middle height setting. In the tallest height setting her feet don't touch the floor, so I know we have a few more months for her to use this. The tray is nice and deep and I see many Cheerios in our future being placed and gobbled up on it. Right now we just have suction toys on top because there is the plastic tray insert. Easy to switch from the ""play"" tray to the ""eating"" tray so the walker is awesome for cleaning! Very sturdy walker that all of my babies will be able to use and love. Worth every penny (and I know this walker costs a lot of pennies), but I am very thrilled with it.",5

"Graco TotBloc Pack 'N Play with Carry Bag, Bugs Quilt","Wallyworld had this at the same price, but they were out of stock. The shipping was free, but I still didn't have to wait very long for it to arrive. This one is probably the biggest ""playpen"" any one can find. My son loves it! It's big enough for him to roll around in.",5
"Badger Basket 3 Pack Polka Dot Nesting Trapezoid Shape Folding Baskets, Pink","This product got mostly great reviews for a child's room.  I received them and am satisfied with the quality and size of the baskets.  For the price it is a good deal and from what other people say, they will last.",5
"Lansinoh mOmma Mealtime Warm Plate, Green","This plate is wonderful for keeping baby and toddler food warm while they sometimes take so long to eat, it's so easy, just add hot water from the tap into the hole, put the plug in, and add the food, let it warm up a bit, and serve.  I bought my daughter this one and the &#34;green sprouts Warming Plate&#34; as an alternative to keep in her diaper bag for travel.  She loves them both. ~~D.Maher  New England",5

High quality material and they are really well made. I've also had them do some custom work and they are accommodating!,5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","As men we have to admit that wearing a baby carrier can be well, interesting.  Once we received this carrier it was imediately put into action.  With an active 2.5 year old it is a must to keep two hands free as often as possible and this carrier works very well.  My son, who was 2 months old at the time, fell asleep in the carrier within minutes and loved it.  Because I am a very warm blooded person I wanted to get something that would not make me to hot...again this is the ticket.  So far so good and I would recommend any guy(reluctant or not) or woman to try this out.",5
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"For my 1st child, I used a regular ice cube tray but I hated to pop them out of the trays because I always manged to scatter the cubes all over the counter and floor or I wouldn't transfer them to baggies because i dreaded the process of popping them out. Then the baby food would taste like all the other items I had in the freezer. For my 2nd child I bought these to give them a try. With this lid, I just twist the trays, place the lid back on loosely and tip it over. Voila! No more scattered cubes. Also if I don't get to popping the cubes out for a few days, they don't absorb the flavors of everything else. The food also doesn't get stuck in the trays and break apart like they do with any ice cube trays I have used. Maybe I'm uncoordinated when it comes to ice cube tray because I've never had any luck with any kinds ever. It's one of the reasons why I don't have ice in my household! After my baby starts eating more table food, I just might store ice cubes in the freezer again with these trays.",5

"Itzbeen Pocket Nanny Baby Care Timer, Blue","I finally weaned myself off of this timer once my twins turned 1. It is true that it is not a necessity, but it is handy when your exhausted. My twins were born at 24 weeks so when they finally came home from the NICU we had a tight schedule to follow. Medications, pumping times, feeding, etc. I am glad we bought 2 of these because not having to watch the clock was just once less thing my sleep addled brain had to deal with.",5

"Bright Starts Comfort and Harmony Portable Swing, Florabella","I really love this swing & so does my baby girl! The music really puts her to sleep & i love the way it reclines into diffrent positions. The diffrent speeds are great too, high speed helps her fall asleep & medium or low she stays alseep! The only problem was installing the toy bar, i saw alot of complaints about that from other moms as well. Instead of requesting another i unscrewed it & fixed it myself( very simple to do). This is why i only gave it 4 stars, if not  for that problem i'd def rate it at 5!",4
"KF Baby Finger Pinch Guard [Set of 5], with kilofly Refrigerator Magnet",I ordered because I have a very active toddler and it is working marvelous... And now I leave my baby walk around the house an don't be afraid that he is going to lose a fingernail o get hurt....,5
"Peg Perego Pliko Four Stroller, Geranium","Let me start by saying I like the stroller, but i have some irritating issues with it that I would like to pass on.  First the front locking mechanisms by the basket have to be manually pushed in to the locked position every time.  This makes one handed setup hard. Second, the basket under the stroller cant be accessed from the back because of a poorly placed support bracket.  Lastly, the release handles have the feel of cheap plastic.  All in all its higher quality than most brands, but could have been built better.",4
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,Having used a few other hand pumps in the past I was really skeptical about trying another. If it hadn't been for the positive reviews I wouldn't have tried.This pump is PERFECT for my needs. I only need a bottle here and there when I go out or to mix with baby cereal. I think it's fast and well worth the price. Don't waste your money with other brands. This is a keeper!,5
Maclaren MacSac Changing Bag - Storm Gray,"I own this bag and actually love it.  I love how roomy it is.  I can get quite a few cloth diapers in there, wipes, and all my babies stuff without it being too full.  The outside zippered pocket is easily accessed and I love the water bottle pocket on the side.  I breastfeed, so I don't need the big insulated pocket for a bottle, but it is perfect for my little guy's snacks.The previous reviewer did not mention that while the top is closed with a drawstring, there is a flap that goes over that and buckles securely.  I have never had an issue with anything falling out.Also, the zippered compartment on the bottom can be opened without having to lay the whoile bag on its side.  I just lean it back and grab the pad out.  In fact, I see this as a great design since the pad is stored in the bottom, it does not take up any room in the bag, and it is stored away from my clean stuff.And finally (and very importantly), it is comfortable!! The straps are wide and padded.  My husband will wear the baby in the Ergo while I carry the diaper bag on my back when we go strollerless which is often.  I love how it is gender neutral too in case we decide to switch.  :)",5

I think this was a wise investment.",5
"Tiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friends","I had wanted to get a mobile for my son who is almost 3 months old. He is just now getting to the point where he will watch it, but I really like this little mobile. It is bright and colorful, the music is great on it and I love the fact that you can turn off the music and still have it go around. I also love the fact that it fits on his pack'n play! That is the main reason I bought it. We are living in a small space and so he hasn't been able to move to a crib just yet so this is perfect! I haven't tried putting it on the stroller or on his carseat but I am thrilled with the fact that it is so versatile.5 stars from me! I thought it was a little pricey but it is well worth the money!",5

Trend Lab Paisley Park 4 Piece Crib Set,"I always look for two things first before buying any item:1. It has to be stylish/pleasing to the eyes.2. It has to be above average quality.The Chibi bedding set surpassed both the expectations. My girlfriend selected it after viewing/reviewing a lot of bedding sets for our first child. She wanted to make it perfect and has been extremely happy with the purchase. The blanket is super soft and very nicely made. Bumpers are thick and yet soft to protect the babies from hitting themselves against the crib.The animals with over-sized heads and eyes look really cute, so says my girlfriend :) The bedding set is reasonably priced compared to some other bedding sets we looked at. And with Amazon's legendary packaging and shipping, we received our set super fast.In all, we are extremely satisfied with the purchase.",5

"Dutailier Horseshoe Back Design 2 Post Glider Multiposition, Recline and Ottoman Combo, Light Brown",We received the package in great condition and no damage. Unit was packaged very well.  Instruction sheet was lacking.  We were able to assembly the ottoman ok but when it came to the handles on the chair it was rather vague which handle was left and right.  After 2 or us looking at the instructions we put the handles on --reversed.  To remove the handles it not a good thing--they are mounted on metal mounts with plastic rivets which once in place do not come off.  we have made contact with the vendor to see what we can do..  This model of chair has a central spine support which tends to push you out of the seat a little but that maybe corrected as time goes on and we form the seat. The mechanism works great and its very smooth in operation in all positions,4
Maxi-Cosi Mico Infant Car Seat - Total Black,"After having a graco for 3 years, I tried this car seat because of the cotton, more breathable fabric, because my 3rd baby was so sweaty and fussy in my graco. This seat wasn't any different! My baby was still sweaty. I hated the way the seat clicked out of base...hard to do compared to graco. I also didn't like the buttons to move the handle. They were awkward to click in order to move the handle. I also thought the seat was too narrow. I have a 2 month old and his head hit the sides of the seat....not much room to grow! The sides of the seat are higher too, so babys visual field is limited compared to graco. I ended up returning this seat and buying the graco snug ride with a cotton cover...I am much happier. Baby still gets a little sweaty, but at least I don't have the other negatives. And I don't think there is any car seat out there that is totally breathable. I searched everywhere, and this maxi cosi definitely seemed the closest, but still failed.",2
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Percale Ruffle Crib Skirt, Celery","I love this crib skirt now that its on.  It was a bit of a beast to iron though, all of those little pleats make it almost impossible to make creases.",4
Disney Cars Soft Potty Seat - Black/Red,"This potty seat was horribly designed, for boys at least. After my son goes pee on the potty, I have to lift the cushion off the seat. The pee seems to collect under the cushion. If my son takes it off the potty before I clean it up, pee leaks out of it all over the floor. My sons seat does have a different splash guard on it than the one pictured, maybe that will make a difference.",1
"Peace of Mind Two 900 Mhz Baby Receivers, Monitor","I registered for this monitor because of the two receiver feature and because the 900 mHz technology was supposed to be the best.  We already used the Fisher Price prenatal to nursery monitor during my pregnancy, but we thought that this one would be better for everyday use.  From day one there was static, but I just thought that all monitors must do that.  It got worse with time- neither channel would come in clearly (the second channel never did work), we would get a loud static noise about every 30 seconds that was impossible to sleep through, and it would pick up phone conversations from our neighbor every night at midnight.  Still, we figured it was because we lived in a subdivision with several neighbors and baby monitors.  However, the real test was when we visited my husband's parents at their country home.  There are NO neighbors there, nothing to interfere, and the monitor was still so full of static that we couldn't hear our son.  Finally, one night out of desperation we pulled out the old Fisher Price monitor.  It was totally static-free, and we are still using it.  The ""Peace of Mind"" monitor will go in the trash.",1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",Was completely adorable and is so cool the way it projects stars on the ceiling. It also had a little story and pictures to find in the stars. Absolutely loved it.,5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","Love their products.  Our son's been in halo sleepsacks since he was 1 month old.  Back then he used the swaddlers, then transitioned over at about 4 months to a newborn sleep sack, then to a small.  And now we're onto the medium sizes.  Crazy how they grow.This is a really cute print.  I love the light turqoise-ish color with cute little owls on it.  This sleep sack has served us well.  Durable, breathable and best of all, safe.  I think my son's so used to having a sleep sack on, I don't know what he'll do when we eventually switch to a blanket!We however, live in CA and get 100+ degree weather here during the summers and I just wish that halo also makes a thinner muslin version of this sleep sack for the really hot weather places.  Make a muslin version to compete with aden and anis please!",5
Fisher-Price Cruisin' Motion Soother,"I am not saying the product itself is bad, it's just that my son didn't take to it at all.",3
"Lamaze Cloth Book, Panda's Pals","Baby (4 mos) took interest to this soft book, but the peek a boo flaps go all over the place.  So its hard for her to see whats going on, as the book is hard to hold.  I try to show her the pages, but it just flops all over the place.",3
Body Polish Vanilla Cardamom By Trillium Organics,"I always order this brand of salt scrub not this scent. It sounded like it would smell delicious, it wasnt.  It smells like lemon spice cake. Yuk.  I will stick with the warming scent from now on.",2
"Aurora Baby Blessings Wind Up Musical Plush, Lamb","It is the cutest thing ever! Great size, I actually thought it would be smaller. I love how easy the turnkey is. My 1 month old nephew will love it!",5
"green sprouts Wooden Brush and Comb Set, Natural","All other brushes were a little to rough for my 10 month old and his soft hair, this brush is so soft and gentle, he loves getting his hair brushed.",5
Protect-a-Bub Deluxe 3-in-1 Sunshade - Single - Black,"I like this product. It works as promised. I have a Jogging stroller and this item works great with the frame (baby trend). My girlfriend purchased this too but returned it as she did not like it for her phil and ted's stroller. the frame and ties did not match up well - she likes the shade that comes with that brand.Back to protect-a-bubit seems hard to work with at first, but if you fool with it - and give yourself time (not when you expect to go for a walk) to try it out - you'll love it.I have the 3 position shade and all work well. My baby fusses when the shade is down unless i adjust it so he can see out - again, just tinkering with the stroller and item to figure out what works best for you.i live in chicago - and we get some serious wind around these streets and the protect - a - bub stays on and does not blow around like others - i think because it's breathable.the material is soft and stretchy. the shaping wire (or whatever is used to create the curved shape) is flexible which is nice for adjusting it or not breaking it.I have not used the dark over/3rd postion, it just seems too much or in the summer when your strolling around, like it will be too hot. I'm sure i'll use it in the winter.",4
Beco Gemini Baby Carrier - Paige,"As far as structured carriers, I bought an Ergo and I really liked it (very comfy), but baby couldn't face out and spent the whole time craning her neck and trying to face out.  I began shopping around for one that had a front carry option.  It came down to the Beco and the Baby Bjorn.  I hadn't heard great things about the Bjorn (uncomfy/painful and not a great carry for baby), so I decided to give this a shot.  So far, I love it!  It's got the same padded shoulder straps and wide waist belt as the Ergo, so it's really comfy and doesn't hurt my back (baby is about 15 pounds now).  She LOVES being able to face out!  Supposedly there are a bunch of carry options - on the front, hip, and back and on the front, the baby can face in or out.  I haven't tried the rest of the positions yet, but I will at some point.  It's also pretty easy to put on and off on my own:)  Which is another crucial thing!  I would highly recommend it!",5
Kidco Door Knob Lock - Clear - 2,Not great. My daughter was able to figure out how to squeeze them to open the doors on the first attempt.,2
"Starting Small Monkey Novelty Hamper in Brown,  18 x 11 x 24",I love this hamper. Haven't used it yet due to the fact my son will not be born until the end of October. But it goes with his monkey theme perfectly. It is so cute and reasonably priced.,5
"Waterproof Feeder Bib w/Flip Pocket, 3 Pack, Boy, Frenchie Mini Couture",Cute waterproof bibs. Patterns are true to picture. Easily wipes clean. Soft material. Perfect for baby that is just starting to eat food.,5
"Bebek Next 8 Ounce Safari Insulated 3D Sports Sipper Cup, Blue",I ordered this for my daughter who is 9 months. So far she isn't using it but it's exactly what I expected and this will be her first Straw Cup. It's super cute and easy for her to hold. She plays with it right now with water in it while she gets used to it.,5
Levana Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery and Talk to Baby Intercom,"As a first time mom, I'm really nervous about putting the baby in her crib in her nursery. I wanted a quality video monitor that wasn't going to break the bank and this is it! The night vision works great as well as the two way talk feature. I also love being able to adjust the microphone volume for the camera. My daughter squeaks a lot in her sleep and the monitor comes back on every 5 minutes but adjusting the sensitivity has allowed us to sleep more soundly and only be alerted to her loud &#34;awake&#34; noises. Definitely recommend!!!",5
"Bumkins Waterproof Zippered Wet Bag, Blue Cat",We use this for flannel baby wipes and dirty clothes as well as soaked bibs. We've never had a problem with it leaking or smelling or anything. We never leave home without it! Its great!,5
Chicco C5 Umbrella Stroller,"We purchased this stroller last fall when our 26M old daughter sustained a fracture in her tibia and needed a nice sturdy stroller for a few weeks. We loved it then and we love it now.This stroller is very lightweight and versatile. It's so easy to handle and manuever as well. Our daughter was around 36"" tall and 26lbs when we got it and she fit it perfectly comfortably. She's now about 38"" tall (guesstimate) and 33lbs and she's still comfy in it when we go out for walks, go to the zoo, etc. It's still just right for her. We have NEVER had a moment's trouble out of this stroller and it's been through many miles with us.The only drawback I can find is that there is no cupholder. What I do is put water bottles or cups in the pocket that is on the back of the canopy or put them in the basket underneath. So, really, while I'd like a cupholder, not having one is not a dealbreaker for me. No biggie. ;)I'd definitely recommend this stroller without reservation or hesitation.",5
"OXO Tot Plate, Green",Nice plate.  The sides help little hand scoop food onto the spoon or fork.  The rubber bottom helps keep the plate from sliding around.  Dishwasher safe--that's a good thing.  We use these plates along with the OXO spoon and fork set.  These products are a little pricey--that would be my one complaint.  But they work well for my toddler so we've bought a couple of sets.,5
"Munchkin Designer Diaper Change Kit, Colors May Vary",I was in need of a safe place to change my baby since every coffee shop i visited had no baby changing stations....i was sooo pleased with this product and buy munchkin items all the time!!!,5
"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack","We use these daily, they have stayed put when wrapped around the foam/rubber part of our Bugaboo handle.  I think we overloaded one once to the point that the stitching tore out and the hook fell off, our fault most likely.  A good cheap investment in making life easier and keeping your hands free for more important baby/toddler tending duties.",4
"The First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce","Since my son was a major spit-upper and was having problems latching fully to a bottle, the breastflo bottles were the best choice. All other bottles he would have milk coming out the side but not these. Love them",5
BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Bassinet,"This bassinet is lightweight, folds up nicely and the locking mechanisms are a plus. The only drawback for us so far is it doesn't sit flat on a hard surface (such as hardwood floors). The elbow joints on the long sides don't open quite wide enough for the bassinet to sit level on its own, so it rocks a little. I'm sure it won't be a problem with the weight of a baby in it, but it's a little disappointing.",4
Elegant Baby Bath Toy Set - Frog,My daughter loves this in the bath with her.  They are very cute and a fun toy that we also gave as a gift and that child loved as well.,5
Graco True Focus Digital Video Monitor,"I love love love love this monitor!  We live on a farm and I love that I can go to chores while my little one sleeps and I can see and hear him the whole time!  The clip is molded into the monitor and over all this unit seems really sturdy.I can't think of anything I don't like about it.  :)It may not have all the bells and whistles some of the other monitors have, but if you're a parent who wants to be able to step outside for a minute and still keep an eye on your baby, this one will do a great job.",5
Happi Tummi Removable Waistband - Blue,"My 7 week son has had horrible gas and colic, lasting several hours and ruining the routine that was set because he was in so much pain. I have given him gas drops, gripe water, massaged his stomach, and did the ""bicycle"" with his legs. (Everything except for the ""bicycle"" worked his large intestine, but never solved the problem because the gas was building in the small intestine.) But this is a product you have to try it at least once for your infant! Do it for the baby's relief, and to restore lost sleep to both you and your baby! It worked around 10 seconds for my son, and was so fast, I was trying to figure out my baby's ""new expression""- not realizing he actually went straight from screaming his lungs out to falling asleep after putting it around his waist. You will not be disappointed!!",5
Sunshine Kids Travel Blanket - Red Plaid,I have used this blanket for a while now with my potty training daughter.  I had no problem with it like the other reviewer did.  Worked great and functioned exactly as I thought it would.  Great buy!!,5
"Thirsties Duo All in One Cloth Diaper, Blackbird, Size One (6-18 lbs)","I love this diaper! I only bought one to try out, along with a few other brands and a pack of Kushies... the Kushies are AWFUL. I've used fuzzybunz, bumgenius, and gdiapers in the past, and so far this is one of my favorites. It is easier than gdiapers (though I really love those for the absorbency and trimness), and much less bulky than bumgenius.",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",Son in law is a big man and it is extremely tight on him!! I wonder if they sell an extension!!,3
Fisher-Price Adorable Animals Baby's Bouncer,"This is the first thing I recommend to new moms.  It is inexpensive, but a life saver to keep small babies off the floor or couch and somewhere safe.",5
Peg-Perego Aria Rain Cover,"We've used this rain shield four or five times now, and I'm amazed at how well it fits and works. It snaps on easily, wraps under my son's feet at the bottom so that they stay dry, and the vents on the side seem to breathe enough that he doesn't get fussy. I do wish that it was a bit easier to fold and stow, but I'm willing to deal with the bulkiness for the way it holds it's shape for great fit. Just know ahead of time, that you won't be folding up the stroller with this in the cargo hold underneath.",5
MilkCharm - The Breastmilk Labeling Charm (Pack of 3),"Amazing. I was doing the masking tape routine to label my bottles, but this is much easier. I only use the side with the days of the week. It would've been nice, perhaps, if the flip side were calendar days, as I do not time stamp my breast milk.",5
"Planet Wise Wet Diaper Bag, Black, Small",This is the bag I use in my laundry room to store the wet diapers for the couple days between washings (I have a small pail next to the changing pad) to keep them contained.  It easily fits 2-3 days of cloth diapers for my kid (about 10 a day) and contains the smell nicely.  I throw it in with the diapers every couple of washes and it smells fine after about 6 weeks of daily use.,5
"green sprouts Silicone Toddler Spoon, Green","It's my first baby and we just started solids so i don't have a lot to compare it to, but i love this spoon so much I have ordered 4.  I love the ergonomic feel of it, and it kind of flexes so if he grabs it it ""gives"" instead of flinging back at me and spraying food everywhere.  Was worried it would be too big for 6 month old but it's working just fine -- it's nice and shallow so I can control the amount of cereal per bite really well.  Love it!",5
"Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White",I have been using this pillow right from day one in the hospital. Its very comfortable to feed your baby using the pillow. My son is a month old and fits well on the pillow. I really liked the print and bought it so my son would find it interesting when he rests on it and does tummy time later on. The slip cover is easy to remove and wash. Its a good purchase,5
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),3 of these for the price was a great value. We like them! See well made and fairly durable! Thanks!,4
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink",I bought this for my sisters baby and it is so cute.  She is in the military and travels a lot so this seat is perfect for her to bring with her.,5
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Newborn Rock 'N Play Sleeper, My Little Sweetie","We bought this from my hospital room after my water broke 10 weeks early because we knew we would need someplace for our bundle of joy to sleep when we brought her home, We have been using this almost exclusively for 9 months. (Safety note: you're not supposed to use it once your baby can sit on their own or is crawling.)",5
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","Gets its job done, but I hate the nipple cleaner. It is a piece of rubber and you have to screw and unscrew it from the bottle brush... I like those that you just pull out the brush.The only thing I like about this brush is that it stands.",3
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"Washing bottles has never been easier!  This has been an easy way to clean bottles in a matter of minutes versus waiting for the dishwasher or hand washing them- so easy my husband helps all the time!  This item is also great for traveling and you can even sterilize other itmes as pacifiers, plastic spoons etc.  Just becareful when you open the unit not to burn yourself with the hot water.  Another helpful tip- when drying the bottles, cloth diaper rags work great.",4
SnugRide Infant Car Seat - Emerson,We Bought a DuoGuilder LXI and it came with a infant carrier...but no weather boot Protecter...which is nice cause we think its to much of a big deal to put that on in the winter time /cold weather  i think the infant carrier is going to be better then the one from EB line which is crap cause it did not level safely in her car. THIS IS a nice infant carrier and i do not have to carry it by the bottom like her old car seat!!our duoguilder is working great as a single stroller... and the infant carrier is much safer then the one old which i had to carry his car seat..,5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"I considered this toy for my 9 1/2 month old granddaughter after reading other reviews about it first.I am so glad that I made this purchase as she enjoys playing with. Her 7 yr old sister will wiggle it around for,and help her to push on the different areas to hear the music, sounds, etc... and she giggles the whole timethey play together.",5
"PBnJ baby Paci Holder, Big Pink/Purple Dots",We received this product prior to its estimated delivery date in great condition. The paci holders are SO pretty in person and work just as described! I went ahead and hand washed them as directed. I let them air dry and they dried very quickly. My husband and I are very pleased with this product and look forward to using them when our twin baby girls arrive!,5
Bears Baby Month Stickers for Bodysuit #6,"These are stickers, what other review do you need?  Fast shipping, great price, great packaging protects the stickers from being folder or even rolled up.  Great product, would buy more if we need to, but we do not want to have more kids ;)",5
"Motorola Blink1 Wi-Fi Video Camera for Remote Viewing with iPhone and Android Smartphones and Tablets, Red","This product is really good. I was given a test sample to put through the paces in my home. A new baby here really got me excited about using it. The set up is easy. The Android app is simple to down load and so far, has worked seamlessly on my phone. I love the fact that I can be anywhere in the house and since my phone is with me all the time, I can check on our my new son at any time, anywhere. I can even see great applications for this product as a remote security camera by simply moving the camera to a place in the house we want to watch when we are all gone.The ability to move the viewing of the camera from my phone is really great. I like that I can zoom in to seeing a close up of my son when he's sleeping or just moving around in his crib. Sounds weird, but it gives me one more connection to know that he's Ok, and keeps me feeling safe.Great Job on this product, Motorola! Love it.",5
Gerber White Training Pants 18 Month 6 Pair,"Now that my son is fully potty trained, he wears these as underwear.  The padding up front offers more protection than regular boys underwear.  If he has a little leak, this can help contain it so we don't have to change his pants too.  It didn't really work as a potty training tool with the vinyl pant covers.",4
Maxi Cosi Mico Car Seat Base,"I bought the carrier before I realized the base had been recalled. I called Maxi-Cosi and they sent me a new base. Well, it seems they just send you another of the same and not a good functioning product. The new one I use clicks before the seat is completely in. Sometime it takes lots of manipulation to get the back to lock in the carrier. I think safety is still a concern with this product.I have to make sure it is well locked in every time which is not great when you are in a hurry.",2
"SOHO Pink Camo Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case, Reservable use of both comforter and bumper (starts at 5/5/14)",I love it although the back of the comforter is polka dots. It had everything it said it did plus was so adorable,5
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,"Our one-month-old just started showing an interest in his toys, so we decided to get this gym as an early Xmas present for him. What a great purchase - all of the other glowing reviews are absolutely right!! He loves to stare at himself in the mirror (he will do it for literally over an hour!), and he also enjoys the red bird and the ladybug. He is too small still to grab the toys or make the star play  music on its own (it's motion activated), but he reaches out to the toys and the mirror and he &quot;talks&quot; to them. As a new parent, it's tremendously exciting to see these toys interest him. I wish there was a way to make the music play continuously, but other than that, this gym (and all baby Einstein products that we've found) is super!",5
"Bright Starts Comfort and Harmony Portable Swing, Florabella","Perfect from Amazon for a new granddaughter 600 miles away. Next-day-delivery expensive, but necessary and effective. She loves her swing.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"I ordered this jumperoo based on the number of great reviews and I am so glad I did. This jumperoo has so much to keep baby busy. They have plenty of things to touch and explore on this jumperoo which gives me lots of time to make dinner, clean up or SHOWER!!! Great Item, very pleased that I purchased it. I have a feeling my daughter will enjoy this item for months to come since there are toys on it she has yet to discover. Also, it's so fun that the music is not even necessary to keep babies attention, which is also nice because no matter how pleasant the sounds are, they get to you after a while. ;-) Great item, glad I bought it!",5
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,"I got one of those double electric pumps through my insurance company, and used it most of the time I needed to pump for the first 5-6 months or so (went back to work when the baby was 6 weeks old, so that's a fair amount of pumping).  I ordered this initially because sometimes I needed to travel somewhere for work that meant I was in a car for quite a while and unable to get back to a place I could be alone with a power outlet by the time I needed to pump again.  I used it only on occasion, and exclusively for that purpose, for the first few months I had it.  Lately, though, I noticed my ability to pump enough milk had been dropping quite a bit.  I took one of those trips out of town and saw that I was able to get more with this pump.  I have now simply put the electric pump away, as using this pump is not only quieter and less uncomfortable, but I actually end up with more milk for the baby than I did with the electric one.Sorry, can't do 5 stars for a breast pump.  Pumping is no fun.",4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,"We got the superyard (or, as I call it, the &quot;Steel Cage Death Match&quot; yard) to contain our child in the living room and den while we are working. This is our experience. Your mileage may vary.Plus side: The fence itself is robust and basically indestructable. In it's four or five sided form, it's very stable, even against toddler rage! (&quot;Attica, Attica!&quot;) The sides can be taken apart, to make smaller areas.Minus side: the folding and locking mechanism is very stiff, and I was afraid I was breaking it at first when I was opening it up. So far it's not too much of a problem. The whole system is pretty heavy, and not nearly as portable as they try to tell you. Also, it's pretty clunky and large, so once it's up, we keep it up. The major downside is the price. Ack.",4
Evenflo Take Me Too Express Tandem Stroller - 3 Little Bears,"Very sturdy,good quality. This is a great stroller, I love it! It has a wonderful parent tray that holds 2 cups and two other small areas to put other things(keys,phones,ect). It also has wet wipe dispenser with a storage compartment under it!!!You can use your car seat if you have a small baby, and there is plenty of room in the basket to carry a lot of stuff! This stroller is very easy to push and steer, but it is kinda heavy and large when folded. you can put an older toddler in the front seat(I have a 2 yr old) but you probably wont be able to use the visor because it is designed for a smaller child i suppose. This stroller is well worth the money, and is probably the cheapest one you'll find( I've searched a lot! :).",5
Custom Baby Girl Bedding - Pink Safari 14 PCS Crib Nursery Set Include Music Mobile,"I purchased this for my daughter & son-in-law for their nursery.  She was looking for something with the safari print in pink & I found this set!  She loved it, it was the style she was looking for!  The set included so many cute items that helped finish off the nursery!  Also I was able to get a pillow with the baby's name on it which makes it extra special!  We are very happy with this bedding set!",5
"Protect-a-Bub Single Compact Sunshade, Black",Bought 2 of these shades for my twin boys.. We have 2 canopy strollers from Babies R Us & these shades fit well on them..,4
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink","Perfect for my toddler grandchildren.  Easy to install, use and clean.  Highly recommend this if you have little ones.  Comes in several colors.",5
Superyard Colorplay Ultimate Playard,I just adopted two  week old scottish terriers and the gate makes it so much more accessible in getting them in and out.,5
Fisher-Price Constant Motion Plug-In Swing - Circus Plaid,"I wanted this swing for the plug in feature and I like the neutral colors. My baby was born an average 7 1/2 lbs but the swing was too strong for her at first. Her head was fine with a towel roll, but the swing swung too fast or hard. She didn't like it at all. However, now that she is older and bigger (around 9 lbs now), it's perfect. The lowest setting is the perfect speed and amount of ""swing"" for her and she definitely likes it now. I don't know what the other reviewers are talking about when they say it swings too slow even at the fastest setting. Over all would definitely recommend for someone who wants to save on the batteries!",4
"Dapper Snapper Baby &amp; Toddler Adjustable Belt- Boy's Colors: Navy, Beige and Black","I searched high and low for a belt to fit my skinny 2 year old, and any that I found, he hated! It was getting expensive to only buy pants with an adjustable waist, so I went searching for a solution. These are PERFECT! They tighten his jeans just enough to stay up, but he doesn't even feel it, and it's not interfering with his potty training. I'm so glad I went ahead and got a three pack of these! People ask me about his ""belt"" all the time, and I'm all to happy to share with them! Genius idea, I will definitely be buying these as gifts in the future for all of my mommy friends!",5
NUK Barely There Nipple Shield with Case,"she said that they didn't stick on as well as the avent ones, so then i had to get a bunch of those ones instead.  they are triangle shaped.  who's ever seen a triangle shaped nipple?  somebody might've but I can't recall personally having done so.  crazy triangle nipple shields....",3
"Combi Cocorro Lightweight Convertible Car Seat, Carrot Cake","I purchased this car seat because it is reviewed as being easy to install in a sedan with multiple car seats, and because I have had success with Combi items in the past. This car seat is nearly impossible to install safely because it tips up easily while in the rear-facing position. I have tried installing it using the latch system as well as the seat belt and have the same problem. I can't use the lower seat tether in my Prius, as it doesn't have one and have tried recommendations of other reviewers, as far as using a pool noodle or a towel to help secure the seat.My husband, in his haste to be tidy, has thrown away the box, or I would return this car seat. As it is, I'm going to try to sell it on Craigslist, and will go out and buy a less-expensive, more secure seat at Walmart.I am terribly disappointed.",1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","Overall, I really like this product. It gives me the freedom to not be attached to this pump as much! The only thing that I do not like is that it is a little bulky. I wish I could be able to wear it under clothes inconspicuously. Other than that, I wish I would have found this sooner! I definite must!",4
"Bummis Pull On Diaper Cover (Small 8-18 pounds, Tangerine)",Our 7 month old had no problems transition to cloth diapers b/c we found great comfortable combinations for him.  We use bulky fitted diapers and these bummis pull ons are roomy.  They don't pinch his chunky thighs but still cover the big fitted diapers in entirety.  Easy on the pocketbook too.,5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",This is pretty easy to use.  I strapped it to a chair when I got it and haven't taken it off since.  My 5 month old son can easily sit up in it (when he's strapped in) and the tray is easy to attach and remove.,5
"WubbaNub Infant Plush Pacifier - Limited Edition Set (Cutsie Caterpillar, Ella Bella Elephant, God Bless Lamb)","I was skeptical about these for the cost & if my son would even like them but its the only pacifier he likes. He doesn't even like the Soothie by itself. My son is a thumb sucker from the womb & fusses to be able to suck his thumb, arm, or my neck, but he scratches himself so much I'm glad to use these to protect his face more. They are easy to clean & sterilize, directions are on wubbanubs website too btw.",5
Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy,"I was told by lots of people this worked for the baby jogger city select... it doesnt. The canopy from the seat makes it so it tilts / like this when attached. not very good when you have a drink in it. I actually got my money back, but I could see it being good for another stroller.",3
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","We love it, pretty basic change pad cover, it works for us, easy to wash and clean! fits the standard change pad",5
Graco SnugRide 32 Base in Tan,Great for an extra car seat base for my husband's car.  I have a Graco Car Seat.  Comes with the extra tight belt that clips to some car's hooks in the inner part of the seat.  Love it!,5
Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Silicone Nipple - Fast Flow - 2 Pack,"my baby chews on her bottle nipples/ avent. but this one, no... i wonder... maybe because it's very soft. i would recommend to mothers. i bought this because the bottles came with slow drip.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,I bought this gym for my daughter when she was 4 months old. It showed up the day that she got her 4 months shots. She was very fussy so I put her in the gym and she completely forgot about her discomfort. She loves to play with the toys that hang down and has the best time. There is not a day that goes by that she does not play in the gym. She even will let you know that it is time for her to play in her gym. So far this in the best toy I have found!,5
"Peg-Perego Vela Easy Drive Stroller, Geranium","DO not buy this stroller, it is horrible and a complete waste of money. After reading many reviews, it seemed to fit our needs, was bought July 2011, starting using it in April 2012. Walk 4-7 days per week on mostly even sidewalks with some tree roots. After 2 months started noticing problems...front wheels bend in awful directions, makes loud squealing noises (silicone is only a temporary fix), right foot break is broken and will not lock, right back wheel is stuck up against the break and looks like it's going to fall off, opening and closing mechanism does not always work, Snaps on the seat do not stay attached to side of carriage, back harness clip falls out often. If you plan on using this stroller a lot it will not last and problems are a safety hazard. I would not recommend this carriage at all. Have not tried to return it yet or contact Peg Perego but anticipate having to throw it in the trash.Just bought at Bob revolution SE stroller yesterday at Rei (due to lifetime satisfaction guarantee)and it's a world of difference.",1
"Skip Hop Pronto Changer Diaper Bag, Black",I love this!  My daughter is now 21 months old and we don't need to carry as many diapers with us as we used to.  It's nice when you just have to run out to the store.  Very compact and portable.  ALrge space to change baby when opened.  Pillow is nice especially for the changing tables you find out in public!,4
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Penguin",I ordered this backpack to place a couple of bottles and baby food for short trips. I like buying fun interesting items for my baby not just typical pink all over or winnie the pooh. With a small icepack its keeps items cool. Its cute and different and that why i like it!,4
"Safety 1st Deluxe Press Fit Outlet Plugs, 8-Count","I know the point is to make it hard for the little ones to reach the outlets, but once these are installed there is NO getting them off without destroying the darn thing! We had to use pliers to wrench this thing out of the outlet, and by the time it came free, it was completely destroyed. We tried multiple ones from the box and they are all the same (we had hoped that the first two were just defective). BEWARE! We almost broke the outlet trying to get these little buggers off.",1
BABYBJORN Booster Seat - White,"I got this for my 2-year-old who loves to sit at the bench at our kitchen table but needs some ""boosting"" to sit comfortably there and eat.  It's working fine, but I wish the rubber stoppers on the bottom of the seat were a little more rubbery/sticky.  We can't use the straps to attach it to a chair since we're using it on a bench.  I was hoping the rubber on the bottom would keep it from sliding around, but it doesn't really serve that purpose.  Otherwise it's a good booster seat.",4
Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,This bottle warmer was so unreliable that I ended up throwing it out and purchasing a different brand after 6 weeks.  It took forever to heat up and then would overheat the milk in an instant and boil it.  The amount of time it took was never the same from day to day.  Warming a bottle in a glass of hot water is more effective than this bottle warmer and about as time consuming.Just got a Kiinde Kozii and so far so good... no scorched milk unlike with Dr. Brown's.,1
KidCo Outlet Plug Cover,"This is definitely the cover you need.  It fits the large bulky plugs like to ones on heavy duty power strips, not just the small plugs like the ones on lamps.",5
"Safety 1st Go Hybrid Convertible Booster, Waterloo","We bought the safety first car seat, the strap is bit short, and we called the customer service to get a longer strap. After spending hours talking to customer service, and sending photos , they asked us to remove the comfort insert to get more space, and refuse to send us the longer strap. What a cheap company!",1
"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors May Vary","This product is a great idea and a great value.  I used to buy the individual formula packets that are quite pricey.  Once I bought this, I saved a ton of money.  It's easy and convenient. It's also cheap and easy to wash.  A diaper bag staple!",5
Baby Jogger BJ20257 City Select Stroller with Second Seat - Quartz,We had planned to have 2 kids relatively close together but I didn't want to push around a double stroller with only one child. I am currently half way through my 2nd pregnancy and have an 11 month old and use this stroller as a single currently but have the 2nd seat to switch to a double as soon as number 2 arrives. I wish I had bought this originally instead of having a Graco single now and this one. It is GREAT quality and was easy to put together. We absolutely love it and were hesitant to spend the money but feel it is worth it...hope it stays that way!,5
Medela Freestyle Breast Pump,"I started with a borrowed PIS Backpack model that was about four years old. After finding out my insurance company reimbursed 100%, I decided to buy 'the best pump money could buy'.I was initially excited about not having to have it plugged in and the timer function was sort of neat. The bag used to carry the pump sucked, flimsy as are most Medela bags. On that same note, the cooler zipper pull broke off after about two weeks use. For 350.00+ the bag should have been flawless and exceptionally functional.The 'hands-free' option is practically useless, no matter how many times I tried to readjust it, I still had to hold the cups in place with my own hands.After about a month of using it I noticed my milk supply start to go down to almost nothing and the only thing that had changed was the new pump. I called Medela very frustrated and wanted a refund. They couldnt give a refund since it wasnt purchased through their company directly (I bought it as Babies R Us) BUT they did send me a brand new Freestyle in the box that I was then able to return to Babies R Us (since it was sealed) and purchase a new Pump In Style with the Metro Bag.My supply has since gone back up and I am much happer with the pump in style. The bells and whistles of the freestyle was not worth the price and when it comes to ability to pump breast milk, pump in style is far superior. I do though, know a lot of moms who love their Freestyle, not every pump is for every mom!",2
,"I have triplets so we wanted something strong, heavier and durable since they are in it the majority of the day.  We have two sets and one extension for a large yard.  Easy assembly.  Just wish you could lock the joints more so it can't be pushed out of shape (although it doesn't get too out of shape).  They use it to practice standing and walking and it is great for that.  Gate easy to open with one hand.",5
"Luca and Company Little Helper FunPod, White","We love our FunPod, it's perfect for my 23 month old.  He is able to stand and help at the counter and when he isn't interested in what I'm doing he will play with his toys at the counter.  It was very easy to assemble and is compact, which is perfect for our small kitchen.  He also likes to duck down inside to play &#34;hide&#34; and sometimes just likes to sit in it to have his snack.  I looked into the Learning Tower but was concerned with the open sides, as much as my son moves around I can't imagine myself being at ease putting him in it compared to the way I feel about him being in the FunPod.I like that it comes in a variety of colors and colors that aren't eyesores in the home the way a lot of children's products can be.  We have only had it for a little over a month but I can see how it will become a big part of our everyday routine already.",5
Maxi-Cosi Foray Stroller - Choco Mint,"Got it on  Craigslist for $90..was not sure about it but I needed a walking stroller. I must say it exceeded my expectations.It is not compact and not easy to fold at first, but it's very comfy for my kids(even my almost 5 y o/ 50lb who is off the charts for height fits in it great) and pushes like a dream even on the trails. Zip on cover is great in the rain/wind.I like it very much:)",5
"Dream On Me Classic 2 in 1 Convertible Stationary Side Crib, Cherry",Love it ! Saved money with this excellent bed!,5
Baltic Amber Necklace - Four Color Free Form,I had this item for my 1st son and it's the only thing I will use for my new born when his teeth come in. I was amazed at how well it worked. I have told many friends about this item and they have bought and used it for their kids. Don't waste your money on ointments.,5
Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"Note: KidKushion makes the standard (this product) and the jumbo. The standard is thinner and about 3/4"" x 3/4"". The Jumbo is about 1.25"" x 3/4"", thicker and has a nice sculpted look. This one is fine, but I perfer the jumbo.",4
Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Activity Center,"I got this for my grandson for Christmas and all I can say is &#34;I love it&#34;!My little boy was still too small for it, but as he's grown into it, he love being there! Even before, the parts are detachable so he was playing with then long before sitting in the center.I highly recommend this to everyone!",5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink","Bought for older kids (8 and 12)--perfect, fits in lunchbox, keeps food hot until lunch (almost too hot), good size for spooning out of, washes easily, no scratches yet after a couple weeks of use, seems very durable and NO LEAKS! Great product.",5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"Came in on time and were exactly like the ones in the store. They also have extra lids, medium flow nipples, and nipple covers.",5

Playtex Sip Ease Replacement Valve - 2 Pk,Fair price compared to buying whole new sippy cups.  Product is a direct replacement and works well as a replacement,4
Munchkin Dora the Explorer Bath Squirters,"These are very cute, not top of the line, but Claire will simply love them in the tub!  They are well enough made to be completely safe, which is so important these days. No small parts to come loose. Colors are not as bright as most of these toys are, but she will love them.",4
"NEW Membranes for Medela Breastpump 8-pk Part # 87088, PIS","These membranes are certainly different that the original Medela ones, but I haven't had any trouble. They are thicker but fit into the slot just fine. I'm thankful they make them so I don't have to pay so much for the name brand!",4
"HALO SleepSack Wearable Blanket - Yellow, Micro-Fleece Size: X-Small","With SIDS to worry about, I really do sleep more soundly at night knowing that my baby is warm but not at risk of being smothered by a loose blanket.  The newborn size claims to be for babies 5-10 pounds, but the sizes are pretty generous - our baby was born 9 lbs 2 oz and 22 inches long, and the newborn size was quite roomy on her.  The bottom-to-top zipper really is convenient for diaper changes, and while the sleepsack did shrink somewhat in the wash, that really hasn't affected its fit on our baby.  My only complaints are that the fleece began to pill after a few washes (a purely aesthetic complaint) and the zipper could be of higher quality.  However, I wouldn't trade the sleepsack for a regular blanket, and I highly recommend it to all parents of infants.",5
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","This is a great car seat.  It seems really comfortable for my three year old who is 38 pounds and very tall.  The install was a little difficult in my Honda Pilot - it seems that seats are the first go around, after that it goes so much quicker - but once I got it figured out, it is rock solid.  I couldn't use the LATCH because he is over the weight limit but since there are two ways to install the seat besides LATCH I was able to get a good snug fit.There isn't a whole lot of room between the front of the carseat and the back of the driver's seat but I am tall, too, and my seat is in the furthest back position.  It isn't that there isn't any room for my son's feet, just that there is less than with his previous seat.  I think that once it is in full booster mode it will sit back a little further than it does now and there will be plenty of room for his growing legs.My son really likes having the cup holders and the place to rest his head which his last seat didn't have.  I'm really glad that there is a five-point harness available for his size/age range since he isn't old enough to just use a belt routing over one shoulder booster and I'll bet we won't have to buy another seat for him ever since it converts into that type of seat for when he is older.  This is our third Britax (for two children) and I've always felt that they were safe and comfortable carseats - much more so than any other we have used.  I am very pleased with this purchase.",5
"Carters Easy Fit Velour Plush Crib Fitted Sheet, Chocolate","My son was having such a hard time getting to sleep at night...he would love a cuddle blanket to bring into his crib, however, he is only 4 months and this seemed really unsafe. These sheets wash well and add a little warmth. We also saw on the video monitor that he was able to settle himself better as he rubbed his face over them...don't think twice. Grab these.",5
Dreamscapes Soother,"Our daughter LOVES her Dreamscape!  She's had it since she was about 3 months old...  she's now 15 months and still uses it every day for naps and bedtime.  She has used it not only to put herself to sleep but she also turns it on in the morning to let me know she's ready to get up. :) No crying... :)  I'm about to go and buy a second one this afternoon.  She has loved it to death (LITERALLY).  Like everyone one says... it definitely will suck up the batteries!  It didn't so much when she was younger and I controlled it... but now that she controls it, we are replacing batteries every 2-3 weeks...  IT'S STILL WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD!",5
Pinecone Silhouette Lodge Cabin Night Light,I love the simplicity of this night light. It casts a soft glow while adding a nice touch to our bath of loons and pine trees. I am so happy with this purchase. :),5
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","I bought this bumper because one morning when I went to get my princess out of bed her little leg was dangling through the slat on her crib, and while she wasn't bothered, I certainly was! I ordered it in chocolate brown and it arrived with several stain marks on one piece. I sent a  picture to the company, and within minutes had a reply and a promise to send a replacement at no charge. Very, very impressed. Plus the product works terrific!",5
"MAM Learn to Drink Training Cup, 8 Months, 9 Ounce, Colors May Vary",They were supposed to be leak proof and they leaked. One came with missing parts and was the wrong color. Amazon fixed the problem immediately.,2
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"My 3-mos old twins just love this product! It's cozy and soft and the vibration is very gentle. I should have bought two of them but for now they take turns sleeping in it. It folds up easily and can get tucked away it he nursery when we're not using it. I highly recommend this purchase! It's also attractive and elegant looking, not garish and bold.",5
"Carter's Butterfly Flowers Rug, Pink/Choc, 30 X 40&quot;","I ordered the 13pc Geeny crib bedding set, which is pink & brown flowers & butterflies, & wanted a rug to match. Came across this rug & was hoping it matched the set, & it did! It's a very cute rug, the colors are pretty & it's the perfect size to lay beside the crib. I am very pleased.",5
Child to Cherish Marshmallow Clay Handprint Ornament,It's a little tricky to roll out. The indent isn't really profound enough to see from a distance so I painted mine. You don't have to bake it like some of the other handprint products and it isn't as messy as ink. I'd say it worked out pretty well for me.,4
"Evenflo SmartSteps Jump and Go, ABC123","We really love this jumper!  My daughter initially just played with the toys, but now she jumps like crazy in it!  It's great bc she laughs and gets exercise (it makes for a nice nap later!) and I can get some of my stuff done. She is above avg in height and avg weight, there is plenty of room for her to grow with this.",5
"Burp Cloth Set, 2 pack, Girl &quot;I Love Daddy&quot; (Pink), Frenchie Mini Couture",Bought for my niece and they do the job!!!! Glad I got at such a good deal! Will buy more!!!,5
"Snoozy Organic  2 PACK Flannel Cotton Anti Allergy Waterproof Multi Use Pad, 18&quot; x 27&quot;","Try to leave your judgments aside, but we're co-sleeping in-bed with our new baby.  We started with one package of Snoozies, and ordered two more packages.  Although we have a water-resistent mattress pad, the Snoozy prevents having to change our sheets in the middle of the night when we have diaper blowouts or leaks.  We probably change the Snoozy once or twice a day.  The fabric pills a little, but is nice and soft.  I love that it's organic since baby is sleeping on it for hours (with any luck) at a time.  I added Snoozy to my registry on a whim, and now it's one of our top-5 essential baby items.",5
"Rain or Shine Kids Woobee Plush Blanket, Turquoise/Chocolate","This blanket is great. It is pretty much permanently tied to his car seat-- when he is dozing off, I flip it over.. when it is raining out I flip it over to keep him dry on way from car to house...you can also untie it and use it to sit on in the park. It's a great blanket.",5
Trendsport Lite Stroller,"Yes, there are some faults with the stroller, but based on the price, it is still probably the best bang for the buck.  We got this stroller because I needed something that I can carry up and down the stairs while I am on the subway.  Most people in NYC are helpful, but every once in a while, I have to do it myself.  I would not know how I would do it without my Trendsport.My husband bought the Graco MetroLite, which was 18 lbs, so I complained that I needed something lighter.  The Trendsport was perfect, since we did not have to shell out a lot of money.  Sure, there are some problems trying to steer it, and there are only 2 seat-positions, but these are very minor drawbacks.  It is still a great stroller and definitely a great bargain.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",Great chair! My son loves this chair! I love how you can use it as a rocker for more than a few months. It can grow with him.,5
"Lamaze Cloth Book, Panda's Pals","I have nicknamed my nephew &#34;Destructor&#34; for his incredible ability to destroy anything he touches. He is very active except when he is being read to, his favorite books.....peek a boo. This one is great! Its soft which he has loved as a child, and keeps him from hurting himself accidentally (some of the peek a boo hard books do have hard edges and worry me a bit). The animals and the activity of it is wonderful!",4
Fisher-Price SpaceSaver Bounce 'n Spin Froggy,"My son is not yet 6 months old in this video.  He still likes being in the exersaucer but not for more than 10 minutes, so it gives me time to do a couple small tasks but not a lot.  The most benefit so far has been when his feet reached the floor more solidly and he could move it around 180 degrees, bounce and play with the toys more intently.For the money I think it's a great toy.  Please remember to read the instructions/ recommendations.  You shouldn't have a child in one of these for more than 20 minutes at a time because their hips are still developing, also keep an eye on the color of their legs; the fabric could cut off circulation if they shift the wrong way, especially when their legs are short.",5
Prince Lionheart Ever Fresh Pillowcase,If you have the wiper warmer you must get this. If you do not you will end up with a orange crusty film on the bottom of the warmer and on the underside of the pad.,5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,This is what you buy for the baby who has everything.  My cousin recommended them to me..........says she buys them for every baby shower she goes to. :),5
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black",It fits on the B-Agile stroller perfectly and doesn't get in the way when you fold the stroller up! The cup holders are great - having 2 comes in sooo handy. I love the extra storage pockets too.,5
Princess Toddler Bed,"I love this bed. We looked at several beds, and we decided on this one because every KidCraft product we have purchased has been easy to put together. This was no expection - It was very easy to put together. Everything lined up and fit perfect. It is great quality and absolutely adorable! The only reason I did not give it four stars is because the crowns on the bed posts that was delivered are very different than what is pictured. I did not like them at first mostly because they were different than what I was expecting. I must admit they have grown on me. This is a great little first bed. My daughter loves the princess theme, and she looks forward to sleeping in her princess big girl bed. It made the transition out of her crib a breeze! A great purchase!",4
"Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green",This countertop drying rack is not big enough to hold much at all and certainly does not replace the traditional drying rack. Looks much bigger in the picture.,2
"Carters Easy Fit Jersey Cradle Fitted Sheet, Blue","Expecting my first grand baby in a month and needed to get our cradle ready  (which was the cradle my own two children used...awww)  Wasn't sure to begin with if I could find sheets for an older cradle since everything has been restyled and improved upon since they were born 28 years ago.  Found these sheets and they are perfect.  They fit very well, and the fabric will be very comfy for the little one.  I have pre washed them and they still look great!  I purchase 2 of these sage green sheets (which is a the perfect shade I was looking for) and also a white one.",5
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Diaper Pail, White","I bought this after my Diaper Genie II Elite BROKE! I loved how easy it was to dispose of a diaper in the Diaper Genie II Elite however it wasn't so easy to change out the liners. It also smelled bad and the liners were very expensive!I gave the Arm and Hammer diaper pail by Munchkin 4 stars because isn't hands-free like the Diaper Genie II Elite and the less I have to touch a diaper, the better. But the Arm and Hammer diaper pail is incredibly easy to change liners, it holds in the stink much better, it's less complicated, and the liners cost less. I'm very happy I took a chance and got this pail!",4
"Badger Basket Moses Basket, Pink Gingham",I was scared to let my baby sleep in the basket at night b/c I was scared he would get pushed up against the sides. Good for napping though. Can't beat the price.,2
"Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Navy/Red",My son loves playing &#34;52 pick-up&#34; with us and his toys! This solved the problem. We've had about a month and haven't had any issues.,5
"Dappi Waterproof 100% Vinyl Diaper Pants, 3Pack, White, Newborn","They don't work. Urine goes right through them! Don't waste your money, buy more panties and don't give up! :)",1
Pognae 3 in 1 Hipseat Carrier (denim),"I bought this when my son is 7 mo. He was over 9.5 kg (21lbs) already. Pognae 3-in-1 hipseat carrier is quite popular in east Asia but not in USA yet. I've owned boba warp, maya wrap, beco gemini before getting this one. This is more like beco gemini that you can put baby facing forward. The problem with gemini is that baby's bottom is pressed in the carrier pocket and my son feels uncomfortable most of the time and resists to be in it. The hipseat carrier ensures there is enough space for the bottom and my son can maintain the sitting position very well and enjoys the view. Also the mesh lining makes it not so hot for the baby. If this product had had been on the market earlier I would have got it instead of the beco gemini.I feel very secured with the hipseat part. There is a wide and long velcro patch at the waist belt beside the big main buckle. Also there is a small mesh pocket at the side of the hipseat belt that you can place your cell phone or key chains there. Nice design! There are buckles on each end of the shoulder belts, the upper one is rounded and free to rotate. I found it very nice that it's free to adjust the angle of the shoulder belt. The downside of it is that sometimes I was worried if the buckles were strong enough to hold the weight. The hipseat is bulky, but all hipseats are bulky so it's okay.I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the zip connecting the hipseat and the carrier. I need to make sure it's all the way zipped down every time when I put it on. Sometimes it gets a bit open especially when I take it off and this is dangerous. Although there are 2 extra velcro belt to secure the connection but the belts are so small (1cmx2cm approximately) that I doubt if they can really hold the weight when the zipper is open. It will be better if the secure velcro straps are wider and longer. Also it will be nice to have a small hook at the zipper end like women's dress to make sure the zipper doesn't open on its own.In general I highly recommend this product.",4
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","This walker is the shiznite. My son loves this thing! I don't care about the colors and all that jazz. I mean, it isn't like my son looked at it and was like - that red looks pink, I ain't getting into this thing....anyway, the bumper is awesome, and keeps him from smashing his little hands on everything. The activity center is like the love of his life. It has so many sounds/effects that it is hard to keep up with. Since you can remove it and use the tray, he can play with other toys on it as well.The grips make it hard for him to go from our hardwood floors to carpet, so it stops him in his tracks.Although you must monitor him in it for every moment, it has really brought this boy a sense of independence. He chases us, walks to us, follows us, it is pretty sweet.What an awesome product.",5
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","The panels helped to expand the pen for my puppies to help monitor them while outside.  It's easy to set up, move and store!",5
Fisher Price AutoMirror,"I love this mirror and I am so glad we received it as a gift!  It was easy to attach to the back seat of our SUV (we drive a Jeep Grand Cherokee) and it calms my mind as I drive.  I can see everything my daughter is doing, and I don't need to turn around to check on her.  The only added product I would recommend with this would be a mini-rearview mirror to attach under your current one, so one could be focused on the road behind you and one could be focused on the mirror to see the baby.  Otherwise, you need to adjust your rearview mirror to see both the road and the baby, which is a bit of a pain.  But, we love this mirror and would highly recommend it!",5

Bright Starts Fun on Safari Portable Swing,"What do i say? Looks good. A back saver especially if you have a clingy baby like i do... Guess it was a phase as he now spends more time on his own. The fabric comes out easy for washing. Now he is getting bigger, the swing hardly moves on the highest setting. I wouldn't hold it against the swing, lol... he is a big baby though the makers might need to adjust their projection of maximum weight to include maximum weight for swing to work effectively and not just to sit! (i wish! lol). Now,, we have to push it with our hands to make it move. I don't see this lasting beyond his 6th month birthday...My take... not a swing for big babies...",3

Levana Lila Digital Baby Video Monitor with Night Vision and Talk to Baby Intercom 32000 (White),"Truly a useless device.  I'll start with the good.  The battery life is excellent.  BUT - the conception and signal strength are abysmal.  I have a Summer video monitor and it is far superior.  I wanted to buy a 2nd summer monitor but was told (by Summer) that they would interfere with one another).So I bought this thing.  It literally can not keep a signal farther then 25 ft.  what makes it worse, every time the device loses a signal to the camera - which happens every minute - the screen turns on that is all white with a big X to prove how terrible it is.  The ambient microphone is 'too good' - which means I hear the hum of my sons humidifier and white noise.Save yourself the trouble - get the summer device.",1
"Kaloo Doudou Bear, Beige",Super soft and super cute - a great gift.  My son had a collection of these he loved them so much and the best part is that you can wash them and if you need to replace them!,4

"Boon Frog Pod Bath Toy Scoop,Green","i love it. my son loves. and i can't believe how easy it was to mount with the suction cups. we admittedly don't load it with very much- just a few boon toys and some scrubbies- but it works like a charm and isn't going anywhere.if you do choose to use the suction cup option, make sure you clean the surface area the same as you would to prepare for adhesive strip mounting.couldn't say enough good things about boon, their products, and their costumer service. we are definitely a boon family.",5
"C.R. Gibson First Year Calendar, Alex",I received a similar calendar for my first son which I used so much and loved the idea of being able to note milestones on a daily basis.  This calendar is similar however it doesn't lay flat and has come apart.  With the first calendar I put it on my son's wall and could add notes as I pleased.  This calendar needs a spiral binder to make it more user friendly,2
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,I love this!  I bought it after owning the baby bond which really wasn't as discreet as I wanted in very crowded settings i.e. restaurants. This works very well and you can see your baby which is great.  Although if you're at a restaurant and the waiter is standing over you they can also see your baby along with other things.  It looses a star for me because the material is not very breathable and baby and I both get hot using it at times in Cali weather.,4
The First Years 100 Count Pacifier Wipes,"The thing I like best about these wipes is that they are safe to go in babies mouth so I can clean baby items without the worry of what kind of chemicals baby might be ingesting. I originally bought them to use on breast pump parts since they are so much more economical that the ones sold specifically for this purpose. They did a great job of removing milk and keeping things clean while on the go. Now that I am finished breast feeding they are a diaper bag staple for cleaning pacis, teethers, and anything else baby might put in her mouth.",5
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado","This was one of my wisest purchases as a new mom who is cloth diapering!  In fact, I liked it so much, I bought two.I bought a cheap, tall trash can from Target and I put these diaper pail liners in there.  Then, I put all of my wet, dirty cloth diapers in.I have NEVER had a leak.  These liners are a good size and very strong.If you cloth diaper, search no further for a diaper pail liner!",5
Safety 1St Comfy Cushy 3-in-1 Potty,"I bought this potty to replace theSafety 1st Potty 'n Step Stoolthat we used to have. It was a great potty but my two year old cracked the seat, from using it as a step to reach the sink, and we had to toss it. While I like that it is very cushy, that same cushy bit is the part that sticks to her bottom sometimes, when she stands up, if it is stuck to her then when it falls off her bottom into the potty it is not fun. Other than that it's great. The lid is the step stool in this case and it's just about the right height for her to reach the sink.The only flaws are that the bowl is rather large, and my sink is small, if you have a tub or a bigger sink, it should be fine. Also we have the extended bowl toilets and this potty seat doesn't work so well with it. How I miss the round toilets from the old house...I also have three other potties for my daughter, one of which, the The First Years - Pooh 3-in-1 Flush & Sounds Potty, we really don't like. The cup is inset into the seat and when it sticks (and it does, a lot) the ensuing mess is very gross.",4
"Planet Wise Roll Down Wet Diaper Bag, Patchwork Plaid, Large",Great bag to hold all your wet gear. I use it for my workout clothes and towels. The large holds a lot and it does keep everything sealed in when you have to leave the bag in your car or in your laundry basket for several hours.,5
Safety 1st 2 Pack Custom Fit All Purpose Strap,"Sorry for waisting consumers'  time, but I feel the need to say this publicly -I put this on my wish list, and the price was raised OVER 140% on me the next day. I will not be purchasing this item.It's LOUSY sales technique, and it's lousy of Amazon to permit it.",1
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,"I have fallen in love with this product. I have a two week old and already have 200+ ounces in e freezer. It is a little bulky but those first few weeks you're just at home anyways. I don't have a problem with the price, only because of the amount I've been able to save in such a short amount of time. I would highly recommend this to nursing moms.",5
"MAM BPA Free 5 oz Bottle for Boy, 3-Pack ((Patterns and motifs may vary)","We were just within two weeks of me returning back to work and needed a bottle my breastfed baby girl would take. We had gone through numerouse trials with several other bottles and she refused them all. We read some reviews on the MAM Anti-Colic bottle and decided we should give it a try. The nipple on this bottle is just like the MAM pacifier we purchased. She was able to latch on to a familiar nipple without all the fussiness that normally accompanied bottle feeding. We were so relieved to know that I could return to work and not worry about how bottle feedings would go at the babysitters. Her bottle feedings are now trauma and drama free! If you are having trouble with getting your breastfed little one to bottle feed, this may be the bottle for you. It worked wonders for us!!!",5
NoJo Reversible Water-Resistant High Chair Cover Pad,"I ordered this NOJO highchair cover to go over my 5 year old Graco highchair. It fits its perfectly. The strapes line up where they belong and it is padded nicely.  I love the reversible pattern, stripes on one side, polka dots on the other.  It makes my old high chair look brand new.  I highly recommend it!",5
"Summer Infant 2 Pack Microfleece Swaddleme, Blue",These are great for keeping baby's limbs from flailing about and waking her up. I used these as soon as we got home from the hospital and they worked well. My baby is almost 1 month now and about 8 lbs. She is now able to take out her arm.,4
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet, Celery","This fitted sheet (Celery color) fits the mattress and matches the color scheme of the Graco Pack 'n Play On the Go Travel Playard, Go Green. The sheet is very soft but seems a bit thin. Although it fits the Graco Pack n Play, it isn't an absolute perfect fit, but you can't really complain considering the price.",4
"Cloud b Tranquil Turtle Night Light, Ocean","Wish it had a better motion mechanism.  I've had several and thew break after about 2-4 months.  You know, just when the warranty is up.  But my son adores it and goes to sleep with the light and sound every night.",3
"Motorola Additional Camera for Motorola MBP36 Baby Monitor, Brown with White","We have two children&#8230;an infant and a toddler that are a year apart.  So, the two cameras are in separate rooms.  This is the second baby monitoring system I have owned&#8230;if it wasn't so darn expensive for the monitor, camera, and extra camera, I would definitely replace it. But, we are just going to have to live with it.  Here's why I don't like it:1. The second camera is terrible.  It's just a blur on the monitor during the night. (Fine during the day)2. If you have a sound machine in your baby's room, you hear it on the monitor as well. (Not the case with my Tommie Tippie, or whatever it was)3. Battery dies very quickly, even when fully charged4. Very low range; I can't bring the monitor out into the kitchen and have it pick up my daughter's room (our house is 2400 sq ft ranch)",1
"Thermos FUNtainer Bottle, Disney Princess, 12 Ounce","We love these water bottles in our house! They keep liquids cold for hours without refrigeration. My youngest (18 months) now insists on using them just like her big sister. They do spill if over turned but otherwise do not leak, which is a plus in my book!",5
Infantino Bop and Pop Animal Pals Development Toy,My 2 year old and 11 month old love this toy. It is a nice toy for the price. One of them is a little hard to close but the girls can still close it.,4
"Kids Preferred Label Loveys Blanket, Little Diva","My 7 month old granddaughter loves tags, so I bought this as a Christmas gift. She loved it! She went from tag to tag and chewed them all. It's a safe blanket that she can take anywhere. It's not very big and can't be used as a warming blanket, but it's so portable and interesting that I highly recommend it for infants.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","So far, So good. Its the booster seat at grandma's house and we haven't used it much. But it fits on the chair snugly and securely. Its a great height and will be used as a regular booster without the tray when he gets older. Small and compact and portable.",5
"Stork Craft Hollie Changing Table, Espresso","We've had this changing table for nearly two years now and it isn't bowing, nothing has cracked. It's in great shape, I am pleased!",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"Overall, this video monitor is great! It's easy to use and works well for us. The picture is pretty clear and the night vision works great.The only downfall is that it totally takes down my 2.4 GHz wireless internet. Luckily, most of my devices support 5 GHz. But for the devices that only work on the 2.4 GHz frequency, they're down while the monitor is on.",4
Levana Sophia 2.4&quot; Digital Video Baby Monitor,"Overall, this was a pretty good monitor. The resolution and framerate (~25 fps) is excellent for practical usage, but isn't as good as, say, a video camera; it looks like a strong sharpening algorithm has been applied to the image, which helps with visibility on the small screen. The same goes for the sound quality (which is at least as good as a cell phone). The camera has infrared technology, so the video is just as good in both dark and light conditions, and the signal range is also pretty good - up to about 90 feet (although the framerate drops to around 10 fps at that distance).I also like the back-and-forth talking capability - the parent can press a button, and speak to the baby through the handset. I have to wonder what the baby thinks of that, though... ""Daddy shrunk and is sitting on the table!"" The camera even looks like a dude wearing a headset; you can't tell from the pictures, but there's a little microphone extending to the place where the mouth would be.The camera itself needs to be plugged in, but the handset is chargeable, so you can unplug it and carry it around with you. The power supplies for both the camera and the handset are the same and are interchangeable (they have the same input/output and connectors). They don't look exactly the same, though; the wall plugs look different, and one of them has a picture of a handset on it. I can only assume that it was meant to be used for the handset, although it also works for the camera.  It would have been nice if a micro-USB charger worked with either, especially the for recharging the handset.The instructions are mostly in pictures and don't use very much text to explain usage, and the handset interface is designed without any text, so the monitor is great for people who don't understand English. It can be a little confusing at times (I had some trouble figuring out how the settings worked), but basic usage is very quick and simple.The camera part of the monitor can be rotated to point upwards or downwards, but it's a bit limited; it cannot point very far up or down. It can be mounted on the wall, but due to the small range of movement, it will probably end up pointing towards the floor. Tabletop usage is fine, however.Being able to see the temperature in baby's room is a very nice touch, and will be particularly reassuring during very cold or hot weather.  Obviously this would also be very useful in monitoring pets in the garage or in an enclosed patio etc.I would recommend this monitor to a parent who wants an easy, safe way to keep an eye on his or her baby.",5
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory","LOVE this pillow! It has saved me from many sleepless nights. It's super comfortable.  I just went on vacation and really regretted not taking it with me.  I sleep more throughout the nights now, besides the middle of the night trip to the bathroom of course! :)",5
Damask Fuchsia 3 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set by Bananafish,"Before buying the bedding I looked at it on several sites. Not one photo was the same. I saw hot pink, fuchsia, coral pink, and bubble gum pink. I liked the design enough I took a chance. I think the bedding is adorable but the color is hard to match with d&eacute;cor. One thing I would like to see change is the green. You really don't notice the edging on the quilt. It needs to be more vibrant. One last thing, when washing the quilt, it may turn the white damask a light shade of pink/peachish color. I was pretty annoyed by this BUT I have to remember it will be peed on. I shouldn't care too much.",3
"Cocalo Christmas Stocking and Rattle Set, Reindeer",This is a very nice stocking for our new grand baby. It comes with a detached reindeer rattle and the size is perfect for a newborn baby. Shipped in just a few days and arrived in tact with no defects. 100% satisfied.,5
"The First Years Deluxe Reclining Feeding Seat, Dots","Very happpy with the product and its performance. Light weight, very portable, easy to clean. I love that it can tilt back or sit straight up with ease. Only con about it is the tray is not very easy to lock into place, which can be a challenge when struggling with a six month old who is fighting you for his food.",4
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"When my first child was born, I thought I didn't need a video monitor...until he started rolling around in his bed, and eventually climbing out.  Now he's 2 and I just purchased this to keep an eye on him as he gets out of bed on his own now, and for our new baby that's on the way.  Can't believe I didn't get one of these sooner!  Picture is clear in both dark and lighted room, sound quality is just as good if not better than any other monitor I've owned.  I love this monitor.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",We toyed with the idea of getting one of those fancy booster seats but eventually settled on this one due to the amazing reviews. We are VERY glad we did! Well made + lightweight + easy to clean + adjustable = seriously great product! The only complaint I have is that the straps stain relatively easily. The rest of it held up for two years and was still in amazing shape when we sold it to a consignment store. WORTH EVERY PENNY!,5
Born Free ComfortFit Body Pillow,"Being 5 months pregnant I am starting to need a little bit support while sleeping and this Body pillow really helps. I wish I had it when I was pregnant with my first. The pillow wraps around my neck so I can use it as a pillow for my head and then it curls around my belly and wraps around my legs for support between my legs as well. I only wish it was a little thicker in the area by my belly but other than that I really like this pillow. And when I am not using it, I can coil it up into a ball shape and put it away.My son, who is about to turn 2, really likes this body pillow as well. He likes to have it wrapped around his body and sitting in the middle of it. Or wrap it around him and bump into things. He uses it more for play, sometimes he likes to wrangle it like a snake. So it has many uses, and when my baby is born I can use this as a nursing pillow as well.",4
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"To bulky, not what I expected or needed. Needless to say I gave it to a family member that could use it in a different area. Would not buy again.",2
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",Great seat. Easy to use / clean / adjust. Easily fits on the seat so the tray slides under a dining room table.,5
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black",I am not very satisfied with this item bacause the sun still gets in my baby's eyes. I will have to find some other type of sun shade to stop the sun from getting in my baby's eyes.,3
"Philips AVENT Soothie Pacifier, 0-3 Months, 2-Pack, Pink/Purple",These are the only pacifiers my kids use! I love that their BPA free. Great to use if you're breast feeding.,4
"Bright Starts Bouncer, Playful Pals","I purchased it for a baby shower and the mom loved it. It was the only one that she received,",5
See Me Smile Infant Mirror Tan Bear,"This doubles very effectively as a car distraction/toy and a way to see what's going on in the back. Now that my little one is almost two, she usually pulls it down, but I don't need to see back as much now that she's older anyway. She likes to give the bear hugs. **This will only work in cars where there's an elevated head rest that the bean bag attached on the back can sit against.",5
"ReUsies 2 Pack Snack and Sandwich Reusable Bags, Camo","I did my research before buying reusable sandwich and lunch bags.  I am glad I chose reUsies.  My two children love their bags and insist on showing all their friends at school.  I have had this product one week and already have another mom asking me about them.  Also, for the reviewer asking about the extra velcro....that is to double fold the bag to make it have a tighter seal.  What a great idea!",5
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White","I bought this to go along with my 3"" portable pack and play mattress, and I am very happy and satisfied with it. Not sure what else to say, if you need a mattress pad for your portable mattress, just get this one.",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,I was not able to fit nearly as much as people claimed in this net. Also it made huge holes in my walls.,2
"Turtlemeter, the Baby Bath Floating Turtle Toy and Bath Tub Thermometer",Very good product (for now). It shows you the temp very fast and clear. I used different company before and it didn't last for too long so I'm really hoping this one will last a bit longer...,5
"Bedtime Originals Jungle Buddies Wallpaper Border, Brown/Yellow","I thought it was more like a sticker, something easier to put on the wall. It has to be put in water then placed on wall, and a couple other steps that could be a bit annoying. I like the design tho reason why I bought it",4
Evenflo Aura Select Travel System - Caroline,"Great travel system, very girly! My only complaint is that it isn't freestanding when folded, and it's pretty heavy and kind of awkward when lifting it into a vehicle. Also, amazon shows that other customers buy an extra base that is taupe colored. While it works just fine, if you want it to match, you need the silver one.",4
"Graco DuoDiner LX Highchair, Metropolis",This high chair just has the perfect size and weight. easy to clean and robust.My son who is 30 months old just love it.,4
"Britax Pinnacle 90 Booster Car Seat, Broadway","I'm a small, not very strong grammy of seven grandchildren, ranging in age from three months to almost seven. (Safety first, of course, and you can't beat Britax). I drive a Subaru Forester, which means swapping car seats in and out to accommodate the different ages and sizes.  Which has always meant finding a man to wrestle the car seats in place and secure them. If there is a woman out there strong enough to safely secure a car seat, I have yet to meet her.This car seat is incredible. I can secure it by myself - my sons are big men and they can't make it budge after I have installed it. I can easily and quickly adjust it to fit a two-and-a-half year old, four-and-a-half year old (harness) and an almost seven year old (booster). The kids are comfortable, even after hours of driving, the side wings keep their heads from flopping so badly when they sleep. I have trouble with written instructions and diagrams, but this manual is pretty easy to understand and Britax has very helpful uTube videos.This car seat is expensive, but absolutely worth it if you have to transfer car seats from one vehicle to another or adjust them to fit kids of different sizes very often. The engineering is amazing, using it makes you proud to belong to a species that thunk it up. It is very heavy, though, don't even think about carrying it any distance.",5
ULTRASCALE MBSC-55 Digital Baby Pet Scale,"We bought this scale to measure breastmilk after feedings as well and were deceived by the specs. It seemed at first glance to measure to 0.1 oz and 0.001 kg which means it would measure to 1 gram. However, we figured out that it is a postal scale and that is why it rounds to the 0.5 ounce after 2 lbs. (It also rounds to 10 grams.) This means that if you are trying to measure breastmilk, it would round to 0.5 ounces and would defeat the purpose. There is a way around this. If you are looking to measure breast milk, measure in grams. You can get accuracy to +/- 10 mL b/c it rounds to 10 grams at either end. If the start weight is 3000, it could be 2995 or 3005. If the end weight is 3100, it could be 3095 or 3105. So the increase is 90-110, so +/-10. If your baby needs to eat 100 mL, then his/her weight should go up about 100 grams after feeding. (+/- 10) (Denisity of water is about the same as breastmilk so 1 g = 1 mL.) Measuring this way is the best you can do with scales out there (I checked everyone available) unless you have 100's of dollars to spend.",3
Britax B-Nimble Mosquito Net,"It fits nicely on my maclaren techno xt stroller.  The cup holder is simple and not as bulky as others(munchkin and valcobaby).  It fits on SQURE tubing, not round tubing.  It will work for all maclaren models volo, triumph, quest, and techno XT.  Not sure about maclaren XLR.  If maclaren XLR has the same rear tubing as other maclarens, then this cup holder will fit.  I loved it!  It is a godsend considering there are few choices out there for maclaren strollers, which do not have any cupholders.",5
"Neat Solutions Applique Print Coral Fleece Bath Robe, Owl",I absolutely love this bath robe.  It is extremely soft and my daughter loves to be wrapped in it after her baths. I would highly recommend this product.,5
"Contours Lite Stroller, Tangerine","I love this stroller! My son was 5 1/2 months when we purchased this stroller (he is now almost 7 1/2) and we have loved it from day one. It was super easy to take out of the box and put together. We have taken this everywhere with us! Its been tossed in the back of a truck and left in the rain(oops), gone on packed dirt trails with ease, daily walks, and through several gate checks with the airlines and through TSA.I read a ton of the reviews here on Amazon so I knew from purchase there was some things I would change upon arrival. I have a JJ Cole car seat/stroller cushion that I popped in there(had it from when he was an infant for his old car seat and stroller) just to make it more comfortable for him. On the days it is being washed I see no difference in his comfort level, but it definitely helped keep him in place when he was smaller. I knew to take the cup holder off before putting it in the trunk so it didn't get lost. It is not a permanent attachment, it's optional so yes it can pop off. We have no issue with the handles not being adjustable. I am 5'7, my husband is 6'1 and we both use it with ease.Pros:Easy to maneuver even one handedLightweight but sturdyLarge storage basketCanopy covers a large area of childHandles are cushionedEasy fold and secureFits in both our crossover suv and mazda 3 with roomComfort cushion strap covers - my son loves to drool and teeth on theseEasy to connect toys toFast to adjust strapsMy escape artist son has not figured out how to get out of it!! (we've purchased and returned 3 car seats)5 point harnessSnack tray - not many lightweight strollers have one and I didn't want to spend more $$$ just to add something that should be thereAccepted at airline gate check - big thing for me as I fly A LOT! I use the  JL Childress Gate Check bagCons (not many!!)Two hand fold - had Baby Trend with one hand fold before and this is actually easier to fold than one hand but annoying when I have arms full of things.Hard to get to storage basket in recline position- seems that way for every stroller thoughCanopy feels flimsy - haven't broken it yet and we are NOT gentle plus my son is now big enough to attack itRecline is strap adjust - I've never had anything else so I don't know any different but it can be a little annoying when little man is asleep and I try to adjust.I love this stroller and I am very glad I have purchased it. I wanted something lightweight, with a snack tray, large storage basket, and with minimal bells and whistles. This fit the bill and is extremely affordable. Plus orange is my favorite color.",5

"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","With my first child I thought the Diaper Genie was a must have even though the refill liners seemed expensive. After about 9 months of using the Genie I noticed a horrible odor eminating throughout my home. It seemed the Diaper Genie took on the smell of all those dirty diapers. I tried cleaning the unit, but the rotting, putrid smell was pretty much baked into the plastic. With my second child I tie poopy diapers up in a plastic grocery bag and toss them in the trash can in my garage and they all go out on trash day. So much better! Well that was my experience. I can't recommend the Diaper Genie because to me it just seems like a gimmick.",1
Sassy Flutterby Teether Developmental Toy,"Was excited by how the Flutterby held my 2-3 week old's attention. But the plastic water wings are flimsy and cracked before he even started teething, seriously doubt it would have held up to teething once teeth came through.",1
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,I got one of these because I was over producing milk. They collect a good amount of milk and it's nice because I don't feel like I am wasting the letdown. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because these things are HUGE! the pictures make them look like they are small and discrete but they are not. I had originally hoped to wear them around the house while I waited for my milk to stabilize but they are so big there is no way you could wear them around.I also wash it after every use. so I have a tendency to forget to put them in when I am nursing and really only use it when I have to use my hand pump to let off some pressure from the over supply.I would suggest these to people but I don't think they are the best product on the market.,4
Diaper Dude Eco Bottle Holder - Green,"I bought this bottle cooler for my &#34;tactical diaper bag&#34;. (It's a dad thing...) It seems to insulate well and be constructed fairly durably. I haven't had the product for enough time to comment on longevity though. I would have given five stars if it was slightly larger in diameter. As it is, I have to force our Tommee Tippee bottles into the cooler, and I worry that I am going to tear the lining eventually. If the bottle holder was 1/4&#34; larger, there wouldn't be a problem. Tommee Tippee bottles are a major brand, and I expected that the designers would have planned/tested for those bottles, especially since this is slightly more expensive than similar products. The holder is tall enough for Dr. Brown's bottles, if you use that brand.",4
iiamo Warm Heating Cartridge - 5 pack,When they work it's great. But the problem is that I got a shipment where 3 of the cartridges didn't work. FAIL!!,2
The First Years Newborn to Toddler Reclining Feeding Seat,"Works just fine for babies, but I can't get it to raise up to get my toddler to the table. You push it in and with simple hand pressure, it falls sloping forward. I guess I could put a book in it, but I'm not going to do that.But it worked great for the baby and if I wanted to continue to use it with the tray, it would continue to work great. Easy to pull apart to clean. We stopped using the silly cover about a year ago and just wipe it down between uses. The seat comes out to clean as well. No problems putting it together.but I cannot figure out how to raise the seat properly to use it at the table.",3
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This is a great product.Pros:My son seems to love it. He enjoys the swinging motion and is very comfortable in the papisan.Cons:It seems to be a little pricey.The mirror and moving animals are out of the childs sight.The lowest speed on the swing is a little bit to fast.Overall a nice swing. I would recommend this to anyone, but you might be able to find something else suitable for less money.",4
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty","This seat couldn't have any better features...I feel it would survive a plane crash its so well made.  Unfortunately, that little base that is ATTACHED makes itA) sit really highB) hit my baby's head on ceiling, trying to get him in.C) hard to see around it.My kid is 10 mos. old and I drive a nissan pathfinder, maybe if my seats sat lower it would be fine. I will have to return it :(",4
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Print Boy, Large",I bought this in blue for my daughter. She is not 6 month old yet so I can't talk about the fit but the color and the design are lovely. It does wash and dry well. I did not take any special precaution and it came out perfect.,5
Safety 1st Easy Saver Diaper Pail,I cannot keep this in my room with spoiled diapers in it because it stinks. This product is completely a waste and I don't know how they designed it. The use of a diaper pail is that it should control the smell of spoiled diapers.,1
Prince Lionheart Diaper Depot Clear,"We are currently using a pop up and play packyard with a sleeper/changer in it for infants. This packyard grows with baby but does not have a place to store diapers, wipes, etc. This clips onto the packyard on the front and is so convenient for the storage of the supplies we need handy! Love this product!",5
"JJ Cole Collections Stroller Attachment, Graphite",I'm a new mom and wasn't sure what to look for in something as seemingly simple as a hook to carry the diaper bag. This is the perfect thing. They are strong - feels like they could hold the heaviest bag. They were easy to get on the stroller and move around to fit my bag's hooks. This is a definite must for any new mom or dad.,5
"Leachco Snoogle Mini Compact Side Sleeper, Sage/White dot","It has replaced me in bed leaving me no room to cuddle, I have to work around her favorite new pillow :/ GREAT for pregnancy, holds its form very well, easily cleaned.

Levana Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery and Talk to Baby Intercom,"I use this monitor for my disabled boy who has epilepsy. I love that it so portable, it has a clip to attach to your clothes or reverse the clip and it becomes a stand to put on any table. My favorite features are theroom temperature display on screen, if my boy gets to hot he has seizures, and the intercom feature so i can talk back and forth with him if he has one of his frequent nightmares. The picture is much clearer in night vision mode than other monitors I've used in the past that the picture was so grainy, a definite plus! The only feature i didn't like although a great idea was the lullaby songs, when used it cuts the sound from the room in and out. I love this monitor and would definitely purchase it again in the future!",5
"Carters Keep Me Dry Water Resistant Flannel Crib Pad, White","I like these pads the best for lining my changing pads (I cut this crib-sized one into thirds to do this).  While yes it is all cotton, I have not had issues with anything leaking through, and my kids have peed and drooled directly on it many times.",5
Lamaze Puppytunes,"cute idea, only four notes, so ""tunes"" are very limited. Children have a hard time getting the toy to play notes because to get sound to come out you have to squeeze pretty hard, quickly, which is impossible for a small child. Save your money and buy something else.",2
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","My kids love this whale and it's great knowing if they fall this will protect them from the faucet. The only problem is that my faucet has a front plug for the shower, not a top plug.",4
"NUK BPA Free Pacifier Carry Case, Colors May Vary","This case is very convenient and durable. The only issue i had with it is that soothies will not fit into it. It only works with the regular shaped pacifiers like MAM and NUK, etc. That being said, once my son decided he didn't like the soothies anymore and switched to the MAM pacis, it works perfectly.",4
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack, Lavender or Citrus","Arrived on time, very well packaged, and super cute but the fragrance was very light if you could even smell it at all.",3
Summer Infant Bibbity - Pink (2-Pack),"These are much better than cloth bibs.  However, my little one loves to chew on them (he is teething).  This gets a little messy.",4
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,I'm a lactation consultant and I needed something soft to spoon feed special needs newborns breast milk.  These fit the bill perfectly.,5
"NUK Peter Rabbit Dinnerware Plate, BPA-Free, Nickelodeon Nick Jr.","I have been waiting over a year for something to come out related to the Nick Jr. series of Peter Rabbit and finally, it has arrived!This plate is just adorable!! My kids love it so much and it makes eating even more fun. The quality is great, as expected, by the reputable brand, Nuk. It's BPA-free and cleans easily. Three sections is nice to separate different foods. What's not to love!Would make an adorable Easter present.....or just an everyday present. Make sure to get the matching utensil - fork/spoon set too!",5
The First Years Star Teething Blanket,We bought this when my son was 3 months and not quite able to grasp items (but trying!).  It was easy for him to grab and helped keep him entertained on a long roadtrip.  At 6 months he still loves it.,5
"Woolzies 3 XL Wool Dryer Balls ,Natural Fabric Softener",They really do help laundry dry faster and come out less wrinkled!! Beware of the sound of drums coming from the laundry room though ( it sounds like when you dry running shoes!),5
"Bumkins Flushable Diaper Liner, Neutral, 100 Pack","Very harsh liner, similar to a dryer sheet - this gave my baby girl diaper rash which defeats the good of a cloth diaper. Bummer it is such a great idea.",2
KidCo Auto Close ConfigureGate - Black,We purchased this to put a barrier to our pellet stove because of the toddler grandchildren that are drawn to the flame like moths. Great construction and peace of mind make this the perfect gate system for us.,5
"Nuby No Spill Flip-it Cup, 12 Ounce, Colors May Vary","It's a good straw cup, yes when you bend it down to tuck it away some liquid stays there so when you go to open it then some water sprays on you big deal. Its water. I dont see how parents give carbonated drinks to their children in these cups and then complain about it fizzing out and sticky spraying all over, there wouldnt be a problem if it was just water or water downed juice.Anyways, does the job, my son likes it and the straw gets most of the water out maybe leaves an ounce of liquid that the straw does not get to at the very bottom. for the price not bad.for the varying colors part, it varies alright but this product is mostly pink and purple. So if you're picky about that then beware.cleans well, easy to put back together.",5
"Spasilk Soft Terry Hooded Towel Set, Yellow Ark, 3-Count",My little ones are now 4 months old (twins) and they are still using these towels. They didnt thin out after washing repeatedly and are still soft.,5
Graco imonitor Vibe,"I have had this monitor for 3 months now and I LOVE it! We don't have any problems with it interfering with our wireless network or cordless phones. We can hear the smallest peep from our daughter...even when she's playing quietly in her crib. The batter has been great too! I can have it on (off the base) for at least 10 hours if not longer. The vibrating feature is perfect for when I'm in a loud environment (like mowing the lawn, ect). I would suggest this monitor to anyone!",5
"The Grandparent Gift Co. Photo Frame, Baptism Handprint","Original.Very nice lookingAnd quite the idea.I bought it for my grandson's Baptism.My daughter loved it and she got a lot of very nice gifts.The frame comes with a sheet ALREADY palm-printed as a sample and for presentation purposes.The &#34;ink&#34; is on a cube around one inch square, stashed inside the clear wrapping, on the back of the frame.Safely tucked away, and disposable.Looking forward to seeing the actual prints and treasuring them for years to come.I would buy it again.",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","We received this seat as a gift for our newborn and thank God we did.  Our little guy would not sleep on his back or side at first so, like our oldest son, we set him in his carrier to sleep all bundled up.  We started using this seat for sleeping after we opened it.  It sits like a popasun seat.  Just wonderful for those babies that love to be cuddled.  Now he is seven months old and sits up in the seat and rocks while watching his show or while we need a minute to get soemthing doen and need the comfort of knowing that he is in a safe place.  It really is a great seat.",4
BabyMoon Pod - For Head Support &amp; Neck Support (Blue),"I bought this pillow when I noticed my 2 month old was starting to have an issue with flatness on the side of his head, where he liked to lay. We started using the pillow and the condition has improved slightly. It hasn't worsened! The only issue is when they get a little bit more mobile, like he is now, they wiggle off of it and it's not as effective anymore. Today I found him playing with it instead of laying on it. lol",4
"Carters Buddy Boa Blanket, Brown",I had bought a similar product years ago but the blanket was for older kids.  I bought this one for a 2 and 3 year old and it was a perfect fit for them.  They will enjoy it for years to come.  It was a hit as a gift for them.,5
"Lamaze Cloth Book, Panda's Pals",Not what we were expecting.  We did like the crinkly pages and it is well constructed but some of the rhymes were a bit over children's word experience.  Probably would not buy it again or recommend it to others.,3
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"These came on time, but my daughter was so tiny they wouldnt stay on. Well save them for the next baby & hope to get better use out of them",5
Graco Duo 2 in 1 Swing and Bouncer in Nobel,"Many great things about this swing.PROS:* Reclines* 6 speed settings* Many different sounds including classical music and sounds of the womb* 2 speeds for soothing vibration* Removable bouncer* Removable hanging toys* Tray for toys* Buttons light upCONS:* Straps aren't padded, a bit rough",5
"Summer Infant Complete Nursery Care Kit, Teal/White",Nail clipper fell apart with one touch- was never even used. The other pieces were ok. The Red Cross one I bought for my other son was better quality.,1
Sassy MyPhone,When I ordered this I thought each button made a different sound so I was pretty disappointed when I discovered that it repeats the same 5 or 6 sounds. I wish that each button made a different one.I'm keeping it because it's a decent size and because Sassy paint products typically don't have as harmful of chemicals in them as other brands.,4
Sassy Talk &amp; Fold Phone,Like the car in the parking lot with over senstive car alarm that continually goes off with many annoying sounds. Compiled with no off button or volume control this toy will soon become your least favorite of your baby's toys.,1
"Bunnies By the Bay Wee Skipit, Tan",I bought this little puppy for my newborn little grand daughter for Easter.  I actually thought that it was a bunny until I saw the tail when it came in.  It is still very cute...,5
Baby's First Five Years Book,"You know, this baby book was just alright for me.  Really, I think I would have rather gone to Walmart or something and purchased one from there because this wasn't any better than the average.",3
"CoCaLo Jacana Night Light and Switch Plate Set, Orchid/Lavender/Brown","This is very cute in our little girls' nursery! The elephant's tail had broken off when it arrived, but was easy to glue on with super glue (we thought this was much easier than doing a return/exchange).",5
"Ikko Oval Bassinet Pad- Medium, White",This bassinet pad is very comfortable and is a much better place for my baby grandson to sleep when he is visiting this summer.  The pad that came with the bassinet was very thin and hard.,5
"QuickZip Crib Sheet Set, White","Great concept...i was so excited to buy these sheets, but they are too big.  I washed and dried them (low heat) and they still remain too big for my colgate classica mattress.  Wish there was a way to adjust them.ADDENDUM (several mos later):Well, i just got over the fact that they are a little big and after my daughter was 4 mos, i used them regularly and the more they got washed and dried, the better it seems to fit.  Now, it is all i use...very very easy!",4
"Kids Line Disney Car's Nap Mat, Jr. Junction 21 in X 45 in (53.34 cm X 114.30 cm )","Perfect for daycare easy to wrap, easy to clean and the baby loves it! Second one I have bought! Excellent!",5
"Think King Mighty Buggy Hook for Stroller, Wheelchair, Rollator, Walker, 2 Pack",These are sturdy and look nice.  They may be a bit more expensive than other brand but there's a reason why. Good buy.,5
"Learning Curve True Fit Convertible Car Seat, Pink Butterfly","I have a four year old and a two year old and they both love their true fit seats. Mommy loves them, too. They are easy to install, especially as compared to the graco one we bought first. The no rethread harness is awesome. The seat was comfortable looking and big enough rear facing all the way until two years old, which is what the apa recommends.Pros:Big enough for a toddlerEasy to installComfortable for kids from infant to toddlerNo thread adjustable strapsCons:Very bulky. They fit fine in my odyssey (mini van) but not in my ford focus rear facing. Forward facing they fit in the smaller car ok.Catch a lot of stuff under the paddingCan't adjust strap length while in rear facing position. This is most frustrating, but not often an issue.Overall, we feel both our children are safe, and would recommend this for long term use to friends and family members. We are contemplating buying two more so we have matching seats in both vehicles. They are worth every penny.",5
Disney Minnie Fluttery Friends Window Valance,We got this to match our daughter's bedding and she loves looking up at Minnie! For the price very happy with the quality and could not ask for better for a toddler's room. It is very cute!,5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I really enjoy the pillow, though it does take up the whole bed...finally, a good night of sleep! Made my life better.",5
"Starting Small Monkey Novelty Hamper in Brown,  18 x 11 x 24",this item matched the nursery bedding we ordered so I went onand ordered it and when it came in it was simply adorable,5
Combi Cosmo DX Lightweight Stroller in Malibu,"I'm not exactly sure what some of the others were using but after three kids and about 7 different strollers this by far was the worst. We had my 5 year old sit in the stroller at the store and it worked fine then. It is completely different on the real streets of Queens, NY. I went shopping with my impatient hubby who says ""a stroller is a stroller"" , so not true. Yes it is compact but it takes a few tries to close it. We purchased this because the carseat attached to it. That was another nightmare. It takes so many tries to get it to attach after all those attempts your sleeping baby is now awake. There is cheap plastic on both sides of the stroller that you snap the carseat into. It becomes so hard to line up once the baby weighs about 12 lbs. The carseat itself is very heavy. So happy he outgrew it. Yes, my 9 year old can move it but it is not easy. You definitly need 2 hands to push. Since he can soon foward face in a carseat we are now shopping for a new stroller (dad will stay home this time). One with all the important features like large basket, one hand turning and closing, Parent and child tray. You don't realize how much you need that until its not there. If you need a stroller just for shopping in the mall or on other smooth surfaces it should be ok. But if you are using it everyday you probably won't be too happy. Good Luck.",2
"MOBI Tykelight WallMate, Monkey","This is a very cute night light!  I wanted something cute and unique for my infant son's room.  This fits the bill!  Now that he is mobile, he loves to crawl over and change the color of the light (the little button on the front).  I like to leave it where it changes colors, and he loves to watch.The only thing I might point out is that when it is lit red, it doesn't offer a lot of visibility.  The blue and green is much better for visibility.",5
"Tree By Kerri Lee Wooden Windup Music Box, Sunshine","Bought this unit as a replacement for a different music box that recently stopped playing after many years of use with our kids and more recently our grand-kids.  My wife really wanted another one that played Toyland, as our other one did.  We were overjoyed to find this one, but that joy quickly turned to disappointment when we heard the Terri Lee box in action.  The music sounds tinny and it plays the tune way too fast.  Not having an on/off lever is another downside.  We've always used our music box to lull the kids to sleep.  This one makes them hyper.  Overall, it simply sounds and plays like a cheap music box.  And given that it's not the most inexpensive one out there, I expected more.",2
Sealy Baby Firm Rest Crib Mattress,"Very firm but still seems so comfy. Just by lifting it you can tell it is a good quality mattress, I'm very pleased with it!",5
Primo Viaggio SIP,"This is a great car seat for newborns and very young infants, but if you don't want to turn around and spend another $200-300 as soon as your little one reaches 4-5 months, then don't get it.  I have last year's model, which is only slightly smaller with a 20 pound weight limit, but the same holds for this one because there are very few changes.  The seat is narrow, which is great for a newborn, but the height limit is 26 inches, and our not even 4 months old, 12 pound skinny and tall daughter is too tall for it, so we have to get a convertible seat to accommodate her height.  If you are a new parent, please do yourself a favor and start with a good convertible seat for infant-toddlers.  Britax makes the Boulevard that adjusts from 5 pounds to 65 pounds, and at $300 versus $229 plus $300 in four months, you'll save in the long run.  As much as I like this seat, it's safe, fits easily in the car, and snaps in and out of the base easily to transfer to the stroller, I would have rather started with the convertible from the get go and saved myself $229 to spend on diapers.  I echo another reviewer, live and learn.",2
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","The cheap umbrella stroller we purchased 2 years ago was wonky-wheeled and ready for the trash.  After reading many reviews and soliciting advice from friends and fellow moms, we decided to purchase the Jet.  Considering our 19 month old weighs 31 lbs, he biggest selling point was the 50-lb weight limit.  Unless you're willing to fork over a boatload of cash, the average lightweight/umbrella stroller won't hold a 40 or 50 lb. tot.  This is a great stroller for the price.  It looks nice, has a canopy, storage and handle-height comfortable for my 6'3 husband to push.  No, you can't fit a huge diaper bag in the under-seat storage basket, but if you're purchasing an umbrella stroller, you shouldn't expect all the bells and whistles.  We're very happy with the Jet so far, and so are my boys.  They fight over who gets to ride in it, so I'm anticipating purchasing another one soon.",4
"American Baby Company Organic Cotton Sweater Knit Blanket, Natural","Gave as a gift and the mother-to-be loved it.  I wished it would have been a lighter color, but it was so soft and gorgeous.",5
Dr. Brown's Drying Rack,It's perfect for Dr. Brown's bottles.  I use each rack individually otherwise it doesn't hold too many bottles but what rack does.I give it a five because I love Dr. Brown's products.,5
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","I got tired of all the ziplock bags we were constantly using so I got two different types of reusable snack bags for my daughter and I prefer and use this one the most. Anything and everything goes in this bag. The size is nice, you can fill it up with quite a lot of ""snacking material"". For a single snack (half a sliced apple or some carrots or a handful of crackers) I'd recommend the smaller size - less digging in the bottom of the bag but if you're only getting one or two bags - this will still work perfectly.Of course a major factor in picking this bag was the fact that it's BPA, lead and PVC free plus FDA approved.I love how easy it is to invert and clean. I especially like that it doesn't have a seam at the bottom (only sides) - this makes it super easy to get every pesky little crumb out. I am going to get a few more of these to make sure one is always available to grab and then there'll be no more wasting of plastic bags, which makes the ""little green voice in my head"" very happy.",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton",I had first purchased another cheaper front pack it was very hard to get on and babies head flopped unless you held on to her.I purchased the Bjorn after reading all the reviews and I am sure glad I did. No more hurting back and it is super easy to use. I can take the little princess out without waking her which is a good thing on a crabby night. She is 25 lbs now and we still use it. I am sad to say we are going to have to retire it now but shes 1 years old so its time. She loves to be held and being able to face outward she kickes her legs and smiles the whole time we shop.,5
Fisher-Price Adorable Animals Baby's Bouncer,"Our 5-month old has been enjoying this seat for a couple of months, but now in the past couple of weeks she has gone INSANE for the toy bar. When we want to stimulate her less, we use it without the toy bar and position her in front of the sliding glass door so she can watch the world outside. She loves the seat and I consider it a great value for the money. We have used it a lot, have left the vibration on overnight a couple of times by accident and still haven't had to change the batteries. A great, simple product design that works perfectly.",5
Smart Mom Teething Bling Donut Shaped Pendant Necklace (Onyx),My granddaughter is teething.  My daughter-in-law likes jewelry.  This is a perfect match for them.  I bought both the bracelet and the necklace.  Biggest problem my granddaughter has is deciding which one to put in her mouth!  Biggest problem I had was deciding which color to get!,5
Peg Perego Prima Pappa Multi-Position Leatherette High Chair - Tan,"My husband and I love this Highchair!  When we registered for this highchair I love the fact that it is so well made, looked comfortable and is compact.  Our darling Victoria at 9 months loves her hight chair too!  Besides eating in her chair she loves to sit in her high chair to look out the window to see what's going on.  Sure when it get's dirty from food and it gets into all the tiny crevices.  However, the straps come off easy to properly clean them in the sink.  The leatherette seat cover comes off and is easy to clean as well.  We received it from my co-workers as a gift!James and Mary",5
Fisher-Price Ducky Fun 3-in-1 Potty,I recently purchased the FisherPrice potty for my 18mo. old son because of the pee-pee guard & the fun ducky character. I found that the pee-pee kept adjusting itself wherefore wasnt very useful. Also the sensor inside the potty kept activating even if he didn't make a pee-pee and/or poop.,3
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe Organic Adjustable Infant Wrap, Ivory, Large","We previously used the fleece and the jersy version of this product and it was great! However this organic cotton version is simply awful! The fabric is too slippery. No matter how tight we wrapped our child, like an hour later most of this swaddle was arround her neck choking her! Its a real hazzard! Do not buy it!",1
"3 Sprouts Storage Box, Dog",This storage box is great for storing toys and cute enough not to look too out of place in a grown up apartment. Quality is ok.,5
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free Decorated Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology, 3-Pack",My lo takes this bottle better than any other bottle that we've tried. He is also less gassy with the Born Free bottles.,5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I'm not going to write a very long review because there are already over 700 hundred reviews for this product. Based on those reviews I bought this chair. My 11 month old daughter was in it for less than 5 minutes when she pulled the top tray right off, spilling the food onto the floor. I replaced it and she promptly did it again. I would suggest holding on to your receipt, if your child figures out the tray trick then return the chair, if not-- enjoy!",1
,awesome! it came quickly in the mail and was very well wrapped! i used it on cheese and it cut beautifully!,5
"Nuby 2 Count 2 Handle Cup with No Spill Super Spout, Colors May Vary","These are literally the only sippy cups we can trust!  We love them.  They don't leak, are easy to use, simple to clean and my daughter loves them.  Reasonably priced. Durable.  They are great.",5
"Elegant Baby 8 Piece Bath Squirties Gift Set in Vinyl Zip Bag, Sea","I got these for my daughter's first birthday to make bath time more fun.  She loves them.  Not just in the bath either, she plays with them all of the time.  Great size for her small hands to carry around the house - and also for throwing into the diaper bag to go out!",5
"BabyKicks Natural &amp; Organic 10 Pack Baby Wipes, Assortment",Fantastic reusable wipes for baby's sensitive bottom.  They wash up perfectly and are a great size.  Perfect for mothers who are concerned about using regular baby wipes full of chemicals.,5
Evenflo ABC SmartSteps ExerSaucer,"This is a great product with lots of sensory stimulation for toddlers, but there are many step to the assembly and lots of parts!",4
"Kushies Waterproof Bib with Sleeves, Blue Circle, Infant","Love this bib!  I was so tired of my son getting his sleeves dirty and stained every time he ate.  Even if I rolled his sleeves up he would still manage to get at least his elbows in the food.  With this bib, I've not had any more issues with stained sleeves.  It's also easy to clean.",5
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,"I've never been a huge fan of Medela products because Lansinoh is just as good and a lot less expensive. However, I grabbed these bags because I pump at work and being able to pump directly into bags would save the time. I was horribly wrong. Cleaning up spilled milk takes longer than transferring to bags from bottles. These are really awkward to use if you only have two hands (which I'm pretty sure most, if not all nursing moms do). The seals are really finicky and I'm always scared the bags are going to bust open in my pump bag on the way home from work. I've also had issues with the holes for the attachment ""hooks"" ripping. Add in the limited space for milk (5 oz as opposed to Lansinoh's 6oz bags with room to spare) and the milk that gets above the zipper seal while you're pumping (even with a Pump In Style), and these are just a bad product. I bought two boxes of Lansinoh bags today and I'll never try to switch brands again!",2
"Skip Hop Wall Decals, Treetop Friends",I put these decals up last night and woke up this morning to half of them in the crib.  I cleaned my walls prior to adhering them and had other decals on the walls prior to these that stayed up for two years.  Very disappointed.,1
"Vital Baby Toddler Straw Cup, Orange, 10 Ounce","After using the playtex sippy cups for the past year, we were looking for something with a straw that would help make the transition from sippy cups to regular cups. This fit the bill. It comes apart nicely, the straw helps my daughter build up her mouth muscles (according to her pediatrician, it's important for the mouth muscles to be built up for speech development), and my daughter absolutely loves it. Unfortunately, if it's laid on its side (as toddlers are prone to do), it can leak. It's not too big of a deal for us because she only drinks water in it, but it's something to be considered if you use the cups for other liquids.",4
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,"My baby girl just love it!  She can play it, dance and sing at the same time like a super star.",5
KidCo Magnet Lock Starter Set,"When we purchased our home, it was already baby-proofed from the previous family.  When our little one started crawling around, we didn't think we would have to do anything to baby-proof our kitchen and bathrooms.  However, the baby-proof locks that were already installed were the ones that allowed baby to open the cabinet door just enough to pinch her fingers.  We decided to look for something else and found these on Amazon.  After reading the great reviews, we bought a starter set.After putting the locks on our kitchen cabinets, I can attest to the fact that they work great.  We did not use the screws, just the mounting tape that comes with the set, and it sticks really well.  After letting the locks ""set"" for 24 hours, both my husband and I can tug on the doors and there is no give at all.  They were so simple to install - I couldn't believe it!  For our kitchen locks, we just put the magnetic key on our refrigerator, so we didn't even have to use the little key holder that comes with the kit, which is nice because looking at our cabinets, there is nothing sticking out that would be a cosmetic eye sore.We have ordered several more sets to use on the rest of our cabinets in the kitchen/bathroom.  The only down-side is that they are a little pricey, but worth the peace of mind to know that your little one isn't drinking a bottle of windex in the next room, or getting her fingers pinched every day.  My only complaint is that I wish they came in a jumbo pack!",5
Cradle Mattress - 18 X 36 X 2&quot; Thick,"My cradle came with the cheap 1' mattress and was old and torn so I bought this one because it is the only one I could find that is 2' thick. I give this mattress 5 stars because it is nice and thick and seems comfortable, and it was affordable.",5
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Sleeping Bag, Oh Boy, Small",Zipper broke after three nights use.  Seems I should have read the reviews because it seems this is a commen issue.  Hoping to return.,1
Boon Squirt Baby Food Dispensing Spoon in Orange,"Our four month old has never learned to use a bottle.  Now that she's old enough to have a little cereal mixed in with her breastmilk, this squirt spoon has been a savior!  Warmed up breastmilk + rice cereal in the squirt spoon is a HUGE hit.  It's SO nice to be able to feed her with such an efficient one-handed motion.  Beats the heck out of everything else we tried.  Had a bit of a problem when we did pureed apple and milk, since the apple skins would clog the opening a little.  Might've been how I pureed the apple.  But for cereal and milk?  AWESOME.",5
"Bumkins Junior Bib, Blue Fizz","The bib works great.  My 14-month old is not able to pull it off, which was our only problem with the other Bumkins.  The only problem with this is that it is very big -- so the pocket doesn't sit in the right place and catch the falling food.  But other than that, it does the job.  She'll grow into it.  As with all Bumkins, it's easy to clean off.  I wipe it off or rinse it off in the sink, then hang to dry.  I wash/dry them with the rest of her laundry every weekend, and it's held up fine.",4
The First Years: Clear and Near 2.4 GHz Monitor,"I put this monitor on my registry because the description said that it had excellent range and it had good reviews.  Well it does have good range but there is so much static and interference that I can hardly stand to use it.  I called The First Years customer service because I thought there had to be something wrong with it and they simply said, if you have a 2.4 GHZ cordless phone in your house, this monitor is not for you. I wish I knew that before I got it!  I got it as a gift, don't have the box anymore and have to go out and buy a new one.  I told the customer service rep that I also have a 900 MHZ phone in my house and she said then I need to get a monitor that is not in that range either.  Hope this info helps!",2
Summer Infant Day &amp; Night Baby Video Monitor with 5&quot; Screen - White,Item works great for the price. Love that you can shut video on and off so theres not a bright light at night. Also picks up every sound.,5
"Skip Hop Versa Diaper Bag, Cream Links",Love carrying it around and holds plenty without looking like a gigantic bag.  I've had several diaper bags and this fits my style best plus is totally practical.  Big fan.,5
"Ameda CustomFit Breast Flanges, M/L",I don't know if I did it wrong but I was unable to use this.  It did not grab like the standard one,2
The First Years Nature Sensations Dreams In Sight Mobile,"When I turned it on, the beautiful night light caught my baby's attention right away.  She loves watching the light.  Sometimes she watched it for too long, got overtired, and then cried :)HOWEVER, there was a big problem with this product.  It cannot fit to my baby's crib!!!  Just like what the other reviewer said, if you have a slightly more expensive crib, this unit may not fit to the rail.  But since my baby seems to love this unit, so I filed flat the top of the thread screw of this unit (I needed to remove about 4mm from it).  Now I can fit it to the crib.  Hopefully it won't break down or else I may have problem returning it.",4
Kung Fu Panda Movie 4 Inch Plush Figure Tigress,I really thought it would be a little larger than it really was. Overall my daughter loved her Christmas gift.,3
Lamaze Wrist Rattles,It looks cute on my son's hand but it does not solve the purpose.  The rattle sound is very feeble.,3
One Step Ahead The Big Gripper Slip Proof Bath Mat,I bought this mat for my elderly parents.  The tub they have is so old and its like a piece of iced glass when its soaped up and wet.  The mat gives them both the comfort they need and they can step in and out of the tup without slipping.  I'm thinking I should buy a few next time....,5
Natura Organic Baby/Toddler Cloud Pillow,"While some have commented that this pillow is a bit undersized, it seems about right for my 2+ year old.  She really likes having a pillow of her own.  Solid product.",5
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","Super soft makes up fo the pilling. My baby loves these! Not a tight swaddle, but great lightweight if you need a swaddle or blanket.",5
"Honeysuckle Breast Milk Storage Bags, 75 Ct (3 Boxes of 25 pcs)","I've been pumping and EBF for nine months now and recently switched over to these bags. I had such high hopes for them after reading the reviews and my initial experiences with them were fine. In fact, I love the design and size and the fact that I could lay them flat in the freezer and then move them upright for storage as a space saver. The problem?  I recently had two bags in a row leak. I have never had this happen before with any other bags and it was clear that the leaks were coming from the side seams and not due to punctures or improper sealing of the bags.  The bags were not overfilled or stored improperly.  It is so time-consuming and difficult to pump and try to keep up a decent stash that it was heartbreaking to see my milk go to waste like this. I was so upset that this is the reason I am writing this review -- I'm a frequent Amazon shopper but this is the first time I felt compelled to comment on a product.  I don't know if my remaining bags are okay or not but it's just not worth the risk.",1
Baby Knee Pads by Lil' Melon (No More Ouchies),"I bought two different knee pads from different companies (second was with pink rabbit), but found they are almost identical and both don't work. Perfect quality, looks great, but doesn't work. I am surprised to see the positive reviews. May be my child has an unique crawling style?  My baby is 7m old, active crawler, we have hardwood floors and she slides on them. I wanted to make her life a little bit easier by adding padding and some friction, but it didn't work.- The padding is too much, baby is not stable.- Slides on the wooden floor.- Doesn't stay on baby's knees.It actually should be a little bit below knees , but it doesn't stay there, slides on sides or down.- Baby hates them. It looks like she doesn't care how cute is it.I would suspect they can work for baby older, who just started to walk... but I don't think so. It can't be used on street, too white and porous.I usually don't request return, but spending over $15 on one more baby item which doesn't work was already too much. So many &#34;new products&#34; for babies don't work. Requested return.",2

Child Small Toddler Infant Plush Fur-Trimmed Santa Hat,"I bought this hat thinking that it was going like any other adult plush hat in a miniature version intended for a baby, but oh boy how I was wrong!.This hat is so cheaply made, the white fur fell off easily. The inner is rough and itchy, my son could barely stand it. I will recommend a different hat.I bought it because it was cheap compared to other brand, but I wish I had spend the extra on a higher quality hat.",2
Graco UltraClear Analog Baby Monitor,I've tried 3 other monitor before this one by different brands and they all have terrible bursts of static or don't work well. This is the first one that works well from upstairs to downstairs. The other reviewer posted about rechargeable batteries. I use mine plugged into the wall so I don't need any batteries...,5
Safeway Wall Mount Top Of Stairs Gate White 24.75&quot; - 43.5&quot; X 30.5&quot;,"After sifting through what seemed like thousands of reviews on various baby gates, my husband and I decided on the Safeway Gate and have been extremely happy with our purchase!This is an excellent gate for the top of a staircase.  It's kept my inquisitive 13 month old safe as well as the 25 month old and the 3 year old that I babysit.  None of the three boys have learned to open the gate yet which I find encouraging.  This gate has definitely passed the test in my book with three boys who try to hang off the top bar and shake it like crazy!I didn't find the latch to be difficult at all...of course I tend to push on the actual latch rather than the triangular button above to release the catch and open the gate.  I also like the audible ""click"" when the gate is securely shut.  Like others have mentioned, the lack of anything on the floor (bar, pad, etc.) was perfect since we do have ours installed at the top of a flight of stairs.A nice perk for small animals living with baby: We have 2-3 inch baseboards/molding at floor level so we installed the gate about two to three inches above that which gave just enough clearance for our three cats to slide underneath without letting our (then) seven month old crawl underneath.The downside is the installation process, but after reading the reviews we were prepared for that part and went to Home Depot and bought a simple $3 box of deck screws and it made installation much easier.This gate is a bit more expensive than some of the gates out there, but it's metal not plastic; secures with screws rather than pressure mounting against the wall; the rails are made vertically rather than horizontally or ""mesh-like"" holes (vertical rails help deter if not downright prevent climbing toddlers from getting over this gate) and we just decided that this gate was the best value and safest for our son (and his soon to be little brother or sister).",5
"Nuby 2 Handle Cup with Spout, 7 Ounce, Colors May Vary","I like this beginner sippy cup for our baby. It is easy for him to grab, hold and tilt. It does leak a few drops from time to time but I make sure the top is on real tight.",4
"Nuby 2-Pack Prism Orthodontic Pacifiers, 6-12 Months","I have searched high and low (and spent a lot of money!) for a pacifier that my son would finally LIKE! low and behold, super expensive ones don't compare to this pacifier!  this is perfect for him as he gets rashes around his little cheeks with other pacifiers...not this one, this has a gum soother and fits his little mouth perfectly. This one seems to have been custom made just for him. Nuby is a great brand. We love it!",5
"Summer Infant Sure and Secure Double Bedrail, Blue","The problem that I am having is that when I fold the rails down they hit the floor, we have tried this on two different beds and the same thing. The dimensions are very off unless you have a very tall bed! we had to go buy two different ones so that they fold down correctly. i would not recommend this.",2

GoGreen Champ&reg; One-Size Cloth Diaper (R2D-Poo),"My daughter leaks in these every time, they are just a poor fit for her.  They are also the bulkiest diapers in my diaper stash, which makes the fact that they leak even worse.  I also have a really hard time snapping the snaps, they are difficult unless you're Hercules......not fun with a screaming baby in the middle of the night.  They also leak through the PUL itself.",2
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"The Diaper Dekor works so well I keep it in my daughter's closet with her clothes.  Try that with a Diaper Genie!  I am amazed by the number of diapers it holds without sacrificing quality or functionality.  The one-hand operation is a life-saver.  Simply put, the Diaper Dekor is a must-have item for your nursery, whether you are using cloth or disposable diapers!",5
"Itzy Ritzy Wrap &amp; Roll Infant Carrier Arm Pad &amp; Tummy Time Mat, Social Circle Blue","This wrap and roll is soooooooo soft.  It alleviates the forearm pain of caring the heavy car seat, and also triples as a tummy time mat, and or a blanket! In addition it can be used as a changing mat!  So many uses.  Easily machine washable.  Great versatile item.",5
Munchkin Deluxe Baby Food Organizer,This is a great produst to have if you are using/planning on using jars of baby food. If you use the ones that are in containers (Gerber etc) this probably won't be much of a help to you as the containers don't really fit well on the racks.,5
"Graco Victoria Non Drop Side 5 In 1 Convertible Crib, White","Crib is not as beefy as other models found in big chain baby stores, but it will do the job. I highly doubt it will last through the years of intended/advertised use when converting to a larger bed unless the conversion kit has better quality wood attachments. The product could be labeled better as this would help when reading the assembly instructions. There are no crazy smells emitting from the product and that is a plus.",3
"Playtex Lil' Gripper/TrainingTime Straw Trainer Cup, 6 Ounce , Colors May Vary","I LOVE this cup and so does my son. I gave this cup to him at about 8 months old. It has a great squeeze feature for parents, so you can squeeze the bottle and the liquid will come up. That help alot so my son could learn that his drink was in there and he had so suck it to get it old. He is almost 11 months old and i still cannot find a straw cup as good as this one. I bought any other ones but it is WAY to hard to get liquid out, even for me.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","Was received in a timely manner. Upon receiving there were no nuts and bolts to assemble it. Once assembled it works swing wise. The sound volume doesn't work it is """"loud"""" or """"off"""". The lights are supposed to b on when the switch is flipped to a certain side. It works both sides. Sometimes it even stays on when the switch is in the """"off"""" position. Im not happy for the money i paid. I kept it because i did not want to wait for another.",2
"Boppy Total Body Pillow with Slipcover, Natural","I did extensive research and chose this pillow a couple months ago. I'm 8 months pregnant and just could not get comfortable at night. This pillow has made such a difference. It's soft, and can be molded into many different positions. After frequent use it does get flatter and the stuffing gets a little bunchy, but I prefer flatter pillows. Don't get this if you want something super thick and fluffy. But DO get it if you want something pliable but supportive. I highly recommend it!!!",5
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This a great tub. fits in the sink great, I purchased a small sponge to lay her on so she would not slip. I love that if folds up saves space. Only problem is shes getting to big for it  My daughter loves her tub time !!!",5
"FreeHand Mei Tai Baby Carrier, Theresa",I've used this a few times and its nice and light. It's also very comfortable to wear and easy to put on. My son feels very supported in it and he's so comfortable he falls right asleep when I wear him in it. Have recommended to many friends with young children.,5
Hudson Baby Plush Blanket with Satin Trim and Backing,The satin side was what I expected but the other side came apart easily. I bought it for my 6 month old baby and he could have easily gotten all the fuzzy parts that came off in his mouth and choked on it. It still did that after I washed it numerous times.,1
"The First Years 3 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce","I was unable to nurse my daughter the first months of her life and these bottles were recommended by the lactation consultants.  She took to the bottles right away and when the time came to try to nurse her again, she was able to latch and feed with ease.  Now, I can switch between breast and bottle in the same feeding with no issues as all.I have seen from some of the reviews people complain about leakage but there are just two things to remember to prevent it.  First, make sure the two nipples are properly aligned.  Secondly, if you start with wet ring or nipples then the water does leak.  You just need to wipe the rim of the bottle before putting it together.It is a great product!",5
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,I didn't realize the tentacles were horns when I purchased it-- I thought they were electric touch-sensors.  I like the horns much more since batteries are not required and I know it will not break easily.  My 4-month old son cannot squeeze the tentacles to make the noises (yet) but I'm having so much fun playing it for him!  He loves the different textures and colors of the fabrics.  I've already purchased two more for friends.,5

"Dr. Brown's Disposable Breast Pads, 60 Count","I have used these for 10 months now & can't imagine using any other kind of disposable breast pad! They may not absorb quite as much as some of the disposables I have tried but they are so much more comfortable. For me, they are just right during the day but they do get soaked at night.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Penguin","My almost 2 year old daughter totes this around wherever she goes and fills it with treasure. When we go to the church nursery or on a playdate, I keep the unsightly diaper bag home and fill this with spare diapers wipes, and clothes. It's a win-win for all of us since she wants to carry it herself. An adorable and fun purchase for sure!",5

"Foundations Quad Four Child Stroller, Blue","I am a family daycare provider that has four infants under the age of two. each child fits comfortably in the seats and enjoys their ride. There are a few set backs to this stroller. First it is really heavy when it is folded up, the stroller can get stuck in a locked position when trying to break it down, and the breaks rubs against one wheel . Other then that it does its job. I would not suggest placing a child younger then 6 months in this stroller, the seats do not recline all the way back.",4

Evenflo Splash Mega Exersaucer,"I have bought at least 5 Evenflo Exer-saucers over the past few years.  I have found the best price on Amazon...sometimes 1/3 - 1/2 the price at retail stores.  I can't say enough about this product and it's positive effects on babies 4 months old and up.  They can sit upright in a very safe seat with excellent support and see the world from a whole new vantage point at a very early age. One small drawback is that the item is shipped in the original box, no concealment or protective packaging.  That said, I have never received a damaged item even though the boxes have not aways been in perfect condition.",5
Jeep Jogging Stroller Weather Shield,"I purchased this raincover to use in a BabyJogger City Mini stroller since the original one is nearly double price. The size fitted very well. I wasn't sure about the quality of the plastic online but when I received the package it was fine, just as any other raincover nothing special. It is worth the savings. The only con I found is that although it attaches to the manuever it doesn't attach to the sides of the stroller so a strong wind blows it away and your baby may get wet (it happened to me) so I will have to manage a way to attach it. Delivery was fine, product was new when I received it. I would recommend it if you want to save.",4

Maxboost Designer Slim iPhone 5S/5 Case - Static Stripes,"I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation. I just got the iphone case. It is much more beyond my expectation. I am so attracted by its great quality and beautiful color design. At first, I was kind of struggling which one to choose, because they all look so good. And the fact is that they are. :) I am quite happy with it. It is free with great quality! It is the best!",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Microwave Steam Sterilizer,"My son is BFE, but when I was starting out and pumping to stimulate milk production... This was a life saver. In 2 minutes, all of my bottles and pumping gear was ready to go again, and I had the peace of mind in knowing everything was sterile. I am extremely happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend this to any new mom.",5
"Stokke Tripp Trapp Highchair, Red","I don't know how this chair has passed so many safety standards. They must not test it on carpet and with all table types because our son pushed himself back from the table today and the chair flipped backwards. He hit his head on a console table that was behind him, which was actually probably a good thing because it helped slow the momentum, but then he did hit the floor. It was the most horrifying thing for us so far. He is 11 1/2 months old. Please be warned that if it even seems like your child can push off the table with this chair do not use it.This thing is going to be torn apart and put out with the trash.In all fairness I must update this review...I am a huge proponent of parents taking responsibility for their children and after further review we saw in the downloadable safety information on this chair that there is indeed a tipping possibility if the chair is on certain surfaces and if they can reach a certain part of the table. So please, please make sure you do not fall into this category before buying this chair.If you are in the safe zone then I will have to say you may just love the chair as we did before the fall.",2
Safety 1st High-Def Digital Monitor,"it is a very good product. It has absolutely no interference with cell phones or other electric stuffs. It has also a very good signal (the quality doesnt get poorer when you are 100 m away from the base).The only bad thing about it is that there is no noise or alarm when it runs out of batteries, which is a weakness if you use it while you are sleeping. The clipper for the belt is also useless",4

The First Years Hands Free Gate,"These baby gates are awesome. They are pretty easy to install and if anything happens, in our case a peddle bent, you contact the manufacturer. They quickly reply and send a replacement. Sadly one of the spots we placed a gate was still too wide even with a set of extenders but we improvised with a couple of two by fours. I am happy to have bought these (we bought three & two sets of extenders.)",5
"DaVinci Porter 4-in-1 Convertible Crib, Cherry","We have had this crib for about 16 months now and I can honestly say it feels as sturdy as the day we put it together.  It was a bit of a building process but nothing out of the ordinary compared to other furniture we bought.  My son loves to run back and forth in the crib, jump on the mattress, dive in to the corners, and all other fun things that boys do.  The crib definitely gets abused and holds up beautifully.  I wouldn't recommend it but my husband has even crawled in once or twice and it's still standing.",5
"Pikibu I-See-You Car Family Mirror, Black","The box is cute with sayings about no longer having to look behind while driving when kids spill or are fighting with one another.  It also says &#34;Pikibu I see you!&#34; with the &#34;I&#34; as a graphic of a human eye.When I first took it out of the box, I was a bit skeptical because it didn't seem THAT much bigger than my current rear view mirror.However, when I put it over my current rearview mirror that came with the car, I realized how much of a difference it makes!  With the factory rearview mirror that came with the car, I could only use it to look out my back window at cars.  With this mirror, I am able to see my ENTIRE back window as well as a clear view of the entire backseat, from the left back window to the right back window!! I can see my daughters face, shoulders, chest, and then some!  She was suprised too because she kept saying &#34;Mommy! Mirror?&#34; and seemed delighted that we could both see each other's full face.  This is definitely worth the price and a must-have for anyone with children!!!",5
"Fisher-Price Two-Grip Travel Sippy Cup Hard Spout, Large  (Colors May Vary)",Not a bad sippy cup. Our 16 month old daughter refuses to drink from it. Not sure why. I wish she would. I like that this cup is taller and more compact and easy for her little hands to hold even without the handles.,3
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink","The chair came in quickly after I placed the order. It's very cute and I was happy with the price. When we attached the rockers it seems to lean backwards more than it should but I think maybe we need to adjust them to get the placement just right and maybe solve this problem. Other than that, love the chair and so does my little girl!",4

"Dreambaby Pressure Mount Hallway Gate with Extensions, Black","The gate works as described.  I prefer the Safety First Hands Free gate that I have in another area of the house, but it isn't long enough for the space we bought this gate for.  Guests can never figure out how to open it (the lifting part isn't intuitive).  I don't like that it automatically closes.  Some people probably like that in a baby gate, but I like being able to leave it open when the baby isn't around.On the positive side, the gate is very secure and attractive.",3

"SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket, Brown Mod Circles, Pastel Pink","I was given this blanket as a gift with my first son.  It was cute and seemed functional, and then I used it and discovered its magical powers. I quickly bought more, even though they are much more expensive than other blankets they are totally worth it.I couldn't figure out how the nurses could swaddle my 9.5 lb kiddo so tightly until I used this blanket.  He was so big that most of the other recieving blankets I had would no longer wrap around him correctly.  At 6 weeks old he slept for 6 hours straight, woke up to feed and went back down for 4 more hours!Fast forward 2.5 years later and he still naps under one of these at school, and sleeps with another at night.  The fabric has held up great even though they have been washed about a million times.  We used them as a play mat (my son had environmental allergies to molds often found in carpets), stroller cover, nursing cover, swaddling blanket, napping blanket etc etc etc.Needless to say I have ordered more for my second kid (so they both will have plenty), and I encourage everyone I know who is expecting to give these blankets a try because I know they will be just as impressed as I was.",5
BEABA Babycook PRO - Sorbet,"Our family was so excited to have received the item a week ago.  My wife was so happy that now she could make puree and all kinds of blending foods for our 6 months old boy. We like it that we can cook then blend in the same machine.  No need to use separated pot to boil veggies... However, the excitement didn't last long. Up to day fifth of usage, the Cook mode decided not to work anymore. We tested the blending mode and it's working fine. Pondering on what might have happened, we troubleshot with the manual, but didn't get any luck. I went online to find the manufacture help phone number.  Understandable that no one would work on a Sunday, I left a voicemail.  Luckily, I found the manufacture on Facebook, left them a message along with my contact info on there as well.  Next day, there was a reply on FB, asking us to call the customer service phone number. We thought that instead of replying to us, they should take the time and pass along our message to the customer service department, then they can take the initiate to contact us.  Something they should have done when their product is the one that in question here. But we called again anyway, figuring out that their CS department is probably too busy to listening to voicemail or getting in touch with their FB friends.  Still no one answered the phone. Left another voicemail.  Still no one to return the call. It gets to the point that we would need to send it back.  Too bad Amazon doesn't have the option for replacement, just plain refund. Wasting money. Disappointing customer service. Highly not recommend this product to anyone",1

Tiny Love Super Mat,"We had previously used a bunch of smaller mats, but this one has become the one that's taken over for everyday use. It's nice and large and gives a 6 month old baby enough room to start crawling. It's super easy to wash - just throw it in the washing machine and hang dry. We liked it so much we recommended it to my sister and her kid loves it too. This purchase is a no-brainer. I'd put it on my list of &#34;must-have&#34; things to have for a new baby.",5
BRICA Infant Comfort Canopy Car Seat Cover,"When this arrived, my early newborn was due for his first appointment the next day and there was also a thunderstorm that I was able to test this out through.

"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","I am very pleased with this purchase.  I decided to buy the seat to use whenever our out-of-state four year old granddaughter visits. She loved the seat when she went on a trip with us.  She said it was very comfortable, and she enjoyed having the drink holders.  She wanted me to take a photo of it to send to her parents so they could see it.  We used the harness position, and the seat itself gave her plenty of room.  It is heavy and large.  I would not consider trying to carry it in an airport or use it on a plane.  The firemen who installed it for me said they were impressed with the quality of the seat and how it installed very securely.  Best of all, I feel my granddaughter is as safe as she can be in our car whenever she visits.",5
Zanzibar - Car Seat Cover,"You should never use an after market car seat cover.  They are not crash tested with the car seat and could cause the seat to fail.  Also, for those that claim they are crash tested, parents should know that the US has no standards for after market products.  So, a manufacturer could literally throw the product at a wall and claim it has been crash tested.",1
Motorola Digital Audio Baby Travel Monitor,"The Motorola Digital Audio Baby Travel MonitorPros:No batteriesEasy to useCons:Not very loudWish:Either a louder speaker on the receiver or a more sensitive microphone on the transmitter. Unfortunately, where my baby sleeps isn't near a power outlet. The closest one is 5-6 feet away near the floor. At this range, I can barely pick up any cries unless he goes all out; by then it takes a while to calm him back down. I picked this up for its digital clarity (and it is clear!), but unfortunately it's too soft for my needs.  I have an older Sony monitor that was far louder/sensitive running on batteries; if only it was digital and static free.For most people, this monitor will live up to expectations.",4

Not only it's easy to use; it can hold up to 2 cups/bottles of almost any size, you can also put your cel phone or snack in the middle tray. It is easy to install and easy to wash. Great job, amazon!

"DaVinci Thompson 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","We ordered this crib thinking it was a great price for a solid wood crib, since the description states ""Made of solid New Zealand Pine wood from sustainable forests"".  I even saw another review that said they use non-toxic finishes and solid wood.  Maybe I'm the only one who actually knows or cares what solid wood looks like, but this is definitely NOT.  It's more like MDF with wood laminate over it.  And the weight limit on the bed (crib and daybed) is 50 lbs, which means no laying next to my kid when we turn it into a daybed.  So I give it 3 stars.  It's cute, and really for the price it's what I would expect.  I just thought I was getting a super good deal, and I wouldn't say it is that.  Holding up fine so far.  Some damage on pieces that are obviously from the manufacturer and not from shipping (they were in the middle of the box and the ones around it weren't damaged).  But my kid is about 30 lbs and jumps up and down on the mattress and the crib seems pretty sturdy in spite of it.  Just can't have both kids on there at the same time...",3

"NUK Ultra Thin Breast Pads, Pack of 2, White, 120-Count","I bought these because I couldn't stand how bulky the Lansinoh pads were and despite the negative reviews, wanted to give these a try. I don't leak a lot and have smaller breasts so I thought they'd be fine. Well, after using them for only 2 days I am compelled to write my first negative review on Amazon. These pads, in addition to being even lumpier than Lansinoh because they're flat vs. contoured, barely made it through one feeding before becoming saturated. Breastmilk leaked all over me, ugh. Kept trying them and they're just totally useless. Now I'm stuck with a ton of these things because of the 2-pack...maybe I can use them as coasters...",1
"BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Booster Seat, Gray/Black/Green","I was a little taken aback when I first removed this seat from the packaging, because it just didn't look like it would work. It has this flimsy looking fold that looks like it would collapse under any movement. I was pleasantly surprised. We used this for our 23 lb 14 month old for a road trip. It was perfect. It folds to nothing and is super light. My son was leaning and grabbing and the seat never faltered. It fit every hotel room chair we tried. I knocked off one star, because the clips for the strap that hold the travel seat to the seat of the chair are located in the middle. That means that one has to basically be on the floor, under the chair, in order to fasten the clip. It is hard enough for a parent with a toddler to maintain any dignity in a restaurant setting without beginning the affair by rolling around on the restaurant floor.",4
Animals Alphabet Baby Nursery Peel &amp; Stick Wall Art Sticker Decals for Boys and Girls,I get constant complements on how wonderful these are in my playroom from many visiting play dates!  It is great to see my son loving these and wanting to interact with them.  Great value and quality.,5

Earlyears Fill n Fun Water Mat Toy,"I bought this for my 10 month old nephew who has development delays in motor skills and vision. He refuses to lay on his tummy. This toy captured his attention long enough to spend time on his tummy. ( Which is a miracle) It's a great price, well constructed and just the right size. I would highly recommend this product.",5

"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",I was kinda hesitant of buying a car seat online but I went ahead and did it and I am so glad I did. Everything came in perfect condition. It is very comfortable for my 14 month old to sit in. I wouldn't go with any other brand.,5
Tadpoles Three Bulb Chandelier in Black Onyx,I bought this for our powder room that my husband uses as his bathroom. I decided not to hardwire it although that option is available.  It provides much needed lighting and the black color offsets any feminine attributes.  My hubby likes it.,5

"Dr. Brown's Designed To Nourish 6 Ounce Toddler Hard Spout Training Cup, Colors May Vary","I can throw this cup in the diaper bag with my expensive camera and NEVER worry about it leaking.  We got this for our daughter at 9 months and she could use it without a problem.  Our daughter prefers Dr. Brown soft spout, however, because the soft spout feels better on her sensitive gums.  This is probably not a problem if your little one is done teething up front.  All parts interchangeable with our Dr. Brown soft spout sippy cup.",4
"OXO Tot On-The-Go Drying Rack and Bottle Brush, Green","OXO really got this one right.  I travel with this handy set and am able to wash my dishes and dry them on a protected, clean surface.  The brush comes in two pieces, so once it is put together, you can easily clean any baby bottles, sippy cups or travel mugs.  There is also room to store a small bottle of dish soap, mini sponge, and travel cutlery in the travel container.  When opened, the travel box becomes a small, but incredibly functional drying rack.  This isn't rocket science, but it is useful.  And, the entire thing goes right in my dishwasher when I get home from a trip.  Two thumbs up!",5

Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub,"I normally don't write reviews, but had to for this treasure...1. First of all you do SAVE MONEY by not filling up the whole tub. Awesome!2. It's cushiony all over so no need to worry about the little one getting bumped.3. Personally, I consider the price of this item pretty cheap too. :-))To keep the bambino from sliding, I use a big yellow sponge for her to sit on.A pearl for protecting eyes and ears during shampooing consider the ""Lil splash guard"", also on Amazon.Happy baby washing,J.M.",4
Leachco Bath 'N Bumper - Cushioned Bath Tub - Blue Fish,I gave the product 2 stars because I really loved it at first.  It was a great transition tub for my 7 month old.  However with it having soft beads as the support it does not dry easily.  I squeeze the tub as dry as I can right after every use and hang it up.  However it doesn't fully dry in 24 hours and I noticed black spots that I can only assume is mold after about a week.  I tried cleaning it and leaving it in the hot sun to completely dry and the black spots came back.  The tub even has a smell to it like wet towels left in the locker room.I would recommend an inflatable tub.,2
"Protect-a-Bub Single Compact Sunshade, Black","I saw this item in amazon and bought it. It did not fit the stroller. Both the stroller and the shade are from same company. I attempted to return it.

Baby Einstein Neptune Ocean Adventure Gym,"I love the baby Einstein line of products and this one was no dissappointment either.  Eventhough I did have one gripe, and that was the storage unit.  The snaps are flimsy and one broke, preventing me from storing the gym away properly.  Other than that, love it.",5
"Infantino Twist and Fold Activity Gym, Vintage Boy",I used this mat mostly in our living room when my son was around 3months old. He loved looking at the animals and learned how to raise arms by grabbing them. My son loves tummy time too so whenever he's on tummy time he would play with the velcro on the mat. He loved staring at the colors and the patterns of the mat. And he loved the mirror too. I like that you can move it around. I also like that it folds like an umbrella.,5

Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,Very convenient! Easy to assemble. Gate swings both ways. Great for keeping my dogs where I want them. Good buy!,5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I am pretty happy with my daiper genie.  I haven't tried other diaper pails for comparison, but this one does the trick, and helps control odor.  Its roomy enough that I only need to empty it every two or three days with size 3 diapers.  To help with odor control I spray with lysol each time I empty it.  It is easy to change the refills, but there is one ring inside that is difficult to fit in place when changing the refill.",4
Fisher-Price Hoppy Days Bouncer,"This was hands-down the baby product we used the most. Our baby loved to be bounced more vigorously and liked the strong vibrations. When it seemed like he didn't like the vibrations anymore, we just turned them off.I've never tripped or stubbed a toe on the legs, but I like that the legs are wide-set because it gives the bouncer a more balanced base and more support. I don't worry about tipping. We haven't had a problem carefully stepping around it.I think one of the best features is the simple toy bar that is removeable. It's got 3 toys and the middle one plays a song. Much like every other toy that plays a song, it gets annoying, so we taped the pull handle to the frog's body so he couldn't set it off anymore. The toy bar is so easy to remove and set aside, so that he can just bounce without the other toys swinging violently and being noisy.The price is right--at $35 it's $20 cheaper than many other seats and the other ones he's tried he just doesn't like, because he can't get a good bounce going. If the toy bar is too boring, you can attach some other toys with links. Save yourself some money and buy this basic bouncy chair over the expensive ones with more bells and whistles. The baby will never know the difference.",5
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary",This is a must have item.... I've been using the Avent warmer and it either made the bottle too hot or not warm enough and in the middle of the night it is a hassle to have a bottle that is not ready for a screaming baby. So this warmer it is great although the instructions tell you to use 7oz of water for 4 oz of milk... I find that the milk doesn't get warm enough so I use 8oz and it works great. The only thing that I wish it could improve is that you have to put water every time you warm the bottle. I think it should automatically refill it self after each use.,4
"Peg-Perego Vela Easy Drive Stroller, Geranium","Both my wife and I wanted a good lightweight stroller, easy to use (folds and opens easily, turns nicely, etc.) with accessories such as a tray for the baby and a decent sized basket - all for a reasonable price. The Peg Perego Vela 2011 satisfies all of these requirements, and is great to look at. At the store, we found it very light and easy to move around. The baby harness I think is actually a plus compared to the others. Everything from the big to the little features felt really good.However, cut to a month and a half later - we've been through 2 of these now and the problems other reviewers have mentioned about the front wheels became an issue for us as well. The 1st stroller we had stopped turning left (unless you moved it back and forth more than a few times) after the first 3 weeks. We returned that and got another piece. The 2nd stroller though lasted only 2 weeks before the front wheels buckled on the side walk and then wouldn't turn well in either direction while moving forward. And we were actually being extra cautious with this one as we didn't want it to break down! Another problem we noticed with both the Vela strollers is that after a couple of weeks the front wheels started squeaking real loud at times.My conclusion is that it's a great concept for a lightweight stroller but its too fragile for any kind of daily use beyond taking it on smooth flooring. Definitely note the reviews here on Amazon about the front wheels - they are very fragile and will break down at some point before long. It's very disappointing because my wife and I liked it a lot (as did our son) and we really, really wanted it to work out for all the positives mentioned. But I am not willing to give the Peg Perego Vela another try after having tried out 2 of these. Lovely concept but poor execution by Peg Perego on the Vela.",2

Fisher-Price Zoo Friends Musical Gym,"Our baby loves playing with his toys on this mat -- I bought it for its compact size since our living room is fairly small.  It's just right at this point since he's not yet rolling over.  However, I realized that the small size means he doesn't have room to attempt rolling over either.  So I'll be buying a larger one he can use for the coming months.  But we're enjoying it now!  Finally, Mom and Dad can actually eat a meal without holding baby, since he'll lay and play with his toys!  :)",4
Fisher-Price OpenTop Take Along Swing - Oatmeal Animals,"My son is very colicky and this is the only swing the he liked.  It is great if you have a child that does not like anything over his head.  My son is very easly over stimulted and this swing is great for him.  It is just a basic swing, it calmed him nicely and let me eat.  I only wished that it would go a little faster",4

"Lansinoh mOmma Straw Cup with Dual Handles, Orange","We love this cup and have ordered a second one.  It took us a try or two to assemble it properly, but once you have the straw inserted correctly and the lid screwed on properly, it works like a charm!  No spills, even when dropped from a few feet or tossed across a room.  You won't find a puddle in the diaper bag (which we have with other sippy cups) if you toss this in with the lid closed, it's fantastic.  It also does well on the top rack of the dishwasher.",4
Fur with Satin Blanket - Blue/Brown Geometric,"My son wanted a snugly blanket and this one fit the bill. It is soft and cozy on one side & silky on the other. The colors are not baby-ish so he approves. The blue color is the fuzzy side and is almost a grey/blue color. Not baby blue for sure. The brown side looks somewhat masculine, but still has a sweet design suitable for a baby. It is chocolate brown with blue scalloped diamond shapes and a blue flower petal like design inside each diamond. The blue matches the fuzzy side perfectly. It is very cute.The fuzzy side on ours has started to look worn and isn't nearly as soft as it once was. Perhaps if it were a shorter pile it wouldn't look so worn. My youngest son has had one similar to this but the pile is very short. Almost like velvet but its ultra soft fleece. His has held up for almost 8 years & is extremely soft, even after all these years and hundreds of washings. This particular one in review however, has only been washed a handful of times over the last year. It honestly doesn't see a lot of use. I probably would not purchase for a little one as a long term security blanket. I just don't see it staying soft for as long as a baby to toddler would have it, Or like mine who still sleeps with his almost 8 years later! If you intend it for that purpose I suggest buying multiple blankets to have replacements on hand.For what we needed it for it is perfect and my son is happy, that's what's important.",4
"The First Years Take &amp; Toss Straw Cups, 10 Ounce, 4 Pack","My daughter drinks out of these when we are on the go, as to not spill so much on herself or in the car if she drops it, and they are perfect! And if they get lost, no big deal since they are so affordable!",5

"Playtex Nurser With Drop-Ins Liner, 4 Ounce, Colors May Vary, 3-Count",I looked into these bottles because I was going on a camping trip and wanted to make life easier on me. I was using the Dr. Brown bottles but they are such a pain to clean especially if your camping. I read some reviews on these bottles and heard they were better then the Dr. Brown bottles so I tried them out. my son was still spitting up a little with the Dr. Brown bottles but now he dosen't spit up at all! I am sold on these bottles. I would say the liners are kind of a pain only because you have to buy extra and you have to make sure you have extra in your diaper bag. But it is worth the change in my son!,5
"Baby Jogger Bassinet, Black","We loved using the city mini bassinet for our baby and got so much use out of it. We started using it as soon as we got home from the hospital, and took her for many walks in it. It is padded with foam and our baby slept very comfortably in there during walks. It easily disconnects from the stroller base, and is not too heavy. I used bassinet sheets to line it, they fit perfectly and made it easy to clean. The mosquito net that it comes with was also excellent for blocking out sun and anything from blowing into the bassinet. We used it until she was about 3 1/2 months old...because she was so tall and grew out of it. I would have kept using it otherwise.The only issues I had with the city mini bassinet are 1. the price--however, we were lucky enough to find a gently used one on craigslist that was in perfect condition, for half the price....I definitely recommend doing this. and 2. The hood is sometimes a little tricky to put down because you have to press both buttons down simultaneously...while also pushing down the canopy, which is hard to do....I figured out a system that worked, so it wasn't a big deal.",5

Peg Perego Duette Twin Stroller - Toffee,"I've really enjoyed my Duette... sure it's heavier than others, but it's more stable that anything else I've looked at... and BELIEVE ME I shopped around!!  Like the other mom said, if you're a whimp or you have a tiny car don't buy it and then whine about it all over the internet.  This is a very versatile stroller that's also gorgeous.  And when it comes to having a steering wheel... you can't get any better!  I've read so many reviews about front to back doubles that are ridiculously hard to steer.  Anyway, I love it!",5
OWL GREEN Baby Leggings/Leggies/Leg Warmers- GIRLS &amp; ONE SIZE by BubuBibi,"My daughter is almost four months old and in love with her toes, I wanted something to keep her warm but allow full feet access.  I keep my house around 70 degrees and I usually keep my sweet girl in footed sleepers when we are hanging around the house.  They are a little long at the moment so a lot of the time she looses her toes because she is pulling them off, but she will grow and she seems to enjoy the challenge. Our baby's room has an owl theme so these adorable owl leg warmers fit perfectly into our decor.  I like that they have pink but are not overwhelmingly pink.",4
Kidco Mesh Window Guard,I would love to be commenting on the assembled product but unfortunately I can't even put it together.5 out of 8 of the small screws supplied are Y shaped and there is no mention of needing special tools to assemble. The instructions look pretty simple and I had everything I needed to put it together except a crazy Y shaped screwdriver. I will follow the advice of a few others and pick up some proper small screws when I am able.,2

"Go Mama Go Designs 38 Pack Wonder Bumpers, Pink/Chocolate","Wow, I had reservations about spending this much money on bumpers. It's crazy, right? Yes, but crazy-worth-it.Before we had these bumpers, the baby would wake up EVERY SINGLE TIME that he touched a crib slat. Every time! So one good roll and you're at the slats, waking up. With these bumpers in place, he almost never wakes himself up. He'll just grunt a bit, readjust and then go back to sleep. He even will reach out and rub the fabric a bit (it's soft and apparently reassuring) while he goes back to sleep.A SLEEP SAVER. Worth every penny, I promise you that.",5
"Britax Pinnacle 90 Booster Car Seat, Broadway","I got this car seat solely based on the ratings. Holy cow! You can send a kid to the Moon in this. It is huge. The directions are a bit confusing as it has so many little moving parts. It really takes 2 adults to install it in the car. One to sit in it and one to fasten the latches. Once it's in, it will not budge. Trust me, you really don't want to move this once installed.Warning: it doesn't fit in the standard carseat bags that you use for the plane bag check.",5
"Britax Boulevard 65 CS Click &amp; Safe Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","After doing a good amount of research, I've come the conclusion, this might be a top of the line product in the USA, in terms of US safety standards, but they have safer car seats available to UK parents.For this reason alone, I am profoundly disappointed in this company. After all, who would make a decision to sell a much less safe product for American children to use, simply because there is a lower threshold of safety standards they need to meet here. The reason isn't cost, the European product is safer AND less expensive - I sincerely doubt it costs less to manufacture in the UK, than it does in the USA, and what about free trade?I ask North American consumers to compare the Britax Evolve 1-2-3 Graphite available in the UK ($175 US dollars) to either the Britax Marathon, Britax Diplomat, Britax Boulevard (with its ""True Side Impact protection""), Britax Advocate, Britax Decathlon, Britax Regent, or even the Britax Frontier - their entire US Line! The UK product's seat cushion is at least 1/3 thicker, also reaches further forward to protects children who lean forward to see out the window.The much touted Britax Roundabout available in North America for ($200 USD), again offers relatively small amount of side impact protection to its UK counterpart Baby Safe Plus which costs only $140 US dollars. I believe if you call the company they'll blame US regulation, but it seems to me, US regulations allow safer products to be sold - these products exceed our regulation standards.The level of importance you ask? according to a WSJ article:""Years of collision data confirm that side-impact crashes tend to be more severe than other types. Such crashes have a significantly higher fatality rate among children up to age 12 than front or rear collisions, according to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Center for Injury Research and Prevention. Side-impact collisions also result in more-severe injuries at lower crash severities than frontal ones.""What kind of company would make such a decision to sell a much less safe product at a higher price to parents of American children, because it can? I'm disappointed. I wish there was a better American made option!",3
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","In late June, I ordered this for my visiting grandchild, a six month old boy of slightly above average height and weight for an infant his age.  He is certainly not as big as any one year old  The dinner tray had to be placed on the second of three settings for distance from the back of the seat to comfortably seat him.  The space added by moving the tray away only allows perhaps one inch increments of space.  Since the baby couldn't sit up two months ago, and I presume he will continue to grow, this seat will likely need to be replaced by Christmas.  Size aside, the product is well made., light weight, very portable, and mostly easy to clean. The ""mostly"" refers to the webbing for safety belt, anchoring and carrying straps; which aren't removable.  I read another reviewer's comment about this and wisely chose a seat with colored webbing rather than white (at least juice and veggie stains will be less obvious).-For other Grandparents;  this is light weight and easy to travel with, How much easier to stow away when the babies aren't around than the standard highchair. My only reservation is the size.  When my grandson doesn't fit anymore, I will be keeping it for my Grandparents' loaner network. Ooh, maybe more grand babies?!",3

BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,"For the first year of my first child's life, we used cloth bibs. Large bibs, small bibs, waterproof bibs, velcro bibs and snap bibs. After every meal, I found myself cleaning baby, myself, and the highchair. At least until these bibs came from Amazon on the recommendation of another parent.While I still occasionally have to clean the high chair, I can confidently feed baby right before pictures or formal dinners, without any worry about mess or dropped food. They clean up easily, fasten on a variety of neck sizes (from ages 1 to 2 thus far, with space for the next year or so), and baby never seems to take them off the way he has others.The only downside I've observed is that baby will recycle food from the bub trough back into his mouth, which, while gross to me, is almost like instant composting.",5
"Prince Lionheart Flexibath Foldable Bathtub, White","This is the transition tub for my son after the traditional &#34;reclined&#34; infant tub became dangerous as he would always try to sit up straight in it and would slip.  Needed something that wouldn't take up much space (this folds up slimmer so it fits nicely under the sink), needed something convenient (unlike those inflatable tubs) until baby is big enough for the entire bathtub.  This was it!  It does get a little slick since it's smooth plastic, so if you have a squirmy baby, beware that they may slide backward and potentially go under the water.  But, it's not like you're gonna walk away with a child in the tub (right?).  This also makes a great portable basin for things like:  instant &#34;sea&#34; for floaty toys - hand-washing clothes - carrying an ungodly amount of toys outside on a sunny day - bathing the cat (don't ask...);  so I can see keeping this nice little tub around for long after its intended use has expired.",5

"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny",My sister gave me the Boppy swing that her kids had used and my son liked it but it didn't always calm him down. I went to a friend's house and put my son in their Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing and I became a believer...purchased one the next day even. This swing does it all and I like that I can rotate the seat to swing back and forth or side to side. It immediately saved me from having to carry my son around all the time and I even got to eat lunch every day because of it! My son loves this swing even if it's not rocking and will stare at the mobile and mirror above for quite a while before becoming bored. I do wish it could be moved around the house (it's very bulky and heavy) but not a deal breaker as I have positioned it in my house where I can see it from a few different rooms.,5
"Bumbleride Indie Twin Stroller, Lava","So I got the indie twin... I deff love it ill give you a few pros and cons... Explaining why I couldn't give it 5 stars.Pros:Rides so smooth(my 2nd child hasn't arrived so I haven't gone on long walks yet but seems to maneuver nicely)Big canopy hoods to cover sunGreat customer service( don't open/close the canopy unless its attached to stroller this causes the legs to get messed up. I broke mine on first use but they are sending me a new canopy)Narrow-fits thru my front doorAdjustable handle barAll terrain rubber air fill tires(not the plastic ones on citi mini)Cons but def not deal breakers:Hard to fold up(my arms are short and you have to pull both levers at once. Maybe I will get used to it)Doesn't come with accessories(after you pay between $500-$600 it would be nice to get a car seat adapter, bumper bar, snack tray or extra cup holder)You have to remove the cup holders to fit thru narrow spaces i pictured myself spilling drinks in the store. they attach to the sides and they only give you 1 anyways-I bought the britax drink caddy instead and it fits the indie perfect! I love it)They send you some safety strap but i can't find in directions what or how you use it?So all in all it's a fabulous stroller. Great quality. Bumbleride could benefit from throwing in some of the accessories.. Or maybe offer a deluxe model with all the accessories for a little more and a reg model to buy without anything. To have to buy each access separately offers flexibility but its a pain.Can't wait for LO to use it daily! It's going to be great for the bike path, mall, beach and lots more!!",4

"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn","I received two of these for my baby shower.  I thought I'd love them but I just like them.  I like that it zips from the bottom up, it makes diaper changes really easy at night.  I like that it takes the stupid out of swaddle- in the middle of the night the last thing you want to do is waste time wrestling with a too small receiving blanket when you just want to go back to bed.  I like that it's warm, we don't have to keep the house too warm at night when he's in one of these.I don't like that the fleece gets ratty after a couple of washes and gets pilly.  Our son is only three weeks old and these things already look rough.  I also don't like that it's really hard to burp the baby when he's wearing this, you basically have to take it off of him to get a good burp- more than a slight annoyance in the middle of the night.  I also find that the arm holes are really snug.  As I mentioned before our son is only 3 weeks old, but he was a big baby and over 10 lbs at birth.  He's not a fat baby though and the arm holes are really narrow and can be difficult to put on when he's not feeling like cooperating during clothing changes.  We have these in the small size which should fit fine for his size.So, I would recommend these, but sometimes the cons outweigh the pros.",4

It doesn't get more simple than that.We use the &#34;Maxi Cosi Mico AP Infant Car Seat, 0-12 Months&#34; with the adapter and it sits on it just fine. Attaching the car seat to the stroller takes a few seconds for you to line up the car seat holes with the adapters.It seems pretty sturdy so I have no complaints for this adapter.",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,"I ordered this baby monitor to replace an expensive Sony monitoring system I had gotten that was terrible.  This VTech monitor is great! Easy to use and works perfectly.  I highly recommend it.  Only """"con"""" I can find is that the parent unit screen does not light up.  Sometimes hard to find buttons in the dark.",4
Snugli Front and Backpack Carrier,"This carrier is just fantastic! The lower strap that goes around your hips really helps to prevent any back/shoulder strain from using this carrier. It is designed much the same way that hiking backpacks are and is really comfortable. My baby loves riding in it, and the straps for holding her head are easily adjustable so that while she is facing inwards I can losen them while she's awake and wants to look around and tighten them when she falls asleep to keep her head from rolling around, all whithout waking her up. I like the fact that unlike the Bjorn carrier the straps have clips. It's a small thing but it's faster and more convinent for me not to struggle with threading straps. This carrier does have a lot of straps to adjust however! It's all for the sake of making the carrier customizeable for each adult but this can be confusing at first so be warned. You want to take this carrier out of the box and familiarize yourself with all the straps and adjustments you can make before you need to use it for the first time. You can easily adjust while wearing once you are familiar with the carrier, however. All and all I'd say that this carrier is simply wonderfull, and the price (half of the Bjorn carrier's price) makes it even better.",5
Funky Lines Single Bar Grip Covers,"Almost fits well.  I do love the texture of this product, just wish it was slightly wider. My stroller handle bar is kind on wide and this fits only because I really stretched it.",4
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","I had the chair 2 years ago with my first, but my brother ended up breaking it on us.  We got the same chair this time around because I wanted something that was going to last me awhile.  We like this chair! Our newborn very often sleeps in here, thanks to the recline feature (wasn't on our first chair). When the baby isn't in it, my 2 year old will put the kickstand in and sit in the chair.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the cow on the toy bar...my 2 week old loves to stare at it, but it faces the wrong way!  As for it tipping, with our first, we didn't  let him rock when he was learning to sit up.",4
"Ju-Ju-Be B.F.F. Diaper Bag, Black/Silver","I bought this for my wife to take on a flight with her along with our (at the time) 5 month old daughter. She said it was a real life-saver. It held everything she needed for the 7 hour flight, and she could wear it as a backpack while carrying our daughter in a carrier on her front.",5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","This is a great little travel bed for a toddler.  Much lighter weight than a pack n play, but it does required getting your little one to sleep in a bed where s/he can just get out and walk away if they are so inclined.  Once we got our son to sleep, he slept very comfortably.  Seems like sturdy construction and will likely last a while.  Great value at only $20!  Gives your kid their own special spot when sleeping away from home.",5
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","I have a 43 lb. four-year-old who still fits in his Marathon but we needed a new carseat for another car.  It was between the Graco Nautilus and the Frontier.  I really wanted to love the Nautilus because Consumer Reports recommends it over this model and it has to be easier to install than this one (& it's less expensive).  However, when I bought both of them & set them up in the living room it was no contest.  Sure, they are both well-constructed and are made of high-quality materials.  Both were easy to adjust and the Nautilus got fab reviews from CR (although both were rated as  safe choices).  But, even on the loosest setting the crotch strap on the Nautilus was barely big enough for my son!  He fit perfectly into the Frontier and has of room to grow.  He loves the seat, especially the 2 cupholders (one for his cup and one for sunglasses).  This thing was a BEAR to install though-- much more difficult than the Marathon b/c I needed to use a locking clip (which incidentally doesn't come with the seat which is a pain if you (or your kid) is excited to install it the day that it arrives.  Yes, they sent it within a couple of days, but why not include it in the box?  It can't cost more than $0.50.  The locking clip is included with the Nautilus.  Anyway, it's in now and we like it and I would recommend it for any slightly larger than average toddler.  If your child is tall and slender the Nautilus might be a good choice for you too although this one will also accomodate a slender child (3 leg settings).",5
"Graco Cozy Dinette Highchair, Mickey",Excellent Highchair for infant to toddler. Take out dirty tray for cleaning to expose clean tray when behind in dish washing. Very conveniant folding system for out of the way storage.,1
"Summer Infant Deluxe Piddle Pad, Black - 2 Pack","I bought 2 of these for my car seats. The pad for my convertible car seat (Recaro Signo) fits well, stays in place, and does the job. I wash it in the washer, air dry, and it looks good as new. The one for the 3in1 Graco Nautilus doesn't stay well and ends up bunching up.  I would recommend this for infant and convertible car seats, but not for seats that sit upright and are flat (like boosters/combo seats).",4
"Pumpin' Pal Super Shields, Angled Pumping Flanges, the Best Flanges By Far in a Complete Set of All Sizes Mom Will Need","My breasts are large (pre-pregnancy a D; post-pregnancy an E / F), so the largest shield ended up working great.  Kind of wish I had just purchased the one set of large shields, but I wasn't sure what I would need, so I guess I do like the options that a multi-size kit provides.  Apparently they're the &#34;Best Flanges By Far&#34;, and I am completely satisfied with using them with my Medela Pump in Style breast pump.  Didn't ever try the Medela flanges, but I trust the Pumpin' Pal company and all the other reviews when they say they are more comfortable than Medela's flanges because they really are totally comfortable.",4
"DaVinci Kalani 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","The color is not as dark given it's expresso.  I prefer the lighter version anyway.  The frame is solid and the wood is heavy.  My husbnad was able to put it together without any issues; however, the toddler rail was cracked where the screw hole was created.  We plan on using some wood glue and hope that does the trick.  That's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.",4
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Newborn Flow Nipple, 2-Pack",i went on the avent site and this product does not show up as bpa free.  can anyone confirm this?  the ad is misleading to say bpa free.,4
Lambada Binkie Towel Doll,People bought a similar lovey for my son years ago and I bought this for a friend who had a baby and she loves it. Baby loves it too. High quality lovey that is heirloom quality.,5
Zo-li Replacement Bot Straw with Brush (2 Straws 1 brush),I got this for my granddaughter.  The original straw is lasting much longer than I thought.  Haven't had to use the replacement yet.,5
Lamaze Tug &amp; Play Activity Knot Take Along Toy,"This is one of the toys we reach for most often with our 6 mo.  Our only complaint is that the stuffing of the 'arms' were compressed during shipping, and so a couple of the arms are a bit floppy. The toy is like an activity center, with so much to do in one compact location.",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Our grand daughter is 5 and a half months old. She absolutely LOVES this musical toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! She pushes the center of each square with her fingers and toes...adorable. Each side plays a different instrument! I highly recommend this toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,5
Sunshine Kids Easy View Back Seat Mirror,"This mirror is the perfect size and actually stays in place when I go over a bump, unlike other mirrors. It is high enough for our son to see himself as well.",5
"Inglesina 2013 Fast Table Chair, Liquirizia","I have a house with a large, long kitchen bar, so we bought this in place of a standard high chair. And it's been a lifesaver. Out of all of our baby's &#34;spots&#34; (floor mat, exersaucer, etc) this is his favorite place to be. He gets to watch me in the kitchen, have access to a counter full of toys, and he loves the high vantage point.  I think it's really comfortable for him, too.The chair disconnects easily for travel, and we've used this at the grandparents' houses to great success. Because of its cinch grip design, this seat has fit on counters and tables that none of the similar models will fit on. It is as steady as a rock too. I was a little apprehensive putting my baby in it at first, but it is VERY secure.Some reviewers complained that it got messy, but..... it's a high chair. For a baby. What do you expect? Just buy a dark color and rub it down with a rag every now and then. It will be fine...If you have a kitchen counter, this is a must-have for parents and baby.",5
Hevea Panda Teether,Really nice teether.  Easy to clean and my infant loved it before we lost it during a grocery shopping trip :(.,5
Lamaze High-Contrast Flip-Flop Bug Rattle,great size and shape for fat little hands. well made and bright colors. the little ones like these rattles very much.,5
The First Years Breastflow Mipump Single Electric Breast Pump,"This pump died on me only after one month of use. One month! The suction went out first and then it just stopped working. I guess you get what you pay for. And while it was working it was a pain to clean and the although not super loud, the noise it makes while pumping is really annoying. If you want a pump that is reliable, super easy to clean and use get the Ameda Purely Yours, but whatever you do stay away from this one.",1
Push Pack - prepacked hospital labor bag 2nd ed.,"My husband gave me this as a surprise gift before we had the baby. His thoughtfulness brought me to tears. This is a terrific pack of goodies to take to the hospital. The shampoo, conditioner and body wash smell delightful! No, I didn't use it all at the hospital but I did use it eventually. What a great idea!! Every guy should get this for his expectant lady.",5
Tupperware Limited Edition Red Shape O Ball with White Pieces,Love the red and white version.  This tupperware toy has more shapes for a child to learn than many other &#34;shape&#34; toys,5
"Stork Craft Custom Tuscany Cherry Finish Glider and Ottoman with Free lower lumbar pillow, Beige Cushions","I love the rocker part, but the foam fizzled with only a few uses. Beware if you aren't 100 lbs. LOL.",3
P's &amp; Q's Chewy Tube Orange,"I rated the toy's ""fun"" value low since my two-year old son never every played with them or chewed on them...in fact neither did my one-year old. However, I have heard wonderful things about them from other parents whose children are biters or have other sensory issues. The are very sturdy and durable, so I can see how they'd be wonderful items to chew on. Just didn't work for my kids.Sept 2013 update: Getting daily use now! Since my son was still having major chewing and concentration issues at school, we put the ""P"" on a lanyard that he wears around his neck. He can grab it whenever he wants it and still have both hands free. Has dramatically increased his focus on his preschool work. 5 stars for us now",5
"NUK Learner Cup BPA Free Silicone Spout, Single Pack, Colors May Vary",I wish there was a way you could pick the color you want or be a neutral color.  Why would the company send out red one with flowers on it? Do they think everyone is ordering for a girl? I won't buy this product until they tell you what color it will be or that you can pick your own color.,2
Sassy Bathtime Pals Squirt and Float Toys,loved it.my nephew loves his tub toys and he is chewing on everything and he started to chew on these also so it worked out good both ways he can chew and play with them at the same time,4
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","This swing is gorgeous and amazing! My son sleeps in it for hours at a time. It has a soft feel and I love that it plus into the wall versus those swings that utilize batteries. Overall, I give this swing 5 stars!",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",This is perfect for toddlers and easy to use. Nice thing is it can be used for several years because of the 3 in 1 features.,5
"One Grace Place Infant Set, Teyo's Tires, 3 Piece",Love items and look great in the room. Having a lot of fun decorating. Kinda wish I was having more kids to use again,5
Microplush Crib Sheets (2) Mint Green and White with Moon and Stars,A bit on the pricey side. But my son loves how soft they are and it's nice in the winter not having to put him to bed on cold cotton sheets. They've been through several washings and they're just as soft as new and no pilling or shrinking.,4
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green",My kid loves to sit now and this high chair is perfect.  She sit and plays comfortably with the orange insert!,5
"Prince Lionheart Corner Guards, Chocolate Brown","Our chocolate brown corner guards aren't a perfect match for our dark brown Pottery Barn furniture, but they are pretty close and don't stand out too much.  They are super easy to install (just a apply little double-sided 3M adhesive that comes with the guards), and the hold seems to be strong.  Haven't had any need to remove them, so no comment on ease of that or whether they leave marks, but the instructions claim that marks should be removable with vegetable oil or furniture cleaner in most cases.ADDENDUM: While initially very happy with these corner guards, I have to downgrade them slightly after about 6 weeks of use.  Our one-year old was able to rip them off without a lot of trouble.  I now know why the package comes with extra adhesives.  We'll probably have to reapply every few months.  On the bright side, when she ripped off the guard, there was no damage to the furniture.",3
Gerber Graduates Whole Grain Cereal Bars 24 Pack,"This cereal bar is a great snack for on the go tots (i.e. ones that don't stay still)! They grab them and are off again while munching on something yummy. They are also easy on the go, just throw one in your purse/diaper bag grab a sippy cup and you're off.",5
Delta Children's Products Haven Changing Table in Cherry,"not as big as i thought, couldnt find any sheets that would fit the bed. with toddlers in the home it was hard keeping the items on its shelves from staying off the floor. would have liked some types of cabinets or something to keep little hands off. overall worked well and did its purpose for ages newborn to 15months.",3
"Nickelodeon 3 Piece Toddler Set, Bubble Guppies That's Silly","We set this up in a different room (as a surprise) and let my daughter walk in. The smile and giggle that she let out was well worth the initial purchase. However, since that day she has sat in the chair or couch almost every day and likes to read books. I will sit next to her on the floor and she will let me read to her. The material is soft and the product seems pretty durable. She climbs on it, has walked on it and it's still holding strong. Well worth the time and enjoyment we have received from it. Any child that likes Bubble Guppies will surely like this toddler set.",5
Safety 1st 2 Count Side By Side Cabinet Lock,"And that is what makes them great.  We use them in the kitchen and have been using them for months now.  Our kid has broken most other locks but continues to be eluded by these, which is exactly how we like it.",5
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,This is such a practical lock that doesn't take up space or cause me extra concern. The device is easy to install and worry free afterwards.If you decide to move you can take them with you no problem. The room for opening is ever so tiny I highly doubt you will have anything to worry about. My daughter has tried to open and no matter what just can't.The only thing I don't like is the lack of packs of 4. I have to order two of these already.,5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I can fit it in my Mazda 5, my kids love sitting in it, the only small complaint I have is that the back seat moves around when my kid is sitting on it. I wish it locked into place but I love the fact that it does move out of the way to get into the storage basket. This stroller turns way better than the other sit and stand I owned. It is heavy but I think it  was half the price of the joovy ultralight, and I'm used to carrying kids around so I can handle lifting it into the car. I have no regrets buying this stroller, it's a good stroller to own.",5
Baby Jogger City Select HyChair,"We love this thing.  Not only is it good for younger kids that can't quite sit up on their own yet, but when you're in a restaurant you can have your own clean seat for your child instead of a cruddy public one.  The downside is that it doesn't fit for tables that have a tall lip, but it works so well on any other table I am still going to give it 5 stars.",5
"Dandelion Organic Canvas Tote, Keep It Green","Loved this product, I use it for work.  I work in a hospital and it carries my files as well as my lunch.  Very well made, lots of pockets.  Great buy.",5
LeapFrog Baby Lilypad Vibrating Teether,"I purchased this product,LeapFrog Baby Lilypad Vibrating Teetherfor my grandaughter. When my daughter told me it didn't vibrate I ordered a replacement, same problem. In order to get the teether to vibrate I had to bend and hold the green pad at an angle to the clear plastic biting part, even then the vibration was only momentary. No baby would ever be able to make the teether vibrate. I eventually had it replaced with another Sassy Vibrating Teether, Buzz'n Bite Gentle Vibration Teether (BPA-free) which works well, it takes just a tiny flexing of the bee's wing to make the teether vibrate and the vibration continues as long as it is flexed. I think my baby grandaughter will enjoy this teether.",1
Julius &amp; Friends Monkey Twin Size Comforter Kids Paul Frank Bedding,"My 8 year old son has a thing for MONKEY'S and when we saw this at Target, it was only for a full size and he was so bummed out. So once again, my search went to Amazon and BAM. Here it was.I love this blanket and wish my comforter was this comfy!It's light on your body, yet so warm!I forgot to mention it is sooooo FUN to look at :)",5
"Evenflo Position and Lock Wood Gate, Tan",Noticed a crack on the left vertical wooden piece. Still seems capable of holding back our 11 month old but I recommend better packaging for shipment.,3
Engine 27 Fitted Sheet by Nojo,"Our 3 yr. old grandson is moving from crib to toddler bed but using the crib's mattress. I was unable to find suitable crib sheets in my local retail stores, they either no longer carry crib sheets or the patterns were to &#34;babyish&#34;. These were the perfect solution. Good quality and wash well.",4
"Summer Infant All-in-One Potty Seat and Step Stool, Pink",this potty is really cute and simple... i would highly recommend this potty! at only $12 this is a steal!,5
"American Baby Company ZZ Crib Rail Cover, Pink","This product is great and does what it says.  My son, who is 6 months old currently, may not be standing in his crib yet, but i do want to be prepared.  Unfortunately, with all of the furniture on the market being manufactured in China lately, I don't want my son to start chewing on his crib rails when he finally does get that age.  The last thing I want him ingesting are Chinese chemicals.  This crib rail cover will help keep his little mouth off of the wood rails.The grey dot fabric is very neutral, which I like.  The one thing I wish it had were some loops to attach some teething toys.",5
Baby Einstein Stack and Discover Blocks,"My baby girl loves this toy.  We get to talk about what is on each block, describing the colors and images.  The red block with the crinkle sound is her favorite one.",5
"Munchkin Fun Ice Teether Babies, Styles and Colors May Vary",My grandson loved this teether when he first got it but doesn't use it much anymore.,4
"Leachco Prop 'R Shopper Body Fit Shopping Cart Cover, Pink Forest Frolics",Perfect! If you have a special needs child with low muscle tone (and weak trunk control) this cart cover is a good buy.,5
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free Decorated Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology, 3-Pack",Born Free are the only bottles my son will use.All of the pieces wash easily and are super durable!,5
Maple Teethers,"Love these! They are made of soft maple wood. My 5-month-old likes them too. They are light and easy to hold. No BPAs or BPBs, just pure nature! I wish there was more toys and teethers on the market like these!",5
"Munchkin Quick Install 26&quot; Gate, Black","This is a simple pressure mounted gate. We live in a rental, and so wanted to avoid gates that required screws into the wall. Another benefit of a pressure mounted gate is that it is easy to move from one location to another.The gate is easy-to-use gate, and while I was skeptical of the black webbing (versus the white webbing I remember from my childhood), it really does make the gate barely noticeable in our living room. (I definitely don't sit on the couch thinking &#34;oh, there's a gate over there.)I wanted a safe, simple gate that came without a big price-tag (the gate at our local toy store is $60!), and this one worked out so well that I am ordering another.",5
"OXO Tot Sippy Cup with Bonus Training Lid Set, Green, 7 Ounce","This is one of the first awful OXO products we own.  Sippy cups are bound to fall on the floor and every single time this one falls, the valve pops out and water goes everywhere.  The mouth piece seems quite large too and our baby just does not like this cup. Don't waste your money. We thought we'd give this cup a chance since almost all our kitchen utensils are OXO, but Playtex cups are so much better.",1
PlayTray for the Stokke Tripp Trapp  - Transparent,I purchased the PlayTray after a few frustrating months of cleaning up our daughter's mealtime messes. I love my Tripp Trapp highchair and I'm so pleased that I now have a tray to help minimize the mess. The tray has a nice wide rim and it is made from sturdy plastic. The only negative comment I have regarding the PlayTray is its exaggerated cost.,4
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","This is definitely the best tub.  One side for infants and switch to the other side for older kids.  I had the 4-stage bath first and got rid of it in exchange for this one.  Big enough for babies to splash around, but snug around their bodies to keep them supported.  I can never pull my 3-month old out of the tub!",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I bought this to keep at my mother in laws house for my son because we are over to see her quite often. I didn't want to buy a high chair to keep at her house because of the cost and it would just take up too much space so I did some research and came across this and decided to try it out. I am absolutely pleased with this seat, it's very easy to keep clean, affordable, fits to all different types of chairs, and comfortable.We keep this at granny's house and it's very easy for her to store and it's so light that she can handle it well.This is a wonderful product and I don't know what we would have done without it!!!",5
"Boppy Noggin NEST Head Support, Denim",The first day I received this I used it. I noticed after only a few hours a difference. It has been 3 days now of using it everywhere except to put my son to sleep. His head is getting round again horray. The best thing ive gotton so far. I will be recommeding it to all of my expecting friends!!,5
"C.R. Gibson First Year Calendar, Alex",Love this calendar! It matches my little ones baby book and I can write things in the calendar and transfer them to her book later when I have more time! Price was great too!,5
Taggies Oodles Owl Plush Rattle,"I paid $7.99 for this, for my niece, whose mother is obsessed with owls and has the entire nursery done in pink owls. I was a little disappointed by the size of this toy when I received it. Thank goodness I paid what i paid and not any more.",3
"Safety 1st Deluxe Press Fit Outlet Plugs, 8-Count","I bought these b/c I felt the old style were too easy to pull out.  I cannot express how much I HATE these.  I didn't want my toddler to see me pressing the buttons and figuring out how to remove them.  No fear, though... I couldn't even get them off myself, despite practice and pushing the buttons in the directions.  I had to wait until he went for a nap and pry them off with a screwdriver!  These are garbage and since I didn't actually get them from amazon, I can't return them.  I'm putting them in the outlets that I don't use that much.",1
Fisher-Price My Little Snugabunny Newborn Rock n' Play Sleeper,"We got this because it was highly recommended and I couldn't be more pleased.  Our large (10.5 lb.) baby loved it from day 1. He has reflux as well as IBS (although or pediatrician told us it was ""colic""). Our little guy would not have been able to sleep without this. This works well as a bassinet beside the bed and is light enough to move into the bathroom when mom needs a shower. I've read things about babies getting deformed heads and the parents blame it on this. I'm not a doctor, but I'm willing to bet if you leave your baby for extended periods of time on any hard surface they could get a flat spot on their head. Our little guy has slept 8-10 hours a night in this without incident. Also the Snuggabunny cover washes well. The SnuggaMonkey has since come out and I would love to have had that cute pattern!",5
Custom Fit KidCo Configure Gate - White,"I love this gate.  We live in a town house, and the wall next to our staircase doesn't have any studs in it, and the stairs would move from a pressured gate.  The front door is also located in front of the stairs, so we wanted a gate that would block access to the stairs, and also block the front door so I wouldn't have to worry about my son getting in front of the door incase daddy walked in.  It is very sturdy and strong.  It is much stronger when you have the gate curved rather then straight.  I would highly recommend this gate for anyone stuck in a fickle with dimensions.",5
Hevea Panda Teether,My 3 month old loves it! She can hold onto it fairly well and likes to chew on the little bears feet!,5
bumGenius One-Size Snap Closure Cloth Diaper 4.0 - Bubble,"When my first daughter was born we tried cloth diapers from a diaper service and they were terrible! They leaked, they stunk, they were bulky and hard to use. So we ended up using disposables. When our second daughter was born we thought that we'd stick with disposables. That is until we noticed how much garbage we were creating (a big black garbage bag of diapers a week!)not only that but they were incredibly expensive. So we decided to try cloth again. This Time I did some research and came across these. After reading the reviews and consulting some cloth diapering parents we know, we decided to buy some.I was really nervous the first time I used them (not wanting to relive the last cloth diaper experience), but I am overjoyed to say that these are amazing! I'm pretty sure that everything has already been said about them, but I will say this:The first time I used one it leaked, but after changing to the thicker insert and putting them on a little tighter I have not had a single leak!(their website FAQ section is very helpful and worth a read) I am also astonished at how well the lining fabric wick's the moisture away from my babies' bum. Sometimes it is hard to tell if she has gone because the lining will be dry, but then when I open it up the insert is soaked. Amazing! Also one last thing, my daughter had a really stubborn yeast rash for about three weeks, I tried everything to get rid of it and nothing worked. As soon as I switched to cloth the rash cleared in a day.I would recommend these to anyone and everyone! They are fantastic. I actually enjoy changing diapers now. We also bought some of the Fuzzibunz One Size and they are equally fantastic.",5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I had read reviews and gotten interested in this product while pregnant, then had my baby four weeks early. She has been fairly fussy, and I had tried my mom's old snuggli baby carrier, but with a birth weight just over 4 pounds, the carrier was just huge on her. I decided to go ahead and buy this product off of our registry, since we had not yet received it as a gift. I so wish we had made the purchase within that first week or two of her birth, rather than waiting until she was five weeks old.She slept fabulously as soon as I put it on, and then had two of her longest stretches between feedings. I skimmed the instruction manual before putting it on--but the wrapping and putting baby in the carrier was so much easier than I had anticipated. I had it on for the first time, and had my baby in it, within less than ten minutes! Within just a few hours of having it, my husband said it was definitely worth it. He has not yet used the moby wrap, but is looking forward to trying it out sometime soon. I love holding my baby so securely, and also having the option of being hands-free to do some household chores as well!I would have given five stars except for the cost (fairly high for basically a long length of knit fabric), although I have to acknowledge that the instruction manual and knowledge of how to wrap is worth something in itself.I love the moss color--very pretty, and great for boys or girls!",4
"Dena Happi Tree Rug, Pink","Cute, but really poorly made. It came out of the package kind of damaged but I had no energy to return it. Pretty small. Don't expect too much.",2
"Dream On Me / Mia Moda Compagno Stroller, Mint Java","This stroller had all the features I wanted, except the color....The wrong color was sent and I was told (not by Amazon, but by the seller), that they could not send me the color I ordered, so I returned this item and purchased another stroller else where.",4
"Bummis Super Brite Diaper Cover, Pink, 8-16 Pounds","Always loved Thirsties but this cover won me over. Doesn't stain easily, hold messes in, easy to put on, fits great, super cute. Can't wait to pick up a few more.",5
"Vital Baby First Stainless Steel Cutlery Set, Blue",Based on teamelon's review we purchased these.  Very happy with this purchase!  I handed my son a bowl of baby cereal and the spoon to see what he would do.  He picked it up and fed himself easily.  The handles are designed so well that they are easy for little hands to control.  We tried a Gerber spoon with a thinner handle and there was a big difference in ease of use.  We will be purchasing a few more sets for him - they are well made and should last us a few years.,5
"Kiddopotamus Dreamsie Sleeper with Sleeves Microfleece Large, Ivory","I bought the large sleepsack with sleeves for my 14 mo. son because this seemed to be the only product available with sleeves.  It says up to 24 lbs on the sizing chart.  My son is not yet 21 lbs but normal length and he can't stretch his feet in this thing. The arm length is fine though...  So I'm keeping it because it's the only product with sleeves, but I'll have to sew an extension to the bottom somehow... Not what I expected for a product claiming to be roomy at all...

"Cardinal Gates 21.75&quot; Extension for Stairway Special Gate and Auto Lock Gate, White","This was perfect to extend our gate. Even though the original gate was purchased 7 years ago, I was pleased to see the quality and craftsmanship has not changed. We had no issues installing it and it does the job well.",5
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"This is a wonderful invention.  My daughter purchased one for her 7 month old daughter who had a persistent cold.  It works so much better than the type with a bulb.  Because of its construction, it's judged to be very sanitary and you can actually see how much mucus is being extracted.  The baby appeared much more comfortable after each application and was finally able to sleep better, thus affording my daughter and son-in-law more sleep, as well.  I purchased one to keep at our home just in case the need arises during the baby's monthly sleep-over.  I heartily recommend this product!",5
Fisher Price Sit to Stand / Playzone Replacement Balls - Set of 3,"While my son loves the toy that these balls go to, it is not worth the cost.  If you include shipping the cost is around 7 or 8 bucks and we got the whole toy for 2 dollars!! I would strongly recommend that you find similar size balls that would work with the original fish price sit to stand giraffe activity center.",2

"Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Black","The  bag is like a overnite bag/hold-all and not really designed for as a diaper bag, it is too deep, so everything will get lost in there. You could probably use it for a long trip and have clothes and toys etc, but for day-day diaper bag essentials , it is too unweildy and huge.Also the item I got, the zipper was not functioning well, but that may have been a single item issue and not product issue..had to return i t..",2
Sassy A - Z Letter Links,"I purchased this as a Christmas present for my one year old and she loves them!  I can't say that ordering alphabets at this point is helping her educationally at ALL because she is only one but as we start working with her with letter and color recognition, I expect that these will become a dual purpose toy/educational tool.  Sturdy and colorful, and very cute.  Overall great purchase!",5
Britax Back Seat Mirror,This mirror is perfect for making sure our baby is safe in the back seat. I would definitely recommend it,5
"Dream On Me, 3 in 1 Portable Convertible Crib, Cherry","I bought this && expected better. I am very dissapiinted because I didn't have all of the necessary pieces to put my son crib 2gether. When packing this stuff up, you people need to pay attention to what you are doing.",1
Infantino Activity Triangle,"I gave this to my son when he was about six months old. Now nearing 11 months, he has never really taken to it. Most sides of this toy have spinners, which are all very similar. He spins them a few times, then he moves on. I've tried waiting a few weeks and bringing the toy out again for him to play with, but it's never really been a favorite toy of his. I *will* mention that the triangular shape makes it not very stable if a little one tries to put weight on it. (When my son was six months and just learning to crawl/move around, he put his weight on the toy and it flipped; he came down on a corner of it and hurt himself. Nothing major, but it is a bit of a bulky toy for a little one ... )",3
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,"I exclusively pump so storage bags are a big deal for me. I always try to buy a new brand every time I need something. Lansinoh and Nuks work great but the Medela bag is a ridged plastic that's hard to open. It only has a single seal unlike other storage bags. I lost 2 ounces last time I put some in my fridge. It's also very hard to pour into a bottle. Although I love my medela pump, I will not be using the rest of these bags and will be trying target brand next.",1
"Sassy Baby Changing Pads 36 Count Box, White","Whenever my son's even slightly damp skin touches it, it sticks to him and a piece comes off.  The waterproof backing makes this extremely slippery and won't stay in place anyway.  I've used similar products before, and while those could be used multiple times, had we wished it, these ones don't even last through one!",1
First Years Premium Single Electric Pump,"I bought this breast pump right at the birth of my son, and used it twice a day for 7 weeks.  All of a sudden, the suction no longer worked on the ""flex-shield"" attachment.  So, we took it back to BabiesRUs.  They replaced it, no charge.  The 2nd machine's ""flex-shield"" only lasted TWO DAYS before losing its suction!  I am extremely frustrated - ""The First Years"" said that they would send me another attachment for correct suction, but I'm not excited about continuing to use this machine.  We will probably return it this weekend, and get a refund.",1

Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I've been using the Diaper Dekor Plus for over a year and a half. The old bags used to work perfectly, and the product deserved 5 stars then. But with the new bio-degradable bags the nursery stinks.... I'm on the market for a new product, the Diaper Dekor is going to the trash.",1

"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot",The picture didn't match the actual product. I thought it was too good of a price for it. I ended up returning it.,3
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","I have to start off by saying that we owned a Baby Trend Expedition jogging stroller with our first child and loved it and used the heck out of it! But when we went over bumps, it would shake. After test driving a few friends' BOB strollers, I knew that as much as we used a stroller, I would be getting a BOB for baby #2. There is no comparison for the quality of a BOB and the ease of pushing compared to the Baby Trend. The Bob is like a Cadillac! It's amazing! Easy to fold up, goes off road great and doesn't shake when going over slightly uneven ground. So with that being said, I have to point out some things I'm dissappointed with that I feel the Baby Trend had that the BOB doesn't. For the price, I wish the BOB had a built in cup holder/glove compartment for parent. You can purchase a canvas cup holder which is fine but I wish it was a built in hard plastic one like my Baby Trend one so that my drinks didn't flop around. I also wish that there was a built in snack tray/cup holder for baby. Again, I purchased one separately but it seems so high that my 10 month old can't reach it and it also has to be removed when I fold up my stroller. What a pain! My Baby Trend stroller tray was at a perfect height for my daughter to reach. Lastly, the BOB just does not seem as comfortable for baby. The seat seems to lean too far back and I can't get it upright high enough. It is also not meant for bigger kids. When the sunshade is folded all the way back, my 10 month old son hits his head on it because there isn't enough height in the stroller. And forget my 5 year old sitting in it. I do have to say it still strolls pretty nicely with her sitting on the front foot rest while my son is in the seat. Ok, I said I was done but one more thing. I wish the sunshade went in 2 directions like the Baby Trend did. All in all, I love my BOB and I would not go back to the Baby Trend! I just felt these points could help someone on the fence because there's a huge price difference between strollers.",4
Under The Nile Green Bean Toy,These are great toys and just too cute.  My older boys like to use them as puppets for my younger one who giggles the whole time.  They have withstood the abuse so far.A nice chewable soft toy.,5

"NUK Disney Winnie the Pooh 5 Ounces Learner Cup Silicone Spout, 6+ Months","I bought a variety of handled sippy cups for babies for my son who has a hard time holding a bottle.  This cup is nice, a great neutral design,  and I like that it is a smaller 5oz size that he can hold well.  Unfortunately, he gets frustrated at the flow of liquid.  This cup takes a lot of sucking and he is not quite as physically strong as similar aged children.  I tried using it to see how much liquid came out and found myself getting tired of sucking.  It's definitely leak proof because it is so hard to suck out the liquid!",3
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"The ""genie"" is flawed in many ways.  The basic answer is this product doesn't really work.  Smells still leak out, diapers don't seal into their sausage rolls consistently, and the cutting blades quickly become dull causing your little poop sausages to unroll as you try to cut the bag to throw the darn thing away!  It's a finicky contraption that only works like it's supposed to about 10% of the time.  It's made of plastic which absorbs odors so even after you empty it, it still smells like poop.  We were buying a new refill about every 5 days.  I got tired of spending $25-$30 a month on trash bags that didn't work.Don't waste your money on buying any diaper ""system.""  Any time you have poop in a container inside your house, it will smell.  There is no way to prevent odors from leaking out.  And the longer those diapers sit, the more they ferment.  Think about it.  If you took the lid off a trash can in your house and did your business in it, put the lid back on and left it for a few days, how do you think it would smell?  Why do you think bathrooms have exhaust fans?What we do in our house is have a small trash can that clips to the side of the changing table.  We bought it at IKEA for about $5.  Walmart sells 4-gallon vanilla scented trash bags in rolls of 100 for $4.  Every time (and I mean every time) we have a poopy diaper, the trash bag gets tied up and thrown in the trash can outside.  Our daughter is old enough now that she carries the trash to the door for us.  I then pick her up and we go outside and drop the bag in the trash can.  The diaper trash gets taken out once or twice a day, and the bag only costs about $.04.  We spend much more per diapers.  The house has never smelled of diapers since we started doing this 9 months ago!  I sold our ""genie"" on ebay for $20.",1
"PRIMO Folding Potty with Handles, White granite","We've used this quite a few times at public park restrooms (that look like they were last cleaned in 1988) and while were traveling with our small child. It's very simple to use - you literally unfold the folding potty seat and sit the seat on top of the toilet seat. That way your child's bottom is touching the folding seat and not the gross toilet. The handles on the sides are a godsend because then they're holding onto the seat rather than touching the toilet.I used to keep it in my diaper bag or backpack in a clean grocery bag. Once it got used, I put it back into the grocery bag and when I got home I wiped it down with Clorox or Lysol wipes on both sides and then put it into a NEW bag so it was ready to use again.Despite your best efforts, at least they will be able to go to the bathroom in a clean manner. However, if your child is like mine I pretty much guarantee they will still touch the floor of the restroom, the door, look under the stall at the next person, and get a dubious amount of soap on their hands while washing them. :-). Hey, at least we try to keep them healthy.",5
Baby Einstein: Caterpillar Cooling Water-Filled Teether - colors may vary,"I am surprised by the other reviews stating that this teething ring had a smell.  Maybe there was just a bad batch or two because the one I have never smelled at all.  Also, I have had it for a long time now and it has not chipped like one unfortunate reviewers has.  It is cute and colorful and catches baby's eye.  However, my kids have never really been big fans of teething rings or toys and this one was no exception.  My kids liked holding it when it was cold (having put it in the freezer etc.) but once it was no longer cool the excitement of it was gone.",4
Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System Complete,,1
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"We purchased this and have been using on and off for a couple weeks.  On and off due to the fact that it pretty much blitzes my wireless reception between the front and rear of my condo... baby's room lies between the router and my computer, as does do a few walls and a closet... but without the baby monitor, all is fine. Additionally the audio is just OK, no great. Does not always clip in on noises made. We happen to that a baby that chatters quite a bit, so maybe that is a problem.",2
Kate Spade Signature Spade Quilted Bon Shopper Diaper Bag/ Tote Bag (Multi-color) #PXRU3826,Bright and fun diaper bag with plenty of pockets for the mom on the go!  I love Kate Spade baby bags as they are fashionable and can be used long after your baby has grown.,5
"Jeep Adventure Jogging Stroller, Black","I took my 1.5yo daughter for a walk as soon as I got it together yesterday & it did great.. Then this morning I went to break it in with a jog & I noticed that one of the rear wheels' frames was bent so it wobbled during warm up (brisk walk).  I started jogging and within 30 seconds the front wheel started shaking uncontrollably and came to an abrupt halt while my daughter cried from being jostled around in what was supposed to be a good quality, safe RUNNING stroller.  As soon as we got home I called the company & found out that they don't have a call center, they only work Mon-Fri.  What if my daughter had been injured?!  I would not recommend this stroller to anyone who actually wants to run with it (then again, I wouldn't recommend it for daily use either since it's heavy as all h***) so I guess I wouldn't recommend it at all.  I will be returning this ASAP and going with the BOB I originally wanted.",1
"Orbelle 3-6T Toddler Bed, Natural",It's just as good as it has to be. Can't complain about anything. We cut of the legs and made beautiful montessori floor bed with just enough freedom and security,5

"The Deglingos Simply Deglingos Plush Toy, BigBos the Wolf","Well made, cute and soft. Daughter loves it quite  a bit. She's taken on a new fear of wolves (we live in a Jersey City across the Hudson from NYC.... no wolves for at least 2 hour drive in any direction... Gotta love 3 year olds). Anyway. the  goofy expression helped ease her concerns and now the good wolf (this one) keeps the bad wolf away.Enjoy!",5
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","My son was really reliant on some sort of music and movement to fall asleep. After winding the cutesy little mobile that matched his nursery countless times, I decided it was time to bite the bullet and purchase something a little more expensive that would play for longer. I saw this mobile with the ""light show"" as we call it and thought I would give it a try based on its ratings. It is now firmly on the list of my must-have baby purchases for all expectant parents. Not only does the music last for 20 minutes, but my son was mesmerized by the projection. The music is soothing and after using it for a while it became a part of his bedtime routine and a way for him to calm down right before drifting off to sleep. He is 15 months and we still use it to this day after taking of the canopy when he learned to pull himself up in the crib. I've had it for a year and have only replaced the batteries once. You won't regret this purchase!",5
"Born Free ComfortFit Body Pillow Slip Cover, Diamonds","The cotton is of a nice quality. It is a little ""crisp"", but will soften up with washings. As with all cotton, it is absorbent, which will be wonderful as the nights are getting warmer and more humid. The ties mean the coverage isn't perfect, but on the up-side, it's easy-on and easy-off.",5
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"I have a 17 month old daughter, and she absolutely adores this baby radio. I bought it because I needed more portable travel toys since we both spend so much time in the car together.The sound is much better than expected from a $10 item, and the music is great (unlike some other toys with annoying vocals and laughing). The front panel lights blink in unison with the music, and the toy is light enough so she can hold it with one hand.The button on the front starts the music. It requires a little pressure to activate, but is still very easy to push. The switch on top has two volume settings (high/low) and also turns the unit off. The only complaint is the sticker button; my daughter is a peeler and took it off after a few weeks. Note: some parents have mentioned this might be a choking hazard, especially for younger children - I thought this was worth mentioning.Aside from the ""Take Along Tunes"", some of the other must-haves for keeping my daughter occupied while traveling are:*Lamaze Cloth Book: Keeps her engaged with peek-a-boo flaps that reveal little animals underneath. I have a few other cloth books but this remains her favorite of the bunch.*Tiny Tutor DVDs: When she gets bored of her toys I play these videos for her. Very basic animations, but she has learned so much from them. Great buy.*Manhattan Toy Winkel: Amazing design, looks a little like an atom. This keeps her entertained for long periods of time. It also acts as a teething ring.*Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy: Keeps everything attached to the car seat or stroller. Much better than velcro since they don't snag on her clothes or scratch her skin.""Take Along Tunes"" is yet another winner from Baby Einstein. From their videos to their toys, you just can't go wrong with anything they make. Highly recommended!",5
Fisher Price Nesting Action Vehicles,"This is a wonderful toy that is fun, educational, and affordable! The cars are different colors, and each has a different number, 1 - 4, to help a child learn counting and colors. They also stack on top of each other and nest inside of each other.(The nesting feature is great for storage too). Each car has a neat fun feature for little ones to explore (e.g., the small car is also a rattle, the large fire truck's ladder moves, etc.) The cars are also very sturdy (as has been proven by my son repeatedly banging them together,) and they are easy for little hands to grab onto. At 6 months of age, my son really enjoys looking at the toys, passing them from one hand to the other, banging them together, and, of course, putting them in his mouth. I imagine this toy will remain one of my son's favorites as he learns to stack them and roll them on the floor. I would highly recommend this item.",5
"Munchkin 2 Pack Mighty Grip Straw Cup, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","I tried these after reading favorable reviews here after trying sippy cups with frustrating result. These are just wonderful. They have great grips perfect for little hands. The baby never dropped the cup even once unlike sippy cups.I feel these are great for transitioning from bottle, my baby got the hang of drinking from these without a hitch. I even got the baby to drink more water by giving her water in this cup. This is a winner. Unlike some reviewers, I have never had a leak even when the baby throws the cup while playing or when the cup is lying sideways.",5
Gund Baby My First Teddy Pullstring Musical - Pink,FOR OVER 20 YEARS I HAVE PURCHASED THESE ADORABLE MUSICAL ANIMALS FOR NEW MOTHERS (AND DADS).  THEY ARE PERFECT FOR HANGING ON THE DOOR KNOBS OR PUTTING ON BACK OF STROLLERS.  I USED TO GET BEAUTIFUL SONGS BUT NOW ONLY HAVE SEEN THE USUAL LULLABYE.  YOU PULL THE LEGS DOWN AND IT PLAYS MUSIC WHILE THE LEGS CURL BACK UP.  MOTHERS HAVE TOLD ME HOW MUCH THEY LOVE IT BECAUSE THEIR BABIES FALL ASLEEP TO THE SOFT MUSIC.  PLEASE READ THE WARNING NOT TO PUT SHERE BABY CAN GRAB IT... NOT FOR A TOY.  BUT PERFECT GIFT FOR A BABY SHOWER.,5
"Regalo Guardian Expandable Gate, White","The description on the website says the gate expands to 44&#34;.  I need it to expand to at least 43&#34;. It only opens to 42&#34; which is smaller than the opening I need it for.Other than that, the color is nice, it seemed very sturdy, and it's the perfect height to allow cats to jump over but keep out a toddler, while also allowing a short (5'1&#34;) mom to step over easily. If the dimensions had been accurate I would have given it 4, maybe 5 stars.",1
"Simmons Kids Beautyrest Beginnings Sleepy Whispers Ultra Deluxe 2 n 1 Crib and Toddler Mattress, Neutral","Well made, I'm confident it's a good mattress. Couldn't beat the price- living in Alaska this same mattress is almost double.",5

"Dreambaby Pullover Bibs, 4-Count",Wonderful.,5
Playskool: Busy Chase 'N Crawl Duckies,"This is one of the baby's favorite toys.  She has been playing with her duckies during tummy time since she was three months old.  She loves reaching out and spinning the ducks.  She also enjoys watching the ducks revolve as an adult pushes the toy.  The two side features -- the duck face with open-and-shut sliders eyes and the clicking purple dial -- are designed for significantly older children (the up on the six months and up age designation) and of no interest to her.Other reviewers raised some concerns about children getting their hands caught between the ducks, so although we've never had a problem, as with everything else, it is probably a good idea to supervise small children.",5
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","We replaced a baby gate that we didn't like with this one, and I'm so glad we did. This one has a ""stay open"" feature that I LOVE, doesn't wreck your walls with nails, and is much easier to open than the previous gate we had. I also like the look of this one better than other gates, as it is more curved and therefore looks less like a ""prison"". Very pleased.",5
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet",I don't think there is a better mobile. The projection makes my baby amazed with his wide open when we play it for him. Finally we can put him down and something will entertain him instead of us having to carry him all the time. The more he grows the more he sees the animals and the happier he is.I gave it a 4 not a 5 bec the heart beat music and the nature sounds are not really fun. So we only have the classical music to use. But it is a def buy product.And btw.. it takes big expensive batteries. We were worried but we have been using it for over a month and we did not need to replace the batter yet and we open it daily for him for at least 20 min.,4

"Vital Baby Baby's 1st Feeding Set, Pink","We have two of these bowls. It is perfect for eating meals on the go. I love having the spoon in the lid. I have used it in the microwave, refrigerator, and microwave sterilizer. I love that I can make up my son's meal the day before and have them stacked in the fridge ready to eat. The spoons have flexible tips that make feeding my 9-month-old son easy. I have tried several other types of bowls (some of which worked well at the early stages of solid food feeding), but I highly recommend these because they are so versatile.",5
"NUK Hello Kitty Silicone Spout Learner Cup, 5 Ounce","This cup has a cute design, is easy to clean in the dish washer basket, and baby likes drinking from it.My 7 month old took to this soft spout right away and the handles make it easier for her to try and feed herself.",4

"Philips AVENT ISIS iQ Uno Electric Breast Pump, White","My wife loves it!!!!This pump takes the labor out of the manual pump. If you follow the instructions step by step and ensure you get a good seal ,it will work like a charm. Also, you can interchange the components and use it as a manual pump. I wish I would of bought this product first before I bought the manual one. I could of saved money. The only difference between the manual and this one, is the pump/motor, everything else is the same. Remember read the instructions and assemble correctly and it will work with excellent results.",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"We registered for this monitor on our Amazon registry.  We felt considering the reviews and the price this would be a good fit for us. It has served it's purpose for the last year, but considering you can buy nicer monitors with more features for the same amount of money, I regret getting this one.  First I can't tell you how many times I wish I could communicate remotely. Second, there are times I wish I could zoom in to get a better view of DS.  Both are made out of not very durable plastic. The camera fell off the shelf and broke.  We had to rig it with some rubber bands and hang it upside down from the base.  Then the antenna broke, so the signal cuts in and out all the time, which is especially annoying with all the beeping at night.",3

I read the reviews and thought that it seemed like a good product (if you got one that worked).  So ordered my first one and it didn't work, ordered another and it didn't work either.  Needless to say I am returning the second one and not ordering anymore.  I am not sure why Muchkin continues to put out a defective product, it will make me think twice about purchasing their products again.",1

Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,"Baby has not arrived yet, but this seems to be exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something to put on the dresser so we could change the baby at waist level. There is some ""traction"" on the underside of this mat so it won't slip off. Plus, we're not planning to leave the baby on the dresser by himself anyway so we're not concerned it's a safety hazard! There is a belt attached to this pad also. I bought the Summer brand pad cover (with the monkey on it) which works great with it.",5

"Adiri BPA Free Natural Nurser Ultimate Bottle Stage 1 White, Slow Flow (0-3 months)","These bottles are just ok.  My baby is breastfeed and at 9 weeks she decided that she didn't like the bottle, so we purchased the Adiri bottles hoping it would simulate the breast.  The plastic is too hard and since the breast is soft and palateable, my daughter didn't like it.  For some reason she doesn't suck with just her lips, but wants to put her entire mouth over the bottle and because these are too hard, she didn't like it.  Plus they're really expensive.  If your baby can suck good, these may work.",3
"Cosco Juvenile High Back Booster Car Seat, Parker",At 15 months i personally thought my daughter was a lil too small to be in this seat. its a lil harder compared to her previous seat and no recline or at least a lil head rest contour for her to fall asleep on long trips.. try sleeping sitting up straight lol... but for the price and what have you that's about all the complaint i have.. it's still a good deal otherwise considering the price.,4

"Evenflo SecureKid LX Booster Car Seat, Kohl","If you are looking for a forward facing car seat, look no further.Buy this seat.  I have four kids. I've been through a LOT of car seats. This is my favorite seat of all time. The reason? The magical latch system.  Instead of fishing around for the hooks, and then pulling and pulling until the seat gets tight, you simply click these huge, easy to manipulate latch connectors onto the hook in your car and then push down on the seat until it is tight. They ratchet themselves!Then just hook up the top tether, and you're good to go. The entire installation process takes 1 minute. Tops.Now, of course this magical latch only works if you're child is within the latch limit of your car, so you can't use it forever, but it is magical while you can.Other than that, this seat is just a really solid seat. It has decent strap height limits so you'll be able to use it in harness mode for quite a long time, and is narrow enough for three across seating.  The headrest has EPS foam for extra head protection, and the entire cover is removable for easy cleaning.I originally bought this for an extra seat in my mom's car, and ended up taking it for myself because I loved it so much.  I highly recommend this seat for your child after they've outgrown their rear facing car seat.",5

Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears - Denim,"I think the idea behind the sling is great but it is not for every baby.  Everytime our son is put in this he crys or screams.  He is an easy going fellow but he hasn't liked being held to closely.  He wants his freedom and this doesn't give much freedom to a newborn.  Also, the &quot;training&quot; video is more of a promotional advertisement.  I had to go to the web site to get more information about how to use it.",1
"The Mommy Hook, Black with Black Pad",I love this hook.  It stays connected to my stroller and comes in handy with every store and mall trip,5
"GroVia Snap Diaper Shell System, Kiwi","Pros - Very trim fitting cloth diaper. All in one style, so no stuffing of pockets! Super soft material on the outside, and soft organic cotton on the inside. Comes with extra snap on doubler. One size style with snap rise.Cons - Baby feels more wetness versus suede cloth or fleece. Must be washed on warm - this is an issue for me since I have a sanitize cycle on my high efficiency washer that uses hot water to wash. I dislike washing these separate from my bum genius and fuzzibunz diapers. Can't be line dried because they feel stiff, and take forever to dry.Would I recommend??? Yes! These are great diapers. They probably are my favorite diapers in my stash, but I don't have that many of them.",5
Baby Einstein Bendy Ball,HE LOVES THIS TOY BUT AT ONE YEAR OLD HE USES IT AS A WEAPON. WE ARE ALL TIRED OF GETTING CLUNKED IN THE HEAD; BUT IT SERVES THE PURPOSE. IT KEEPS HIM BUSY!,5
"Britax Boulevard G4 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","We replaced our britax roundabout with this one.  The fabric is great, the install great--as usual, britax does it right.  However, we have twins, one is a lot bigger than the other and this seat fit one just perfect.  The other one, with MULTIPLE adjustments just DIDN&#34;T fit, and he HATED the headrest (he has a bigger head than most his age).  Overall, I would recommend this seat for a smaller child to grow with, not retro-fit a toddler with it if they aren't used to the headrest support.",2
"KidsEmbrace Combination Toddler/Booster Car Seat, SpongeBob Square Pants",I loved it my daughter loved it best gift for her by far! Glad I got it for her l,5
"Waterproof Baby Bibs with Snaps for Girls &amp; Boys, Gift Box 10 Pack, Solid Colors","These are the bibs of choice for feeding time, but when we take the adorable twin girls out into public we wear something else. I just wish they came in soft colors for girls. They are great for feeding though, large and waterproof!",4
123 Sesame Street Soft Potty Seat,"Item is cute with all of the Sesame Street characters but the wrapping was torn and it was missing a hook which allows one to hang it somewhere, not resting on the floor.  It was returned.",3
"Boon Flair Pedestal Highchair with Pneumatic Lift,White/Orang",I love boon products! This chair is amazing. Easy to put together and take apart with a little practice. Its well worth the money. I love that it fits both my bar top table and my dinning table. The wheels are perfect for my flooring and the brake is easy to use. Its simple to clean with a nice wipe down. I've had many parents talk about it while over and how they love it much more than their cloth one. We are very happy that we went with this boon hair over some of the other easy to clean ones. It fits out family needs perfectly.,5
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,"Bought several of these to keep my pets out of various rooms in my house.  The gate works great and because it has a door, it is very easy to go in and out of a room.  Would recommend this to anyone who needs a room &#34;blocked&#34; off.",5
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe Adjustable Infant Wrap, 3-Pack, Mom &amp; Baby","These are great for newborns, and tiny babies.  My only complaint at first was that the velcro is loud.  But these keep the baby really snug, and are so easy to use.  They totally eased my mind because I wasn't worried about a swaddle blanket coming undone and getting up over my son's face.When my son (9 lb, 11 oz, and 22.5 inches at birth)got bigger, these didn't work as well. He was so long, that even when he was still within the prescribed weight range his hands would pop out from the arm part of the swaddle, and start moving around and grabbing the fabric, or his parents. His legs also became too long for the sack.  Not sure if the next size up would have worked better, but I wasn't wasting my money when these were supposed to work for up to 14 pounds.When he got bigger (around 11-12 lbs), we switched to the halo swaddle sleep sack, which worked much better, but would have been too large when he was first born.",4
Safety 1st Lift Lock and Swing Gate,"Don't buy this product. If I could give this gate a negative star I could. Safety 1st products tend to be a hit or miss. They saturate the baby market but their products are poorly constructed and very cumbersome.I purchased this gate from Babies R' Us because it looked like one I had in the past with my 1st child that worked pretty well.  Unfortunately I could not say the same for this gate.  The instructions are gruelingly difficult to interpret (and I'm a pretty handy person) with poor illustrations and terrible technical writing.When I finally got it constructed I discovered that you have to have a screwdriver handy at all times if you are to reposition or even move the gate!  To adjust the width of the gate you can't simply lengthen it and secure it. You have to adjust the sliding tabs by using a screwdriver. If you unscrew the tabs to far, they fall out, the gate falls apart and it's back to the drawing board with constructing the gate all over again!If you enjoy wasting your time and money then purchase this gate. If not then save yourself the headache and look for a better brand.",1
"Thirsties 3 Pack Boys Fab Doublers Soft Cotton Velour, Ocean Blue/Meadow/White, Large","These are super soft, and awesome inserts for cloth diapers. But they can be irritating for sensitive skin babes.. beware!",4
"ERGObaby Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Natural","I like the Ergo baby carrier. I purchased this in addition to the heart 2 heart insert and used it on my son when he was 4 weeks old. After I purchased the carrier and insert I found several other carriers that appear to be comparable and had probably other options that I would have considered, such as being able to carry the baby facing outward.Pros:1. Allows for using the Ergo carrier for newborns/infants safely.2. Does not constrict baby's legs/thighs like the crotch style carriers.3. Works well once you learn how to use it properly - it takes several tries though.Cons:1. Bulky to carry around. Mine didn't come with a travel bag. Having to carry a diaper bag, the baby carseat, and other miscellaneous stuff - it would be nice if this carrier could be folded more compactly so that it wasn't so bulky. Especially if you have to use the infant insert too.2. Infant insert had to be purchased separately and I first purchased the original insert thinking it was the heart 2 heart; had to return it and lost a few bucks paying for return shipping.3. The new Heart 2 Heart Infant insert does not have good instructions on how to use it properly.4. Baby's feet feel like they are being squished and I kept worrying that he was hurt.5. It was a hassle to use the insert with carrier while out and about. Okay when you are at home or somewhere that has a good flat surface to place the insert down on, then placing the baby on it while you also have to put on the carrier itself - it takes quite a few steps to get this on when you have to use the infant insert.",4
Bright Starts Bounce Bounce Baby Activity Zone,We love this product and so do our twins. We highly recommend this product for your daily use! Great price! &#128077;&#128125;&#128077;,5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix",I purchased this seat about a month ago...so far my daughter likes it..it seems comfortable and the fact that it has a cup holder....I feel that it is a good feature for future purposes....I am hoping this car seat will last me a good while.,4
"Skip Hop Hug and Hide Activity Toy, Owl",This toy is colorful and well-made. I think of it as momma and her baby. There is lots for a baby to do with the movable wings and owlet. There are also &#34;feet&#34; that are teethers.,5
Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,"We received this suit yesterday and put our 12 week old in it last night...she slept from 10PM until 6AM IN HER CRIB!  Pardon my excitement, but that was a HUGE win for all of us!  I am hoping we get the same results going forward since we could all use the additional sleep.  An added bonus is that she looks absolutely adorable and hilarious in it (like a little staypuff marshmellow).The sizing says 12-18lbs and our daughter is just 12lbs - it was a little big on her in the neck / chest area but at least there is room for her to grow with this suit!Highly recommend this to any parent who has a baby with sleeping issues!",5
Cloud B Twilight Ladybug - Pink,"I bought this for my daughter because we moved into a new house and she was scared sleeping. This ladybug works awesome, it lights up the whole room in either (pink, green, or blue stars) and shuts off after about 45 mins on its own. She didn't sleep for a while the first night because she was too busy playing with it, but now she wont go go bed without it. Worth every penny. I just wish that it played some music as well, but other then that its a great night light for kids.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Sea Turtle","My child has to have this on every night - It is just very comforting for a child to have on while they fall to sleep...stars illuminating their bedroom ceiling, and their favorite ""sea buddy"" lit up.Not very snuggle-able with the long, hard shell, but my child insists that it stays in bed...so I guess it's snuggleable enough. The battery life is decent (changing about once every couple months.)We have the ladybug and the sea turtle...and both are very much loved.",5
Rocking Moses Basket Stand Natural,"I just got the stand last week and it took about an hour to set up. It was fairly straight-forward but my big belly was getting in the way. It looks nice and matches well with our Moses basket. I think for the price it is pretty decent. The only criticism I would have is that it would be nice if the upper plastic rods that you screw in to the top of the basket were a little easier to affix, and it would also be nice if they were slightly more adjustable. Say a few extra holes to make the 'holder' or 'ring' part of the stand a bit smaller depending on the size of your basket. Other than that, no complaints.",4
Falling Holly Holiday Letterhead,"I bought this paper to send a holiday letter to clients and it was exactly what I needed. Nice quality, and worked perfectly on my large office laser jet printer. Would recommend this paper and will use again.",5

"Safety 1st Deluxe Press Fit Outlet Plugs, 8-Count",We tried other types of plug covers. These are the only ones my grandchild could not get off. They are hard to remove. But isn't that the point?,4
BABYBJORN Cover for Baby Carrier - City Black,If you have the Baby Bjorn and live in a cold and or wet place this cover is a must.  It lets me use the BabyBjorn on days when I otherwise would not dare expose my baby to the elements and don't want to lug around a stroller.  You can even squeeze a blanket inside for extra warmth.,5
"babyletto Madison Swivel Glider, Mocha","Good size, good quality. I got the grey one and it is a great color because it goes with everything. Rocks smoothly. Needs a footstool though.",4
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"I got this as a ""hand-me-down"" that was never used and I see why. My child won't sit on it at all, she prefers a potty chair. She cries as soon as I try to put her on it, and it does NOT fit that tight on our toilet. I tried to give it away to a friend, who bought the seat and her child won't sit on it either.",2
"Baby Starters Plush Snuggle Buddy, Blue Monkey","She is so cute and so soft - a perfect gift for any little lady to carry around.  She doesn't have any buttons, etc. so she is good to give even the little ones!",5

Baby B'Air Toddler Flight Vest - Red,"This is a good idea and I considered getting one, but upon further research I found that this device is not approved by the FAA for use.  I even found mention on some airline websites strictly prohibiting the use of devices just like this.  So be aware before you buy that there is a good chance you will be told you can't use it on your flight.  Flight attendants vary on their enforcement of the rules, so you experience may vary, but knowing the rules ahead of time will have you ready.By the way, Amazon sells the only FAA approved restraint that is not an actual seat.AmSafe's CARES Child Aviation Restraint System",3
Baby Einstein Seek &amp; Discover Activity Gym,"We bought this for my son when he was about 2 months old. He would just lay in it and would be entertained for a long time, which bought me time to do housework around him, etc.  You can take the hanging pieces down and hang up other objects so that there's always variety.  I'd say he lost interest in it though at about 7 months when he learned to crawl. I bought mine used on ebay and it was worth the $35 I spent. I wouldn't spend much more than that.",4
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","It is really five star product! Compare to my other carrier , it is easier to finger out how to use it. This product use different color to different button, one can never mistake it. Also it is very comfortable, both for adult and baby. We are satisfied with it!",5
NoJo Reversible Water-Resistant High Chair Cover Pad,Was looking for a new cover for my older Graco model that is not a 5 point harness. This will fit a 5 point harness model and my traditional strap and buckle system as well. Nice quality. Slim style preferred versus the ruffled bulky cover that came with high chair.,5
"Sassy Dippin Dinner Plate Set, Colors May Vary",I bought these plates about a year ago for my now 3 year old. i have since lost 2 of the 4 plates so i am buying more. walmart stopped carrying them :  They are good plates even after a year. they stay in place my toddler is obsessed with sauces and dips so we love the dipping section on the plates. and my personal favorite is the lids. I love being able to say ok fine if you dont wanna eat ur lunch you can have it for dinner. lol. someone mentioned the lids not staying on but thats only if you overfill the plates. I would also suggest handwashing the lids so they dont warp in the dishwasher. Anyway i love them. they are a bit more expensive but well worth it as far as im concerned. Oh and you may want to cut up food BEFORE you put it on the plate. a steak knife totally leaves a mark. but even with the cut marks theyre still holding up wonderfully. i need more. lol. (I have a 3 year old an 11 month old and #3 on its way....need more plates!!),5
Philips AVENT Twin Pack Nipplette,"I just got this today so I will only do an initial review and try and post a follow-up after I've been using it a few weeks.  I have one inverted nipple as a result of moderate tissue damage caused by an infection that occurred in one of my breasts while breastfeeding, so my problem is not genetic.  It's been this way for a little over a year now.  I'm self-conscious of the fact that one is inverted and the other isn't, even though my husband doesn't care, but I thought this might be a good non-surgical fix.  I just wanted to say that so far I find it very easy to use, and I put it on under one of my regular bras and a normal-fit t-shirt and found it to be very discreet and completely unnoticeable.  It went on easily and painlessly and so far I haven't found it to be uncomfortable.  So I would say so far, so good!",4
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar",My little granddaughter loves these even tho she is 15 months old now.She calls it her binky boo.So funny too,5
"Carter's First Year Calendar, Woodland","High quality &#34;first year&#34; calendar. We bought a different brand for our first child, and it was flimsy. We got this one for our second, and it is durable and high quality. Plus, the wife thinks it's adorable.",5
Summer Infant Carter's Jungle Jill Cozy Comfort Musical Swing,Batteries die way too quickly and the music is garbly and does NOT sooth the baby...as a matter of fact it makes her cry,3
"Go Mama Go Designs Oversized Chocolate Minky with Blue Satin Trim Toddler Blanket, Chocolate/Blue",My 12 month old son took to this blanket from the first touch. Now we are taking it everywhere. I washed it only couple of times so far but it seems to hold well cold washing and hot drying.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"After using this for 3 years, I still stunned that other people still use the Diaper Genie.  I've even had other Moms tell me that they can't smell dirty diapers in my house, even with 2 kids producing them.  If anyone is having trouble, though, try:  a)  wrapping the tabs securely around the diaper; b)  using deodorant trash bags;  and c)  taking dirty diapers straight outside to the trash and using your diaper pail just for wet diapers.",5
Evenflo Whisper Connect 900Mhz Nursery Monitor,"My son is 5 months old now and for the first 4 months, the monitor worked pretty well.  We got a bit of static from time to time, but I would have given it 4 stars.  BUT...one night I woke up to reassure myself with the little green ""on"" light and saw that the monitor was not on.  Thinking it was a fluke, I turned it back on, checked the baby and went to bed.  But, over the course of a couple of weeks, it became more and more unreliable, turning off at will.  It was also hard to turn it back on.  I had to flip the switch several times before it would work. And, this is not a battery issue, since it was plugged in the entire time. I went to the Evenflo website and read the FAQs.  There's a mention of a problem with the power light going out, but nothing about the monitor itself going out.  Needless to say, we've thrown it away and have gotten a different brand.  I mentioned this to my friend with an 8 month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers - just stopped working reliably. She's bought a different monitor too.  Both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static.  I wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes.",1
Flip Toilet Seat Trainer- Blue,"This product is just as you see in the picture. Easy to clean clear blue plastic makes Toddlers confident using the potty. However it is not compatible with most toilet seat Lids, which appear to be too wide for the Flip Toilet Seat Trainer hinges to fit around. Measurements would be helpful. There is also a lip on the underside of the seat which pokes grown up sized people in the back while the child seat is flipped up. We ended up buying a new toilet seat to fit this Trainer seat, hence the two star rating.",2
"Skip Hop Hug and Hide Stroller Toy, Owl","We bought this as a shower gift and really wish we had purchased one for our child, too!  Great for 0-9 months.  The toy looks well made and would provide entertainment also while teething!  Would buy again for second baby.",5
"Munchkin Corner Bath Organizer, Pink","I bought this hoping it would hold all my daughters bath toys. It is not as big as it looks in the picture. It is small, but it would still hold some of their toys. The problem is, it won't hold any because it won't stick. We tried everything. It slips, falls or won't even suction at all. I was so frustrated! I usually don't complain, and this is the first review I have ever written. Trust me, save your money buy a cute basket or something instead to put bath toys in.",1
BOB Warm Fuzzy in White,"The Warm Fuzzy seems to do two very important things for my 16-month old daughter: 1) It makes the BOB more comfortable for her. She fits better in the stroller and lasts much longer in it now that we have the Warm Fuzzy; and 2) It also seems to keep her warmer. The canvas material of the BOB can get quite cold during the early mornings and this does a fine job of blocking out the cold.My only complaint is that it's so expensive. The BOB is already a high-ticket item and this warm fuzzy, at least in our experience, seems to be essential.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",My grandson loves this portable cot.  It is very handy and easy to set up.  The cot is not very long so will not work for very many years.  It feels like a cot so I add a sleeping bag to make it more comfortable for overnight.,4
"Delta Enterprise Liberty Toddler Bed, Black",Loved this bed. We bought this bed when my son was about 2 1/2 years old.  He is now almost 4 and still loves his bed.  He can climb easily in and out of it. Very durable.  Both of us will often lay in his bed reading bedtime stories and it holds both of our weights easily.  Love the wood color.,5
CTM&reg; Infants Elastic Clip-End 1 Inch Solid Suspenders,They are great and fit my 15 month old nephew perfectly he is gunna be so cute at my wedding,4
Bumkins Waterproof Sleeved Bib - On-The-Go,"We ordered this product among all other Bumkins bibs because it was advertised as ""lead free"", but that is not the case since on the actual packaging it states the product is ""lead safe"".Possibly the industry standards are low enough that some consumers are okay with ""just a bit of lead"", but in our case, we do not want any lead in a product used at the dinner table.  Returning product and making our own bib out of a used tent.Sorry, Bumkins, your product design in nice and the pattern is fun, but the material with lead is a no,no for us.  We don't like sending products back to Amazon and blame the seller or the company.Lead has to go, but not to dinner with us!",2
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green","My three-month-old daughter loves it! We are so glad we bought it. She likes to make it rock herself, and she's a baby who needs to be held most of the time.",5
Summer Infant Deluxe Comfort Booster- Tan,"This is a great seat for those who rather use their own booster than the dirty ones at the restaurant.It is very lightweight and easy to set up but sometimes the straps are a bit time consuming to set the right lengths for the chair.One strapped in the chair, it was pretty much immobile.Overall worth the price except for having to lug this around everywhere you go.",4
"Munchkin Sesame Street Insulated Straw Cup, 9 Ounce, Colors May Vary",I really liked this cup because it was larger than most and the no spill made it even better. Will recommend this item to friends.,5
ZPS Cute Baby Flower Cotton Cap (Pink),"It was a cute hat, however the color was not the same - I ended up with a hot pink hat and flower.",2

Bright Starts Petals and Friends Activity Gym,She has spent hours laying on the living room floor playing with all of the toys...it folds up easy and stores convinietly behind the pack n play.  Very pleased!,5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"We have had this camera and monitor for 6 months and are very pleased with this product. They are both incredibly easy to use. The picture and sound quality are great. Also, it has useful features, like white noise elimination. The sound turns off until the baby makes an audible noise. This is wonderful because it means that you don't have to listen to the constant hum of the monitor. (If the volume is turned up all the way and your baby is peacefully sleeping there is a slight hum of background noise without this feature enabled.)The set is very portable. We have packed them up and used them while staying with family.Additionally, we are beyond satifisfied with the customer service. We recently had the antenna break and the company has promised to replace the unit in 4-5 business days, no questions asked. (We are within the one year warranty.)Thank you very much for a simple, quality product.",5
"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red","I read so many reviews before I purchased this item and after receiving this I am so disappointed.  So, I am returning the item.Pros:  Very lightweight.Seems easy to maneuver.Generous size canopy (however, does not rotate)Cons:  Difficult to fold.Baby tray does not swivel to put child in, but must be taken off completely.No back support for baby.  I attempted to put my small 10 month old in this and he had no support to sit upright.The canopy is attached and not able to rotate to block sun if necessary.Basket is small.Recline seems limited.",3
"Under the Nile 12 Piece Year Round Basics Sherpa Wash Cloth, White",I uses these as wet wipes for our daughter.  We have been avoiding wipes because they seem to be harsher.  These are nice and soft.  They are a bit expensive if you consider how many you'll want around to make it between laundry days with a very young baby that's still needs changing like 14 times a day.,5
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!",I love the Aden swaddle blankets. When my son was under 6 weeks old I used these to swaddle him. These blankets are big enough even though my son is in the 90th percentile for his size. Now at 9 weeks old I use them to tuck around him in his car seat since they are breathable he doesn't get too hot. Now I give them as gifts for new moms.,5
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",Bought this for my 3-month-old... it's perfect for establishing good habits before their teeth have come in!  She loves brushing time.,5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"My 6 month old son loves this toy... he has loved it ever since he was a small baby. The only downside - I wish it were machine washable, considering the amount of time it spends in my son's mouth!",4
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","For the price, this is a great alternative to a traditional high chair. We don't have a lot of space and didn't want a large highchair taking over the kitchen. The chair is easy to attach securely and simple to use (and clean). My 6 month old isn't a great sitter yet, and he needs a rolled up towel to keep him from sliding down, so I don't recommend the chair for babies that aren't sitting well on their own. Overall though it's a great chair and I'm glad I didn't spend the money on a traditional highchair.",4
Fisher-Price: 49 MHz Sounds 'n Lights Monitor,Baby monitors use a range that gets a lot of interference and therefore you can get a lot of static.  I've used  this system at four different places as we have been visiting my family.  At every place it worked well but at every place it took a fair amount of adjusting to get a clear signal.  This was especially true at my brother's who lives in an apartment complex; all those wireless phones and TVs really can cause problems.  But with a little experimentation we got it working.  It's a great product for the price.,5
"RayShade&reg; UV Protective Stroller Shade Improves Sun Protection for Strollers, Joggers and Prams Black",I bought this shade after seeing another mom pushing a stroller with one on it.  I stopped her in the street to ask what it was because it looked so helpful!  My poor baby was unhappily squinting in the bright sun since her carseat shade is pretty much useless.  I've used this every single day since it arrived and I love it.  I can position it in several different ways depending on whether I want more shade (or darkness for sleeping) or more visibility.  It works great with our carseat attached to the stroller but I can see using this on a stroller without the carseat as well.  I can't figure out how to get it to &#34;fold up into its own pocket&#34; yet but that's not really an issue.,5
Sassy Flutterby Teether Developmental Toy,"At first glance I thought this would be a great toy for my 6-month old who loves chewing and holding items by herself. But then I realized that the wings are filled with some liquid-goo item and the plastic that contains it does not seem very thick. I pressed my nail into it and it feels like my nail could pierce through if I pushed hard enough! There is NO way that I am going to give this to my teething baby that loves to stick her sharp little budding teeth into everything as hard as she can. I have no idea what the liquid is, but it is not something I want her to swallow.That, plus the fact that other reviewes say that bits of the handle have come apart in their kids' mouths, I just don't think that this toy is safe. Sassy needs to redesign the product or tell parents that the goo will not come out. Even then, I would still not trust it. So many toys out there, why take the risk?",1
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,,5
Bummis Tot Bots Easy Fits Girl 3PK,"I love these diapers-but don't expect the color you want from the 3-pack!  I was expecting the fun bright girl colors, but I got bland purple and green (the red is a nice color).  This package doesn't save you any money, so order your Tots Bots Easy Fit (best diaper ever!) individually  to get the prints you want.",3
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","I actually bought this elsewhere but I thought it would be a lot softer fabric than it is. From the picture it looks softer. My little one hates being in her car seat at times, and I thought this might help her sleep in her seat during drives, because it would cradle her/cushion her more similar to the way she might feel in her cradle swing. But unfortunately the cushions on the sides were TOO poofy and she set there with her arms hunched up as though she couldn't move. The look on her face told me she really didn't like it. So I took it out of her seat. I did leave the head support in her car seat though which helps cushion her head. The head support is removable. I like this because the infant support that came with my car seat carrier is all one piece and I had to take it out because she no longer comfortably fits but she still needed a little cushion for her head. I think I will use the snuzzler for my jogging stroller this spring though as by then she'll be too big for her carrier but just a little small for her stroller without some extra support. Overall happy with this purchase.",4
Earlyears Roll n Swirl Ball Ramp,Our son LOVES this toy!!  He is really in to any toy that pops balls or has them go through tunnels/ramps etc.  The best part is our dog can't chew up the balls bc they are a hard clear plastic.  Yay!!,5
"BabyPlanet Endangered Species Stroller, Giant Panda","We ordered this stroller to keep at our house as we babysit our granddaughter daily.  We wanted a stroller that would fold down flater than the Graco stroller her parents have, but did not want a little umbrella stroller.  We are very impressed with the quality, size and ease of folding this stroller.  The seat recline and the foot rest adjustment are both very good and the baby is fully supported down to a full recline for easy sleep.  The wheels roll easily and are large enough to smooth out the ride.  The handles and height of the stroller are high enough that her 6 ft tall grandfather can push her with no strain from bending his back.  The sun canopy is large enough to provide good coverage for the baby.  We love this stroller and highly recommend it.",5
"Simply Good 0-24 Months Hands Free Hooded Baby Towel, Pink","Gave this as a gift to my daughter who just had a baby, & she loves it., its soft and thick., works for her. Baby Annabelle loves to cuddle.",5

RAW Natural Unrefined 1&frac14; Cones Rolling Papers 6 Pack,"These things are absolutely perfect. You could tell the package had done some traveling, but the product was by no means damaged or unusable. They just werent perfect (meanings wrinkle free). They are awesome for people who don't know how to roll well. Even if you can roll well, these are great if you are in a rush to be somewhere.",5
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx","This is really the only car seat to look at and buy. Not the cheapest you can get, but your child's safety and comfort don't come cheap. Quality of the car seat is what sold us. We now have one of these in each vehicle.",5
"North States Swing Closed Gate, Natural Wood","Great gate! Easy to install, made nicely, works well, sturdy.  Only thing is because it is for children also, it is hard to open.  You have to twist and lift up to open using 2 hands and strength.  Not a gate if you want toddlers, young children or elderly to be able to open.",4
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"DO NOT BUY THIS THING. I received it as a baby shower gift and my husband and I used it, for about two weeks. Then we pitched in the trash. It comes with a feature that you can't turn off. It will beep if it's out of range or if there is interference.Well guess what? The darn thing would beep randomly at any hour of the day or night. It did not matter what we did or how we tried to get it to work right it would just beep loudly and in a shill high pitch. My husband and I hated this thing it is a form of torture I assure you. There  are other monitors on the market that work better. Trust me and save yourself a head ache.",1
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"We've used this wipes warmer for over 6 months now and it works really well. It's been running 24x7 since mid Feb-06. We've been careful about wetting the pillow regularly and followed the manufacturers suggestion to change the pillow every 3 months I believe. That certainly keeps it going strong. Since our baby was born in winter, this warmer really helped with making sure that we didn't have to use a cold wipe to clean him. He loves it and we do to. The smiling green light is a nice touch.Update on 4-Apr-2007: The wipes warmer is still going strong. It's worked flawlessly since we got it over a year ago and has been used everyday. The only standard maintenance required was changing the pillow every 3 months or so.",5
"Juno Blu Phoenix Breast Pump Case, Celadon","I love this little case. I got my breast pump for free through my insurance and it came in a large mustard yellow bag. Not the cutest or most practical thing to lug around. I bought this bag for the actual pump, then a cute backpack for all the other accessories. It make dragging all this stuff to work much easier.",5
Lotus Travel Crib and Portable Baby Playard,"I've had this product for about a week and I'm very happy with it. I'm using in as a second crib downstairs in our townhouse. Like other reviewers said, it is very easy to put together and fold back. My 8 months old baby loves the mesh around the crib - we play peekaboo a lot. We both enjoy the zipper feature, too. My baby crawls in and out as he pleases under my supervision and I don't need to bend and pick him up as often as I do with my other crib. There was no vinyl smell when the crib arrived like some other reviews said. I've also read about the mattress being thin and uncomfortable for the baby and I have to disagree with it. The mattress is thick and soft enough for a baby to sleep on comfortably. I ordered one cotton sheet and one plush sheet from Guava - great purchase, too. I've only tried the cotton one so far since the other one is recommended from one year. The cotton sheet is soft and fits perfectly on the mattress without bending it. I cannot wait to take this crib to our upcoming 7 days long trip with RV around the south!",5
Baby Bath Tub Ring Seat New in Box By KETER - Blue Best Price,"1. If you have a tub with no-slip grip the suction cups WILL NOT STICK. My tub has a smooth bottom so the cups work well. The cups aren't perfect. Once when she was sitting in it and leaning quite a bit one of the cups started to come up from the tub. Obviously, you can't just leave your kid in the tub and walk away so it's not really an issue for us. I was watching and I pressed the side back down. Still, this is why I gave the product a 4/5.2. It took a month to get here from Israel but was worth the wait. When I contacted the seller he helped me track the package. Great customer service.3. Bath time is so much easier for me and happier for my 8 month old daughter. We started using it at 7 months. She could sit up on her own but not for long periods of time. Occasionally she would toss herself backwards and I was worried about her hurting herself in the tub. The seat was a perfect solution.",4
Combi Counterpart 2 Lightweight Tandem Stroller in Ember,"i've only had this stroller for a month or so and i'm pretty happy with it. for a double stroller it is much lighter than a lot of the huge clunkers out there. it was very easy to assemble and folds up very smoothly. it still seems big in the trunk of my little car but what can you expect...it's a double stroller. the basket below is small and sort of hard to get to but for me that doesn't really make a huge difference, i'm always carrying a diaper backpack with two kids anyway. it is hard to steer around tight corners but again...this is a double stroller. people who expect a perfect ride for under $200 are crazy.  i love the fabric, looks a lot more hip than the baby print designs but i'm sort of a wear lots of black kind of gal anyway. my toddler loves riding in the front and using the snack tray and i've been reclyning the back seat all the way and just laying my four month old in it. in retrospect, i wish i had bought a stroller that could be used with my infant car seat. this stroller is supposed to only be compatible with the combi infant car seats. i think there may be a way to make mine work but i haven't figured it out. when the baby is a little older he'll be happy sitting up anyway so it's just a few months of awkward riding. overall, i think it's a good double stroller for the price.",4
Rockin' Green Classic Rock Lavender Mint Revival 45oz,"I really like the smell of this detergent. It works well on my sons clothes and cloth diapers. However, I can't say that it really gets the urine build up out after he's worn the diapers for a a while.",4
"Dream On Me 3&quot; Foam Playard Mattress, White",This is the second mattress like this I have bought. This is a good sturdy mattress and my granddaughter sleeps very well on it. I would recommend this to every new parent.,5
"Leachco Snoogle Mini Compact Side Sleeper, Sage/White dot","I use it every night, and can't sleep without it. Helped with my sciatica. I love that you can position it in so many ways. And I am excited to be able to use it as a nursing support pillow.",5
Nojo Toddler Satin Pillow,My little guy sleeps on a nap mat at day care and it just can't be comfortable.  I sent this little pillow with his naptime blanket and he said it really helps.,5
"Fisher-Price Cradle n Swing, My Little Lamb","I had purchased a graco swing before finding the little lamb swing. The graco swing was terrible and broke within a few weeks of having it. I was really upset with paying so much for it so I returned it, then I found this swing and got a great price for it with free shipping. When we got it , it was an easy setup and my daughter loves it! It was a great purchase and I recommend it to anyone that is looking for a high quality swing!",5
"MAM 2 Pack Rock N' Roll Silicone Pacifier and Pacifier Clip, 6 Months, Colors May Vary","My son loves these pacifiers.  The cord works well too.  We didn't get the pirate theme in our pack, just rock-and-roll.",5
"Carters Easy Fit Jersey Crib Fitted Sheet, Pink","I wash these in the regular hot wash, and after 8 months they are still doing very well. The price is great too. Highly recommend.",5
American Baby Company Celery Stripe 100% Cotton Percale Crib Sheet,"Great Fit, washes great, elastic all around, 220 thread ,9&#34; deep pockets.  Great buy, fits the Colgate Classica Foam Crib Mattress.Well worth the money.  Bought 3 for my granddaughter.",5
"Sassy Baby Disposable Diaper Sacks, 200-Count",These items are perfect for sealing up puppy pads. I do longer have to fear lifting up the lid on the trash can or consider buying an expensive diaper disposal item.,5
Flatfold Diapers - 12 Pack,"These are the greatest burp cloths ever!  We used them for everything, from burping to cleaning up messes to tucking them in my bra to catch breastfeeding over-flow.  My 2 year old has been sleeping with one since he was a few months old.  Unlike other ""loveys"", these are easily washable and interchangeable, so he always has a clean one at bedtime.  Like another reviewer mentioned, the more you wash them the better they get.  I've got all my friends and my sister hooked on these too.  Definitely a must-have.",5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",I have (soon to be) 7 daughters. The youngest are age 3 and 17 months (and I'm due again in 2 months). This stroller is great. It gives my independent 3 year old the option to sit or stand and she loves it. She likes riding on the grocery cart the same way so this stroller seemed to be perfect. We liked it so much that I purchased the triple stroller from E bay (used). I'm sure we will get tons of use out of it as well. I like that it holds the carseat with no fuss and another child can still ride comfortably. I will definitely recommend this stroller to anyone with more than one child under the age of 5/6 and the triple if you have a litter like I do! It is well worth the price.,5
"PaciGrip - Universal Pacifier Holder with Clip, that is compatible with all types of pacifiers",Love these.  Bought more.,5
"Baby Jogger 2010 City Mini Double Stroller, Black/Black","I love our city mini double stroller!  I purchased this stroller when I had my second baby.  My girls are only 11 months apart so we had to have a good double stroller because my oldest was still a baby when my second was born.  I researched strollers for a long time before deciding on this and I am thrilled with this stroller.  I've had it for three years now and have 3 children now and I am still getting lots of use.  I love that it is side by side.  The front/back strollers bother me because one child is facing the back of the other child.  Not a great view in my opinion.  This stroller is no wider than a wheelchair so I've never had a hard time fitting through any doors.One thing I would like is for the seats to sit up a little straighter but I haven't found any strollers that do that.  I also think its crazy that every accessory for this stroller is sold separately and they are not cheap.  I have bought almost all of them (belly bar, 2 trays, glider for third child to stand on, cup holder for me). The only thing I've gotten a lot of use out of is the cup holder for me.  The other things at pretty useless for us.Even though I have these complaints, I am still giving this stroller 5 stars because I love it.  It's light and folds up easily.  Fit in my Rav4 easily and now my van.",5
"Graco Ipo Stroller, Spitfire","I ordered this stroller so that I could have something easy to pull in/out of my trunk.  It fits the bill.  It's also pretty sturdy for an umbrella stroller.  My son finds it very comfortable, and I love the bright and happy green fabric.  The only drawback that I see is that the canopy doesn't provide much coverage.  I keep thinking that it moves forward more and continue to prop it off. I mainly use this stroller for store/mall trips so it's not too big of a deal.  I recommend this for a small, easy to carry, easy to set up stroller.",4
Elegant Baby Tropical Blankie- Sea Horse,"This is the perfect ""cuddle size"" for my little one.  As soon as she received it, it became her new best friend.  I probably should have gotten two....",5
"Bud Mini Rubber Duck Bath Tub Toy, Love Dove","I love the Bud Mini Rubber Duck named Daisey! She is so cute and adorable! I'm an adult, and I bought her for myself.  I have never collected rubber ducks before, but when I saw how cute the Bud ducks were and all of the different fun designs, I fell in love with them.  I have read that other adults are also collecting them, and so now I don't feel quite so silly about buying them for myself.  The Daisey duck has a tiny hole in the bottom, but that doesn't worry me because I won't be putting it in the bathtub.  I put her on a table in my room.  I love the fact that the Bud ducks are phthalate-free, and I noticed that the Bud duck does not have a strong plastic odor at all.  A few minutes ago, I ordered another Bud duck called the Bud Luxury Pretty Rubber Duck.  When she arrives, I will put her next to Daisey.  I'm sure they will be very happy together! These Bud ducks would be great gifts for children as well as adults who like to collect them.  I guess I'll always be a child at heart!",5
"Britax Frontier 85 SICT Booster Seat, Cardinal","Bought it to replace the Britax Boulevard convertible car seat.This Frontier SICT is very sturdy.Use Latch and car seat belt to install: car seat not able to move an inch afterwards. Very nice. (Read the manual and pay attention to the highlighted/bold steps.)Seat cushion is soft/comfy. Harness is smooth to operate.With this new car seat, my 4 year old (44 inches tall) now sits lower than before, i.e., not so easy to hit the ceiling of the vehicle.Note:Need to recline the back of the vehicle seat further than previously in order to install this Frontier. Otherwise, there would be gap between the Frontier SICT and back of the vehicle seat.Also, the side cushion of the SICT makes the car seat very bulky. I can install this one and an infant car seat at the back, leaving the middle seat empty. But unless your car is super wide, don't think it is possible to install this SICT side by side with another car seat.",5
Summer Infant Comfy Bath Sponge,"I bought it at Target and promptly threw away my First Years bath tub.  It does mildew, but at $5 each it is cheap enough to throw away every few weeks.  I went through 2 of them in the first 4 months of my baby's life.  I love it.",5
Baby Looney Tunes Musical Mobile,"This was the last accessory needed to complete my baby's crib. It works perfectly, quality is great and the music even makes me want to sleep. This item arrived on time 3 days after I ordered it.",5
Arm &amp; Hammer 10-Piece Nursery Fresheners,"i use these fresheners everywhere- trash can, hamper, closets. I like the product, but you have to use several of them in a small space to get good results. They are inexpensive, so using several at a time is okay.",3
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,Very musical!  Keeps the baby interested with all of the lights and sounds.  It is very well worth the money.,5
"Boutique Brand New GEENNY Safari, Jungle Animals 13PCS CRIB BEDDING SET","I had been looking around for the perfect nursery set and I found it!!! We are adopting in May and are expecting a boy. I had wanted to do a safari/jungle theme that was going to be neutral and AFFORDABLE!!! There are many sets out there but you only get 4pcs for up to $200 not including purchasing the extras. Only upset is that there is only one sheet. I will have to purchase a few extra sheets that can match the set, but for starting out this is the one I would recommend to friends.",5
Paper Dolls Pillow,First the set is not being taken off the shelves and replacds with Blossoms.  It is NOT on the list of discontinued bedding patterns at BRU.  I got that straight fromteh manager who called corporate to make sure.  They have just brought in more items to coordinate with this line so it's not going anyway.This was one of those final touches that we weren't sure if we wanted to spend the money on but I'm glad we did!  I kept it in the closet until we converted our crib into the toddler bed.  I dug it out of the closet to use as a toss pillow on her daybed nad it really is a nice touch.  It makes her bed look not so plain now and it's teh perfect size for her to play with.  So it was a good purchase and great finishing touch to a wonderful pattern.,5
"EZ Reach Light Switch Extension, Puppy","Easy to install and cute. The only problem is that the puppy is a sticker and you have to put it on to cover the screw. So if you ever plan to move it, you would have to pull off the sticker which would likely make it unusable. Should come with a spare sticker I think.",4
Multicolor Wooden Kids Shaking Bell Rainbow Rattles Wood Baby Toy Musical Instrument,Bought this toy for my 7 month old. The second I took it out of the package and passed it on to her she beamed with excitement. Literally 30 seconds later I noticed that one of the bells had fallen off and she was playing with it. Not only was it small enough for her to swallow but it had a very sharp screw attached to it.Waste of money.,1
"Warmze Feeding Bottle Starter Kit, Small, 4-6 Ounce","Bought this for airplane travel as my infant DD loves her milk super warm.  I had a bad experience flying with my DS when he was an infant and the plane wasn't in the air long enough to produce really hot water and so it took FOREVER to warm a cold bottle - in the meantime he screamed his head off on a red eye flight.  NOT.FUN.As soon as we got on the plane, I placed our 8oz, Dr. Brown's bottle (with 6oz of EBM) in the sock, opened up one of the heating pads, wrapped it around the bottle and struggled to fold over the top half of the sock over the heating pad (the elastic is super tight).  I couldn't imagine using this on a large neck bottle (we used to use the Avent bottles with my DS). I ended up ripping apart the elastic, which ended up working a lot better for me anyways.The milk took probably about 40 minutes to get decently warm.  When it was time to feed, I asked the flight attendant for hot water in a thermos I brought to heat it to the temperature my DD likes it at.  After she was done, I tried shoving another bottle in the sock, but ended up tearing the heating pad and a bunch of dark gray rocks started falling out.  BLAH. It's best to unwrap the heating element from the sock and then re-wrap the new bottle.  But be careful - the heating pad gets REALLY HOT on bare skin.I ended up using both heating pads on our 8 hour flight (since I ended up ripping the first one) and so I ordered a second set that thankfully came right before we had to head home.  Our flight home was the red-eye and so I stuck the bottle in the sock with the heating pad, ready for whenever my DD was ready to eat.  I checked the bottle less than 2 hours in and the milk seemed really warm (prob a little too warm) and the heating pad pretty swollen.  My DD wasn't ready to eat until we almost landed (so about 8 hrs later) and the heating pad was almost cool and the milk at room temperature.Based on what reviews I could find on this product, I wasn't expecting anything spectacular.  The product did a decent job - 4 stars because it did not last as long as it advertised (12 hrs), the sock a little challenging to use (they should add stretchier elastic or more) and the heating pad a little on the fragile side.  Overall, not bad of an alternative when you don't have access to an electric bottle warmer. I would purchase again if I planned on traveling on an airplane. I thought about taking this camping with us this summer, but I think I'm better off using my butane water boiler - would be much faster. I would highly suggest still having a thermos of hot water on you and to plan ahead and start getting your bottle warm at least 30 minutes in advance of when you think you'll need it.",4
Philips Avent iQ Bottle Warmer,"This bottle warmer leaves something to be desired. It almost always takes a second time in the warmer to heat the bottle up enough. I have not used it yet for baby food or for a frozen bottle but heating a bottle up from refrigerator temp has has not been as flawless as I was hoping when I ordered this product, especially for the price that you pay for this warmer.",2
Cloth Diaper Sprayer--styles may vary,"As many other reviewers stated, this sprayer lacks the t-valve which would allow you to use this and flush at the same time. The valve is not easy to find and can be pricey. When you add up what the valve and the sprayer cost, you may as well have bought a brand name one. The packaging it came in looked dirty and previously opened. There were no instructions.I would have returned it, but I think my husband threw it out because he was so disgusted about it. I wouldn't waste your money unless you already own a t-valve.",1
"American Baby Company Organic Embroidered Receiving Blanket, Mocha",My son uses this all the time and its real soft,5
"Vulli 2 Pack Vanilla Flavored Ring Teethe, Colors May Vary","Excellent, recieved as told. Perfect. What my niece wanted. Was a baby shower gift! would shop again here & tell others",5
Lamaze High-Contrast Discovery Shapes Activity Puzzle &amp; Crib Gallery,"Our four month old hates Tummy Time, but when we prop this toy up on the floor, she will actually stay calm and look at the different panels. She also enjoys looking at it when she is sitting propped up. This is great because it is big enough for little ones to handle.",5
"Carter's Velour Sherpa Blanket, Pink Dot",My 2.5yrs old son just transitioned to the toddler 2 at this daycare and they don't let him use his aquatopia memory foam nap map anymore. He can only bring a blanket and a pillow. As soon as I presented him this blanket he snuggle with it right away. It's super soft and thick enough for the winter times.,5
Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Bottle Newborn Feeding Set,Leaked all over my furniture and on my baby.  Painful to see because I pumped my breastmilk and placed it in these bottles...then having to see some of it wasted because of the leakage.  I like Avent bottles better.,1
Zoobies Caliel the Camel,"This is not the first Zoobie blanket pet that we purchase, but it is the only one we have that is this size. When my daughter was first born, she received a turtle Zoobie in the ""baby"" size (very sweet).  This is not a baby-sized camel. The blanket that comes out of it could easily be for an adult. It is made from a very soft material.The camel itself is pretty cute, with curly soft ""fur."" I know it is supposed to be like a pillow, but since the camel has a large hump, the pillow is a bit lumpy.  However, overall it is really cute, and different too! Certainly, it is my daughter's only stuffed camel!",4
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,"I don't use this tool as much any more now that my milk supply has regulated but initially it was a great way to start saving up milk when I started breastfeeding!  I like that the case has a spot to set it once you're done with it cause often you cannot get up right away and find a place to put it.  It's easy to wash.  It's a little bulky but I only use it when I'm feeding, I don't walk around with it in my bra.  I also thought it helped to put it on my engorged side to help release milk and my engorgement while I fed my baby on the other side.  Great invention! This was recommended in my breastfeeding class.",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","This car seat is rated as very safe.  I bought it and my daughter bought the same one.  We have both had the same problem.  The main buckle release has become increasingly harder to release, at times close to impossible.  Last night mine would not release at all.  We had to cut the seat belt off.  Quite awhile before this we realized we had to have a knife at the ready in case we were in an accident that would require getting the child out immediately.  So for $157.00 I got a car seat that lasted for 10 months.  There is a serious defect in the buckle.",1
"Mumi&amp;Bubi Solids Starter Kit, 42 x 1oz Cubes In Two Compact Baby Food Freezer Storage Trays, Plus Free e-Recipes",Purchased for my 6 mo. granddaughter. Love them. Perfect serving size and so practical. Great quality and easy to clean too.,5

"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!","These blankets are awesome. I live in Houston Texas and it is a great summer blanket because it is super lightweight and not hot.  I also like that they are large in size. Easy to swaddle. Got one as a shower gift, and ordered 3 more.",5
Britax Back Seat Mirror,"I can't imagine a better backseat mirror than this one, for any price, let alone for the price I paid for it. It snaps on in a second to the headrest. It sits on a swivel ball so you can move it to any direction (even spin it upside down) to get the perfect angle on your little one. The mirror doesn't look like a funhouse mirror. Britax definitely knows what they're doing.",5
"Dreambaby Children at Play Sign, Orange","These are easily visible from blocks away. We keep it in the middle of the street so it forces cars to slow down and drive around it. Also, we keep a stone inside so it doesn't blow away.",5
Pink and Black Sophia Baby Girls Changing Pad Cover by Sweet Jojo Designs,"I ordered the entire Sophia Crib set with the """"Changing Pad Cover"""" included.  It was delivered in a timely manner and packaged very well.",5
Carter's Diaper Bag,"I chose this bag in the first place, because it did not look like a regular diaper bag, but I was not sure of its size. Well, it is as large as a regular dipaer bag and it is very cute. I have not started using it, yet; but it does look practical.",4
Kiinde Kozii,We have taken great care not to let this run out of water and it works beautifully. We like the ticking which we can hear all thru the house and it transported well until we bought the Tomme Tippee thermos bottle warmer for Grandma sitting.,5
"Lamaze Learn to Dress Activity Doll, Cowgirl Carly","arrived quickly and is perfect.  My niece is 15 months and very interested I'm zippers, some of the things on the toy are still to difficult for her, but is good that she won't out grow it soon.  She really liked the brought colors too.",5
Bumkins Organic Cotton Washcloth 3-Pack - Dusty Blue,"Super soft and fluffy, even after many washes.  I love that they are organic too.  I bought the 6-pack and did not experience any problems with the quality of any of them.",5

Philips AVENT 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer,"This product is just great. It is wonderful to know that you can sterilize baby's accessories like the feeding bottles, nipple shields, breast pump accessories, pacifiers etc and be rest assured that it was done in a very natural way using steam....i also love the fact that it comes in 3-in-1 and also in 4-in-1 which makes it very indispensable and useful throughout baby's growth and development process.",5
"JJ Cole Bib, Citrus Snack",Not like the old ones at all very cheap and much much thinner than the old generations. I will not purchase again at this price,3
GEENNY Musical Mobile For Boutique Black White Flower &amp; Dot 13 PCS Crib Bedding Set,"the music doesn't last very long even when you wind it all the way up, but it is super cute and still worth it :-)",3
Contours Tandem Car Seat Attachment,"This only fits in one direction, so that the baby is facing the front of the stroller, not you pushing the stroller from behind.  I like having the kids face me so that the wind is not in their face as I move the stroller forward but this attachment doesn't allow that.  I don't think the red straps are that big of a deal as I usually have a blanket over the strap and the child so no one sees the strap anyway.",4
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","I love this style. It is a little loud but I think that helps sooth the baby as well as the music. I love the plug in option, it really helps save on the cost of batteries!",4
"Inglesina 2011 Fast Table Chair, Marina","i just received this for my 7 mth old son in orange and it is perfect!  the seating is nicely padded, the metal arms that anchor to the tabletop feels very solid (no moving or shaky parts).  this feels like a very solid well-made product.  i am anchoring this to our kitchen table in place of his bouncer so he has a place to hang out while i cook, it will be an useful item when we travel or eat out as well.  the only complaint i could have is the underside arms that spin and lock the chair in place could spin more easily to make anchoring this chair to tables much faster but that is a really really small inconvenience.  i am extremely pleased with this product, definitely well-worth the price!",5
"Fisher-Price Long Distance Baby Monitor, 900MHz - White/Grey","We just got the monitor and it works as expected, no interferences, clear sound. We could not see the need for a more expensive unit, and F Price's monitor does the job nicely for a little price tag.",5

"Jeep Wrangler Twin Sport All-Weather Stroller, Heat","We originally went with a similar stroller that was a bit cheaper, but it cracked during the first use!

CTA Digital 2-in-1 iPotty with Activity Seat for iPad,"Just what I was looking for! This will help me to (a) ensure that my child is hooked on electronics before getting potty trained, and (b) teach my child that using the iPad while going potty is perfectly sanitary!",3
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"I thought this would be a great sippy. The straw is like no other. It was great when my LO was learning how to use a straw and it was great for transitioning from a bottle to a sippy for milk. But I have had this sippy cup for a year and a half now and it is not our 'everyday' sippy cup. In fact I try not to use them anymore. They really leak. I have tried everything. I thread them carefully, I tighten the lid, I loosen the lid, I put the top on and tip them side to side to see if they will leak....bottom line is they leak up through the straw (especially if you have a liquid that is coming from the refrigerator to room temp) they leak from the top. You will have the stains of whatever you are putting in this cup on your floor and furniture and down the front of your LO's onsie! My take away from this is buy one or two for 'special' situations where the straw is going to assist in transitioning from a bottle to a sippy but don't use this once your LO gets the hang of things. PS and never take it on a plane, unless you are going to fill it once you are up in the air!",3
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"This monitor is not worth the money. This is our first child and we were very concerned with getting a quality monitor. The night vision has glaring red lights our infant stared at while in her crib. Plus, the image was not super clear. The quality of the item is cheap, as it rattles, the materials are loose and flimsy. Although it claims a specific range, we were always well within this range, yet we would lose connection bc we were &#34;out of range&#34;. I am highly disappointed. Plus, there is no option for a return after 1 month. This item had positive reviews for the most part. I should have listened to the low ratings.",2
"Moby Wrap Organic 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Coconut","I have had a tough time getting my baby to feel comfortable in this. It seems simple enough, but he's colicky and fidgety and we struggle to get him snuggled in the right way (never have been able to).  The fabric is super soft and I love that it's organic.  It's a pretty expensive experiment for us, however. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that we will be able to use it successfully someday soon...",3
Infant Optics DXR-8 Pan/Tilt/Zoom 3.5&quot; Video Baby Monitor With Interchangeable Optical Lens,"The beeping is annoying and super loud.  That is a huge con, which I wish had a volume setting, when the signal goes out on the monitor it beeps REALLY LOUD no kidding you can hear it all over the house it sounds like the house alarm and makes us think someone broke into the house....not cool!Other than that I do not like that the camera has to be plugged in to be used, we got this so that we could move the camera around depending on where the baby took her nap and found out the camera has to be plugged in.Those two are big complaints but bot deal breakers....for now.The screen is nice and big and I can see my baby even with very dim lighting also like how easy it is to use.  We have a townhouse and the signal is good all over.  Also I have not noticed the wireless interfering which was a complaint from other consumers.Oh and by the way you DON'T get the extra lense for free the way the picture shows...you have to buy it.",3
Baby Einstein Bendy Ball,"My five month old son loves playing with this ball! It is one of his favorite toys, and one of the few things I can give to him to keep him occupied so I can get stuff done. The holes make it easy for him to grab and he likes the jingling sound that it makes.",5
PumpEase Classic Collection hands-free pumping bra - Verry Cherry - M,"This product performs as expected, and has a nice design. Allows hands free to type, hold baby, etc. Comfortable. Depending on how long I am pumping for putting it on takes longer than is worth it, but I use it quite regularly",5
Levana Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery and Talk to Baby Intercom,"We've been using the monitor for a month, and it has been working great. After adjusting the contrast in night-vision mode, the quality has met our expectations.Positive:* Intercom quality is very clear. Voices can be easily understood.* To save the battery, the monitor clicks off, then comes right back on when it detects noise. We've always kept it fully charged, except for few-hour-long stretches; the battery gauge has never lost more than a bar.* Intuitive interface that takes a minute to learn, then you've got it.* Picture quality met expectations.Neutral* 5 lullaby-like tunes that play a little bit too loud (tend to wake the baby more than lull back to sleep)* Camera gets a little warmer than I'd like, but not abnormal for this type of electronic deviceNegative:* If a wireless device is too close to the monitor unit, the signal switches on and off, causing the &#34;lost signal&#34; alarm to blare. Don't lean your laptop against the same nightstand or have your cell phone too close; it does interfere just enough to be annoying, but only when in close proximity.Overall, this unit is just about as close to perfect as you can get in this price range. The minor issues (night vision contrast and wireless signal issues) are easy to resolve. After resolutions, the unit outperforms nearly every other monitor in its class.",4
"Graco Pack 'n Play Element Playard, Metropolis","This pack n play was a great investment! I love the changing table and the design of it. It looks very classy and is well made. I would have gave it 5 stars, but it seems like sometimes it gets stuck when trying to fold it, and I wish we could just fold the changing table instead of having to remove it completely after use. Great product overall!",4
Combi Flare Lightweight Stroller in Mandarin,"I bought an older version of this stroller in spring 2006 and have used it regularly for 3 years now.  I own 7 strollers and this one is my favorite for every day use, for travel and for just keeping in the back of the car.  I think it is the best stroller for travel and for people with smaller cars.  I've used it for both of my daughters now, from newborn until 3 years old.Advantages;- the back reclines to nearly flat for sleeping kids, or for babies under 4 months old (this is a must when buying a stroller as far as I'm concerned)- it steers one-handed- it has a zip-up cover of the infant section so the baby can't slip out the bottom- it has a 5-point harness- it folds quite small for trunks and tucking in the corner of restaurants- is lightweight, and has a strap so can be carried over the shoulder for subway trips, etc.- it does actually hold my Baby Trend Flex Loc infant seat quite nicely, albeit forward facing, and it is not snapped in but quite secure- bigger toddler car seats (Britax Roundabout) can hang off the handle bars for trips around airports- has a cup holder for the kid- my 50th percentile 3-year old girl still fits, although she'll be too tall soon- the seat cover comes off for washingDisadvantages- the mesh basket is rather small and sometimes rubs on the wheels, but you can just hang a diaper bag or backpack off the handlebar- the seat back doesn't stay fully up very well, but a single knot of the cords, under the adjuster, keeps it up fine- after 3 years and many flights, the wheels are starting to wobble and one of the upper safety straps doesn't lock onto the seat belt anymore- the handlebar height works great for me (I'm 5'4"") but not really for my husband (but he doesn't like strollers anyway)- no parent cup holder- you must remember to unzip the infant foot cover (that makes it like a bassinet) before you try to fold the stroller down or you will rip the zipper off (easily sewn back on though!)- you need two hands to fold-down the strolleroverall, this is my usual every-day stroller and if I could have only one, this is the one I would choose.btw, the other 6 strollers I have are; single jogging stroller, single cheap umbrella, single travel system stroller, double Maclaren Twin Traveler side-by-side, double umbrella front-back and double jogging stroller",4
"Carters Everyday Easy Dust Ruffle, Blue/Green/Brown",Since cribs vary a good deal at the corners it would be nice if it had more flexibility for the different types of brackets in cribs. However it fit our crib well enough and looks good.,4
"Dr. Sears Smoothie Sipper, Green, 18 Months","This smoothie sipper is just perfect for kids. It is easy to use and easy to clean. It does only hold about 10 oz but that seems the right amount for even my 8 yr old. I originally purchased this for our 3 yr old son, but my older two sons have asked for their own.",5
Baby Buddy: Baby's 1st Toothbrush,What a great purchase.  I buy tons of things for my 7 month old son and he loves this.  We now call him DDS since he will brush his two teeth all the time.  Great for little hands to hold and he can get it in his mouth easily.  He loves to chew on it and I got it when he was 6 months old.Highly recommend!,5
Tadpoles Three Bulb Chandelier in Black Onyx,This is a lovely little chandelier. I wish it was a little bigger though. Its so cute. There is no on/off switch for those wanting to use this as a swag chandelier.,3
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump - Carry All,"I bought the pump in style with my first baby, and with my second one, I decided to switch to Ameda. I loved it, it has fast and slow settings, as well as suction settings, which you can personalize and leave. You could do that with the Medela pump, you had to set it each time. Drove me nuts! It is also much more portable, you can use it with the bag or take just the pump and accessories in your own diaper bag. The Medela pump was built into the bag. On top of everything, Ameda was recommended by my hospital and was far less expensive and cuter with the little blue hearts and ""mommy's milk bag"". Ameda has really personalized it's pump to meet many mom's needs. I wouldn't ever go back!",5
Baby Mosquito Net Baby Toddler Bed Crib Canopy Netting White,Really good product had to do some minor tweaks to the net and had to decorate it for mine and my wife baby boy yhat is coming,4
"Joovy Room&sup2; Portable Playard, Red",Order was received within 5 days after order.  Unit is solid but light enough to move around if necessary.  Does an exceptional job of helping with control of a playful 8 month old female.  Glad I bought it.,5
"Nojo Jungle Tales 2 Pack Monkey Applique/ Print Woven Terry Hooded Towel Set, Large",I love the design of this line of products but the quality is so bad that it looks like an old rag after just one wash. I don't recommend it at all.,2
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","I've just had this one day, but my baby took to it right away.  She is 6 months right now and had always rejected pacifiers until recently when she started teething.  She found a newborn pacifier lying around.  I didn't want to start the pacifier habit at this late in the stage, so I found this one.  The second I showed it to her, she was very happy.  She loves the colors and textures.  She chewed on it like crazy and then when she popped it back out of her mouth, lots of drool went flinging through the air.  :)",5
"Dr. Brown's Standard Dishwashing Basket, Polypropylene","This cleverly-built device holds three assemblies for Dr. Brown's bottles. We own three assemblies. This is a good match. If you're comfortable washing everything in the dishwasher, this is for you - my wife is always concerned about water pooling in the baby gear when we just put it in the utensil tray, and this alleviates that problem. That said, it's pretty expensive for what it does. I'd be happy paying 2-3 dollars for it. (Used is probably a good option.)",4
"Cosco Juvenile APR 40RF Convertible Car Seat, Abbey Lane","I'm not one to write reviews, but I have to say this was a major disappointment.  I bought this for our second car and figured I'd change it up from our other seat (Safety 1st).  There is zero padding in this seat.  It's just a thin layer of fabric over the plastic shell.  I thought about keeping it just to avoid any hassle of a return, but I genuinely can't bring myself to make my daughter endure what is sure to be a wildly uncomfortable ride.  Printing my return label now...",1
"NoJo - Jungle Tales Luxury Plush Throw, Brown",This is such a nice blanket!! It's soft and warm and washes really well. Its perfect for either a boy or a girl and the animals and colors are super cute!! Would definitely purchase again!,5
Peg Perego Primo Viaggio Car Seat / Infant Carrier with LATCH Base - Chesapeake,"I bought this carseat because of the high safety rating, but I was severely disappointed with it.  To begin with, my baby was born in the summer and she would get so hot in this seat if she was in it for very long.  Now that it is winter, she gets overheated when she just has a sweater on, so I don't even want to know what it would be like if she had on a big thick snowsuit.  Second, she has never been very comfortable in it.  More times than not, my otherwise laidback content child will wake up crying if she has fallen asleep in the seat.  There is not alot of room, it is very narrow, so when she is in it, her little arms get stuck almost underneath her.  It is definitely too narrow compared to others I have seen.  Her little feet have started to hang over the front and she is under 27 inches, but for safety reasons we have to buy her a bigger seat.  Lastly, we traveled with this carseat and were disheartened to know we had to bring the base to use the carseat on the airplane.  Even then, my husband had to force the seat into the base because the buckle was in the way of the latch.  Don't let the ratings fool you - this carseat is not worth the money.",2
SheetWorld Fitted Crib / Toddler Sheet - Purple Jersey Knit - Made In USA,Love the color and the fact that is is jersey material but they are a little stiff and scratchy.  Hoping after a couple more washes they will soften up.,3
Dreamer Design Ditto Double Swivel Wheel Axis Kit,"This attachment is wonderful. I was given a double jogger and I bought this to make it more like a regular stroller. I have twins and most double side by side strollers are too wide or too flimsy (umbrella). This gives me the benefit of a sturdy stroller with normal wheels, and its so easy to attach. I get comments from people everywhere I bring it, wondering where I got it. It makes it so much easier to navigate stores and get around, and I thought I'd want to put the bike wheel back on for outdoor use, but these wheels are great even outside on all different terrain.",5
Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,We tried this to transition our 4 month old from the swaddle. It did not work for her. She wakes up every hour in the sleepsuit and sleeps over nine hours straight in the swaddle. We tried for over a week and finally (after we were completely exhausted) we had to go back to swaddling her.,1
"Summer Infant Plush Pals Changing Pad Cover, Green/Brown (Monkey)",Love it! Matches the nursery theme very well Super soft against my baby's skin. Would work for a boy or a girls jungle theme.,5

Baby Einstein Around The World Discovery Center,"I am so HAPPY I brought this item for my 7 months old granddaughter. SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVES IT!!! I love it too, she is a little einstein herself and she loves this discovery center. It is full of entertaining fun, and keeps her busy when I need a break to do other things around the house or cook or whatever. I take time also to help her learn the different activities it has. She love the panda bears seesaw and the leaf with the teether rings she bites that thing like CRAZY as much as the blue flexy teething ring. She already knows how to take them off to use it. She also like the penquin spin ball and the spinning parrot bird. She still learning about how to hit the drum that is in front of the lion. The only complaint I have about the puppet lion is they should make it more removable to be taking off and on. She had a tough time to reach out to touch it, so had to find away to detach it off so she can also have a chance to play with that now. I place it back on the pole with she not playing with it, I use it as a puppet to play and tease her with she loves it. She also loves the 3 bi colored chipped rings that moves from one side to another which helps with colors and number learning. Most of all she loves the little music box that has 3 variety of music to listen to, from classical to mumba it sound like, ha ha she already learning how to dance to the tunes and I love to dance with her also. It also has three levels to raise higher and to choose from, and it spins and turn in all directions for her to play with any of the activities, GREAT! What tickles me the most is my son HER DAD, said to me a couple of weeks ago, ""Mom, I need a Baby Einstein too, because I always holding her and I need to do my things too."" I laughed and said ""Why do you think I brought this particular activity center to help her with her motor and learning skills and to keep her busy when I need to do my things around the home."" In one word ""FANTASTIC"" work Baby Einstein Manufacturer Company, GREAT WORK on this product. I will be looking to purchase more Baby Einstein products in the near future. One of my girlfriends mentioned she will keep this product in mind as a baby gift if she needs one in the future due to my recommendation and baby stories I shared with her. I told her come to Amazon for good products and a good buying price, you can't lose here. I have another favorite place I like to buy things from, and when I can't find what I want there, I always come here now, Amazon is my other favorite place to buy now. Good quality with good prices and steals. GO AMAZON!!!!",5
"OXO Tot Tub Kneeling Mat, Blue","This mat is extremely hard and not cushiony at all.  I am seriously considering returning it since it's not providing the comfort I expected from a kneeling mat, most of all an expensive kneeling mat.  A $4 gardening mat offers more cushion than this OXO mat.",1
Kids Line Lamp Base &amp; Shade - Lady Bug,"The lamp was very cute, but I ended up returning it after receiving the matching comforter (the kids version, not the crib set) and it was not of good quality. Baby Supermall was great about the return, and the lamp was the best thing about the set.",4

Infantino Baby Girl Animals Twist and Fold Activity Gym and Playmat,"I just received this in the mail! I would recommend this product to everyone!! It was easy to put together, and just as easy to fold back up and put away. The toys are nice and soft, some even jingle, and the mirror fits on nice and tight. It was a very good buy, and im very satisfied with my purchase!!",5
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","I had been using lunchskins and to be honest, we lost the one in the size we like.  So I ordered 3 of these bags (monkey, plaid and cupcake).First off - the bags themselves are great!  With our previous bags, I had to work to wash out those bottom corners.  I love that I can easily turn this bag inside out and scrub it down.  Love that!  I also love that the zipper is easy for little 3 year old fingers to work, because my daughter loves to pack her own lunch.  We have used them for 4 days and so far so good, but I don't expect that this is the type of bag to wear out quickly.  It feels too well made for that.I also want to mention that the customer service is fabulous!  They accidentally sent me a money and 2 plaid, instead of the monkey, the plaid and the cupcake. When I asked them how to handle this (expecting to return one), they checked the original order, saw the mistake and said to keep the second plaid bag and that they would send me a cupcake bag.  That kind of customer service seems to be rarer and rarer, and is very much appreciated!I can already see these bags getting a ton of use this summer, at the beach, at the zoo, etc... because they are just so easy to fill, carry and clean, and really, that is all I expect from these bags.",5
"Momma Rocking Cup with Straw and Dual Handle, Orange","I'm surprised at the number of negative reviews, and actually might not have bought the product had I seen them. We like this cup! It's one of the few straw cups safe for younger babies, and the soft straw is reassuring even as your baby grows. As noted by other reviewers, it does leak if turned upside down, and maybe has a tendency to tip toward the straw side if dropped - but these things have not been major nuisances. It's a sippy cup our baby likes, it appears to be safe, is relatively easy to clean, and is a cute little design. The alternatives are traditional sippy cups or straw cups with hard straws - neither of which worked for us. We're fans, and would like to buy another if they were not all out of stock.",4
"Summer Infant Easton Tote, Black/White",I absolutely LOVE this bag.  It is the best one by far that I have found and the price is unbelievable for what you get.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  The purple lining is nice.  It really does look like a very expensive bag.  I would not trade this for any bag out there.,5
Sugar Booger &quot;Vroom&quot; Feeding Collection Silverware Set,"I love this set. The case is big enough to fit a couple of wet wipes and/or a thin bib (like the Bumkins ones) folded up, which is absolutely perfect to throw in a purse and go - no bulky bag required!",4
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,"Have had this for about a year. The past month it has developed an almost constant buzzing sound. Have tried repositioning it, turning it off for a 'rest', but nothing gets rid of the buzz. I will try to contact the manufacturer to see if they have any suggestions. If anyone has a suggestion, please let me know.",1
Leachco Natural Boost - Adjustable Nursing Pillow - Denim,"I was given this pillow as a gift, and it is the best nursing pillow I've tried. I can nurse using just this pillow and one extra one behind me for my back (to make sure I'm fully upright)--no other pillows necessary! However, I have noticed that one side props our baby up a little awkwardly while the other side lays smoothly because of the strap design and placement, but it's not that big of an issue. I only wish this pillow was waterproof or came with some covers! To prevent constant cleaning, I put a receiving blanket over it each time I nurse, but if your baby is a spitter-upper, still plan on spot cleaning regularly and steam cleaning every couple weeks.",5
Nintendo Super Mario Princess Peach 16 inch Backpack - Black and Pink,"This backpack  tore apart in less than two months school. Princess peach fell off completely and couldn't reattach it. Also a hole appeared in the back of the backpack, because the fabric wore off.  I had to buy another one for my 6 year old daughter",1
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Bath Center - Aquarium,"Our little one loves her bath. Others have mentioned the hammock being a problem after a couple of months--you need to remove the hammock part when they get bigger, that is just for newborns.  We removed the hammock when she was about 8 weeks old.  She can't sit up on her own yet, but we can sit her up with her little butt on the seat part (that's the ""weird bump"" people keep mentioning.  It's a seat.) to wash her, then if to rinse or if she gets cold I can sit her in the main part of the tub. This is a perfectly good tub, our 3 month old loves it and we've had no problems with it so far.",4
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","I needed a bed for my grandchildren when they come to visit.  This one sets up in seconds.  When folded in its accompanying storage bag, it takes up very little room and is easily stored.  I would suggest putting extra padding on it before covering with a sheet.  The metal frame can be felt through the canvas.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Got this for my 4 1/2 year old son, he loves animals and stars!  He's really enjoyed looking for constellations.We do love this turtle, great as a night light and buddy.",5
"Soft Gear My Booster Seat, Mint","Contoured seat owners, never fear!  This will work just fine.  We have oak kitchen chairs that are contoured, and my little 2 year old boy always pulls himself up on this.  It is a rubbery material on the bottom, so even if the suctions are not &#34;sucked&#34; down on the chair, it still works as it should.  Also like the fact that I can sit down when necessary for a moment or two, as the soft material doesn't make this uncomfortable.",5
"Diaper Changing Mat - Waterproof, Wipeable &amp; Washable - Baby &amp; Toddler - Made in USA - RIVIERA",I absolutely love this mat!!  It is really  light and easy to keep in my diaper bag.  The pattern is gorgeous and makes a dirty job a bit nicer :).  The mat is really good quality and folds up nicely.  I would highly recommend this mat and this company to anyone!!,5

"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","I was more than pleased with this bottle brush. I had a number of brushes given to me at my shower with foam sponge tips. After a dozen or so times washing bottles/pump parts, the sponge got weak and fell apart. This brush is completely bristles and they are soft and flexible. The nipple brush is great and perfect for small parts. I have it right beside my sink on the stand, which keeps it clean!",5
"PRIMO Folding Potty with Handles, White granite","We bought this for bringing along when shopping etc for our 20mo old potty trained girl. It fold up really nice (approx 6x6) and you never have to touch the side that touches the toilet. There a two handles for the kid to hold onto if they want, and the ring covers the entire front of the toilet, so they don't have to touch anything ikky either.",5
Philips Avent Express Microwave Sterilizer,"I bought this item and realized that my microwave was 1500 watts and it is for 500-1100 wattage microwaves.  I called and the rep told me i could use it with my wattage.  Dont do it, it burned up my microwave somehow.  Avent says this is not possible, but what  a cooincidence.",1
Bib Toddler Pocket Assorted Colors 1 Count,"I bought a this bib in yellow, and have had no issues with dye, as another reviewer mentioned.  I got this bib before a trip, and found it was great for travel.  It's very lightweight and folds down to almost nothing, the pocket flap at the bottom catches falling food, and the best part is that I can wash it quickly with a little soap and water, wring it out, and it's dry by the next meal!  Now I use it at home a lot too, because it saves me from washing so many cloth bibs.  Great bib, and you really can't beat the price.",5

"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing, Luv U Zoo","We are so happy with this swing! It is so quiet! I read a lot of reviews that said the motor is really loud. This is not true at all! The motor is incredibly quiet. Our little one absolutely enjoys this swing for sleep and play! He especially loves the nature sounds and the mobile. We're very impressed with the music too. It's not the high pitched annoying tone that most baby toys have. This item is definitely a MUST HAVE for me and my husband! I'm just sad we waited 5 weeks before getting it. We're able to cook and clean the house now instead of having to rock and bounce our baby all the time. Plus there's times when only the swing can soothe him to sleep. It's such a godsend.The swing is much cuter in person than in the pictures on here. The colors are beautiful, bright, and have a simple pattern on them. Love the removable tray feature as our baby is still really young and can't appreciate it yet. We also love that it's so easy to break down and set up. We took it on a trip with us recently and it surprisingly wasn't a hassle to bring with us! The different speeds are great and none of them have been too fast for our little one. We use the slow speed when he's having stomach trouble and the fast when we want to soothe him or get him to sleep. The swing doesn't take up nearly as much space as we thought it would either. It comes with an extension cord which allows us to put the swing almost anywhere. This is just such a great product! We are 100% satisfied.Updated: forgot to update this. I and a friend had the motor break on this swing after having it less than a year. Fisher Price has amazing customer service though and were able to help me get a working swing. They were out of stock on motors however, which gave me the impression this is a very common problem. I don't know if they've fixed this problem since the fall, but if not, go for a different swing. I had great luck with a different Fisher Price swing when this one broke.",5
"Britax Head and Body Support Pillow, Iron/Gray","This is a great support pillow. I like this one because it has head and body support. With my new born,He would slump over, and most heAd support wrapped his head on the outside so he would get all sweaty.There are two sides, a grey shifter yet cooler fabric, and a fleece, which tends to be warm to baby. I MainlyUse this for our stroller now, he's still small and needs padding to keep him from flopping around.",5

"Summer Infant  Multi Use Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, White","I have been using this gate for over two years now and it still works great. At some point the auto-close feature stopped working, but I actually prefer it this way as before it would slam closed noisily if you didn't catch it first. It was important to me to have a tall gate as my son has always been 95%+ for height. I've never needed to use the extensions, but I appreciate that it comes with them. My only con is that the bar on the bottom is tall enough that everyone in my family has almost tripped/tripped over it at least once.I'm a little surprised by so many bad reviews as we've never had any problems despite my son being very rough with it at times. He is 4 now and we still use this gate on our bathroom and he hasn't figured out how to open it yet. For comparison, we went through 3 or 4 fridge locks before finding one that he didn't figure out how to open the same day. Maybe we just lucked out..This was the first/only gate I got with a door so I'm not sure how it compares to others, but there are some great reviews that do make comparisons. I don't know how I got through that first year+ stepping over gates all the time, definitely worth the extra $$ to get one with a door.",4
"ERGObaby Original Infant Insert, Natural","Allows me to carry my new born easily and safely in the ergo baby, keeping my hands free to tend to my toddler . can be a little tricky to insert on first uses, but gets easier. I feel my infant's head is safe and secure with this.",4

Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This gate is great. We love the natural wood finish. I have had this gate for 6 years and it still looks like new! We used it to keep our Cocker Spaniel in the tiled part of the house while we were at work. Every time I use it, I think to myself how much I like it. It is very easy to open and shut. I like how it is securely bolted to the wall. However, if you don't want to put screws in your wall, this may not be the right one for you.",5
"UPPAbaby Cabana Infant Car Seat Shade, Red","Pros:Easy to installEasy to fold and put back in carry pouchAttractiveEasy to get to child with zippersGreat for bugsGreat to shield from sunAttached sun shield easy stores in attached front pocketCons:The silver sun/rain shade is very loose.Only 3 snaps to hold it down.Works okay for rain in a light rain, but, in a heavy downpour water will just run around the sides of the shade and drip down onto the baby.Now, since it installs over the canopy (under the handle) it is nice for extra protection for when you get stuck in an unexpected downpour.I would not recommend using it for a rain shield.I would buy another type of cover as a rain shield. But as a bug shield and sun proctector it's perfect.I do however like this product. Maybe if the silver cover zipped on like a coat zips up you could still take the silver sun shield off and stowe it but it would work better for rain (hint, hint, manufacturer).",4
Munchkin Sprout Drying Rack,I love this product- it is sturdy enough to hold all of our plastic bottles and pump parts. It keeps all small pieces elevated from the water in the drip tray. The drip tray does not drain itself so you will want to clean it occasionally. The little bit of water that gets in there usually just evaporates on its own. The cup section can hold all of my small pump parts and has drain holes in the bottom of it so the little pieces are not just sitting in a cup of water. Great product- well worth the money!,5
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Double Stroller, Shadow/Orange","I love this stroller!!  This stroller is well made & so easy to push!  I don't even feel like I'm pushing 50-lbs.  My girls are very tall.  My three year old is 41-in, weighing about 30-lbs & my 10mo old is 28-in weighing about 20-lbs.  They both fit in it!  The only time the canopy bothers my 3yr old is when it's pushed all the way back. But when it's extended, she fits under it fine.  The canopy needs to be tweaked a little so it doesn't go far down when it's not being used to allow more head room.My biggest pick about this stroller right now is that I got a defected model.  For some crazy reason the stroller won't fold at all!  So for the past week I've been dealing with the helpful customer service in making a warranty claim.  It's just a pain because I wasn't expecting this issue immediately upon receiving my brand new stroller.This stroller is worth the money & I love it!  I will just enjoy it more when I get a fully functioning one that will fold, whether the one I have gets repaired or exchanged.  I used a tandem style double stroller sit-n-stand before this & there's no comparison.  The tandem stroller was such a pain to push.  This jogger makes walking a breeze!",4
Red - Ballet Tutu - Fairy Princess Ballerina Dress-Up for Toddler &amp; Little Girls,No surprises here.  It looks exactly like in the pictures on the listing.  It does exactly what it's supposed to.,5
Lullabelly Prenatal Music Belt - Sky Blue,"I highly recommend lullabelly as a gift (5 stars). I gave it to my wife 2 weeks ago and she loves it, she has it on everyday when I get home from work. Its comfortable enough that she can wear it around the house and even wears it on her walks around the neighborhood. I completely believe music helps the baby develop, and I think this is way safer than the headphones she was trying to use. I think lullabelly is a great value/price compared to the other products out there that I read reviews on.",5
"Summer Infant 2 Pack Microfleece Swaddleme, Blue","We ordered the swaddles right after we got home from the hospital. They arrived the next day and really helped! Our baby ws so active and fussy that she needed to be swaddled pretty much all the time. She could easily get out of a regular blanket swaddle but these proved harder thought not as good as the halo swaddles.Pros:1. Soft strong material (did not get destroyed even after being washed 3 times a week for 6 weeks)2. Warm when it's cold, not too warm when it is hot (they have a vent for temperature regulation at the back)3. Baby finds it much harder to unswaddle herself than with regular blanket though not as good as a similar product from halo4. Cheaper than similar products by other brandsConsRuns small. Product description says 0-4 months so I figured it would fit for at least the first 2 months. We had a regular sized baby and it is too tight around her and she is now 7 weeks old and 10 pounds. It is also too short for her...her legs need to be folded up for it to fit and she is only 21.5 inches now. However I would not size up because there is a very small range of measurements that can be swaddled by each size.",4
Safety 1st 2 Pack Grip n' Go Cabinet Lock,I bought five packs of these and opened the first pack and the first one slid open with much force and work the second one wouldn't even open.  I wanted to use these in the kitchen thinking that they would be easy to get in and out of since we go into cabinets on a daily basis.  I will be returning all of them immediately.  Don't waste your money on these and especially do not use in kitchen or else you will starve!,1
"Contours Options LT Tandem Stroller, Valencia Gold","My grand daughter selected this tandem stroller after reviewing the information on-line and discussing these strollers with other mothers.  When it arrived (right on time), she could hardly wait to use it.  She has one son born in April of 2012 and another born in 2013, two days before his brother's first birthday.  Needless to say, a tandem stroller was a necessity.  She loves the way the seats can be configured in several different ways.  The stroller is not as heavy as many of the others are and is easy to manuever. We had talked to a couple of people with Graco tandems, which we were originally considering.  They said that they were very heavy, hard to fit in the car, and that in order to turn corners they often had to lift the rear portion of the stroller off the ground.  It made it easy for us to make the decision to look elsewhere.  The Contours Options folds easily and doesn't seem to take as much space in the trunk as some models.  All in all, this has been a very good experience and my granddaughter and great grandsons love, love, love the stroller.",5
"Boppy Travel Pillow, Mama Dot/Basket Green","So glad I bought this. My son needs to bro propped up comfortably (or he fusses endlessly). I was traveling with two neck pillows but just couldn't get him comfortable, and it was quite inconvenient. This travel Boppy is wonderful. It is plump enough to give adequate support, but still folds up nicely. The carrying case does not shout &#34;I breastfeed!&#34; And is quite cute. It's also machine washable. Love it!",5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Crib 'N Go Projector Soother,My baby absolutely loves this toy.  It is even better than the mobile I bought.  Easy to install and transport.  It goes with us when we go on trips.  My older kids even want one for their rooms.,5
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),"These scalp massagers are fantastic!  They look kind of ridiculous but work amazingly!  You really don't need any sort of skill or coordination for them to work wonderfully.  They're great for relaxing at the end of the day or helping with headaches and tension.  This three pack is great if you have roommates, a partner, or family members who might try to grab it.",5
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,"You can't baby-proof without some of these.  I like that they are not super-hard for me to get out, but my son isn't dexterous enough to do it yet.  I hope he won't be for a while longer!",5
"The Shower Hug for Pregnant and Nursing Moms., X/S, White with Petal Pink Trim","Bought and had to return this for 2 reasons:1.  Sizing was wrong, making the coverage area for the breasts a bit weird2.  Skin was irritated after wearing it.",2
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby",Didn't work with our tap.,1
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","I will never purchasing another brand of strollers for running/jogging!Don't bother with cheaper brands. Just get the Bob!I tried running with phil and teds, baby expedition and even with regular chiccos. And the Bob BLOWS everything else out of the water. Super great for all terrains and I trained for a half marathon with my kiddo in tow!Super smooth ride with comfy seats for the little ones. I added the tray for my little girl and the handlebar console for my water and phone.Trust me. Just buy BOB!",5
"JJ Cole Mode Diaper Tote Bag, Black Magnolia","I purchased my JJ Cole Mode bag about a year ago.  I was attracted to the functionality of all its deep, strategically placed pockets.  Also it has a nice coordinating changing pad and pacifier pod.  It served me well, except the fabric did not hold up under normal wear conditions.  My friends had the same bag and didn't have this problem, and I wasn't using my bag any more heavily than they did.  So I wrote to JJ Cole's customer service and they agreed to send me a new one under their 2-year warranty policy.  Overall, I've been pleased with the bag's style and functionality.  I'm hoping that the replacement bag will wear better.",3
"OXO Tot Flip-Top Snack Cup, Green, 5 Ounce","My son loves flipping the lid open and pulling his snacks out. He makes more of a mess with this cup than the pointy flap munchkin cups we have, but this cup provides some entertainment for him which I occasionally need while we are out and about. These cups are really cute and hold a good amount of snacks and I imagine as my son gets more skilled with his grabbing that this cup will be our favorite go to for all snacks.",5
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I started with Dr. Browns bottles but since I don't have a dishwasher I was ready to shoot myself when cleaning them. These are so much better.Super easy to clean (I just soak everything in the sink with hot water, dish soap and a little white vinegar) and the bent angle has been great. My baby is a super fast eater and I can actually slow him down by twisting the bottle while in his mouth after a few gulps and letting him suck on the empty nipple, then twist back again to give him a little more, repeat the process until he's done. He has a fit if you take the bottle out of his mouth. I thought that would make him super gassy but it hasn't at all.I haven't had any leaks (I have 12 bottles) and I even use a warmer although they recommend not using one. I found the condensation from the warmer does collect in the bottom lid gap but I just cap the bottle, turn upside and tap the bottom on a kitchen towel to get the excess water out.Highly recommend these if you have a fast eater!",5
Philips AVENT Digital Screen Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"The Philips monitor has some good characteristics and some mediocre ones:The night light is a good addition to the monitor. I found the light to be adequate and not too bright. This monitor also offers music. I like the musical selections but the sound quality is only so so.The idea of giving me the temperature in the baby room is great. However, when I had the parent unit with me in the kitchen while I was baking, it kept warning me of the temperature in the baby's room. Is it giving me the temp for the baby room or the temp for the room I'm in? It flashed 80 repeatedly but the baby's room was actually rather cool. And am I missing something or shouldn't there be a sound alert that goes with this warning?This is a decent baby monitor, but it's not really for me and my baby. She's usually very quiet when she wakes. She almost never cries which makes a monitor without video practically useless for us.",3
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",We bought this booster seat when my daughter turned 1 and we love it.  It's very practical and portable.  It's also easy to clean.  I wish I would've bought this earlier instead of the big bulky highchair we got.,5
"Carter's Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Lily Pad Frog","Bought these for my daughter who is 2 months into motherhood.  She couldn't believe how easy these made her life. She had been given some of a lesser quality, rubber backed terry cloth that were very small. The Carter's are soft against her baby's skin and and the edges stay flat after washing many times. The large size makes them perfect! Yea!",5
"Waterproof Baby Bibs with Snaps for Girls &amp; Boys, Gift Box 10 Pack, Solid Colors","These bibs really work. They are actually waterprooof and the terry cotton soaks up the spills too. They do make a little bit of a crackling sound if scrunched due to the waterproof layer inside, but its not loud at all. My son actually likes to scrunch the bib while he is wearing it. Even though he tries, he still isn't able to get his bib off, which is great. The problem I've found with velcro bibs, is that they can be easily pulled off which defeats the point of wearing a bib. I would happily recommend these bibs to other moms.",5
"Tadpoles 36 Sq Ft ABC Floor Mat, Pink/Brown",We have hardwood floors and bought these mats for the baby to crawl and play on.  It's a great alternative to laying blankets on the floor that slide around.  It's easy to clean.  I will note that my two year old niece had it ripped apart in minutes.  I think it's for young babies and not great for active babies that can pull it apart.  It also easily gets dog scratches on it from my dog's claws.,5
Playtex Baby Drop-Ins Orthodontic Latex Nipple: Medium Flow - 2 Pack,"I was so excited when I got these in the mail, because my daughter hasn't been happy with a single nipple yet. I thought these would do the trick, but she cannot latch onto them properly. She is exclusively bottlefed, so she doesn't open her mouth up very wide like a breastfed baby would. I give these nipples a 1 star because they are just plain NASTY! I don't know what they made these out of, or what they put on them, but they smell terrible! Like..chicken bouillon or something..pretty gross. I probably wouldn't use these even if my baby liked them, just because of how bad they stink.",1
14&quot; X 29&quot; X 2&quot; Replacement Mattress Pad for Baby's Use,"We received a family heirloom bassinet (one that my wife slept in as a newborn) for our newborn, which was great however the size of bassinet mattress back then is slightly different than the current common mattress sizes.I was relieved to find this mattress in this particular size.Came packaged nicely. It is made by Colgate, which is a pretty reputable kid mattress brand. Best of all it is made in the USA!!! And no funky smells either.Baby seems to like it well enough. I like that it is pretty firm, as that is suggested as a prevention of SIDS.",5
Kleenex Cottonelle Fresh Flushable Moist Wipes - 346 ct,"Feel very clean and refreshed after use. Don't have to worry about urine smell,or dirty skids on panties. much more sanitary way to wipe.",5
The First Years Massaging Action Teether,"If I can recommend one teether to buy for your teething baby, it would be this one. The vibration made it fun and it took the edge off for my little guy. The shape/handle made it really easy for him to hold. We never leave the house without this thing and it is the go-to gift I give to all my expecting friends.",5
Safety 1st Power Strip Cover,"This is a perfect baby proofing tool.  The strip cover will cover most standard sized power strips.  There is a hole on the side for the power strip to plug into the outlet and a wide opening on top for it to connect to the devices plugged into it.  It is really easy to put together- just snap shut in 3 places.  It is also easy to adjust as there is a button on the side that allows you to slide it between different sizes.  Overall, best power strip cover I've seen.",5
B-Agile Double Rain Cover,"I was skeptical at first because of the price but I'm glad I made the right decision. It's extremely sturdy and fits amazingly to the frame almost like the Maclaren rain covers. It has a cool factor for all the detachable areas for sure. You definitely look awesome pushing your stroller with it and it doesn't look cheap. It's a very thick plastic so the kiddies never get wet. I hate seeing those generic rain covers because they never fit properly. They look cheap too with the plastic never laying right and being so thin. Ladies, you won't be disappointed with this one. I just wish Britax could've included it with my purchase as Maclaren does because the stroller isn't cheap!",5
"Jeep Overland Limited Jogging Stroller with Front Fixed Wheel, Fierce","It is a great jogging stroller, very neat design, and specially is very sturdy, exactly what you need for a Jogging stroller. Slighlty oversized to the front, which makes it harder to handle it tighter spaces, however it is one of the best i've seen.Pros: Easy to assemble, cool design, easy to fold, sturdy frame and wheels.Cons: Bulky and heavy when folded, slighlty oversized for confined spaces.",4
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,"the plastic does feel cheap, as some of the reviews said.i did buy a cover so hopefully it will last longer. its only 15 bucks so when it does rip i won't feel too guilty to buy a new one.",4
"Bright Starts High Chair, Sweet Spots and Lady Bugs",I love my daughters highchair it folds so I have room to but it anywhere.Her nickname is luvbug and da funny thing about it has luvbugs on da highchair!!!!!! I definitely recommend this item!!!,5
Playtex 2 Pack VentAire Silicone Slow Flow Nipple,This is the perfect flow for my 2 month old twin. The other twin uses Dr Brown's bottles because of her gas but these bottles and nipples work great as well. Equally great,5
"Munchkin Two Snack Catchers, Colors May Vary",it seems to be a good product but my daughter does not want to use it so it has been there since i bought it,3
Bedtime Originals Hello Kitty and Puppy Wallpaper Border - Pink,This matches so well with the bedding ans other accessories that we bought foe my daughters room. Definitely recommend for HK fans.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue",I was in a hurry and didn't pay enough attention to the length of this cot.  Therefore I was surprised to get it and find that mygrandchildren will only be able to use until the age of 6-8.,3
Mobi Tykelight GloMate Plus,"This is a cute night light which little kids love. However, the main problem I see with this is that it does not illuminate when it is on the charger. Thus, when it runs out of juice and you place it on the charger at the beginning of your sleep cycle, you won't have expected light until it is charged. I would prefer using it on the charger at all times since it is less likely to be ""dead"" when you need it. So it is rather inconvenient to have to monitor, if it is used like any other nightlight....every night.",2
Easy Teether Crib Rail Cover - Pink,This works ok. I have one I bought that is bigger from Babies R Us but twice as much. That one my girls can't get off the crib while this one I've had to reinforce with basting pins. All-in-all though it's good for the price.,4
Gerber Graduates Kiddy Cutlery 3 Piece Fork Set,They have a nice color and nice grip for little hand. I wish I cold find matching spoons too to match.,5
"Luvable Friends Woven Crib Sheet, White","I wish I would have gone with the carters jersey ones I've always gotten before instead of saving a bit of money on these. I felt like I was going to rip the sheet while putting it on the mattress. These will do for now, but I will be getting some jersey ones soon.",1
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner, Orange","This brush probably lasts longer than it should. We had our original OXO brush for several years and finally got rid of it, not because it had worn out, but we were worried about a buildup of bacteria and other nasty things that inevitably collect over time. Expect this one to be long lasting as well. We went through 4-5 competitor brushes in the same time that we had one of these. Great buy.",5
"Keekaroo Peanut Diaper Changer, Solid Lime","Worth the extra money for this changing pad- it's still soft & cushy, but  yet plastic, so extremely easy to wipe down after &#34;accidents.&#34;",5
SOHO Curious Monkey 5 in 1 Deluxe Diaper Bag *Limited time offer*,This is a very cute diaper bag and I love the extras that comes with it. Would make a very cute baby shower gift.,5
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Lamp with Shade and Bulb, Emma",i was praying for $46.00 it was going to be a good sturdy lamp we could use forever and IT IS!!! Ceramic and well made. Habent used it yet but i cannot wait to plug it in and see it with the rest of the room.,5
Infantino Savvy Diaper Bag,I thought it was going to be a little bigger. I do like the changing pad connected. It is good for quick trips out.,3
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","We bought this car seat from Amazon, 3-4 years ago.I wasn't a huge fan of this car seat.1.  The rubber started wearing off, after use, more specifically on the arm rests and the buckle.  This might be, because we live in a warmer climate.2.  This car seat is sooo hard to clean, little things like pieces of food, hair, pieces of crafts from school get lodged into very small nooks and crannies under the fabric.  It's like trying to clean out a bunch of little sink drains.  While I do like that the fabric is easy to get off and clean, what is under it, is extremely gross, and hard to clean.  It also scares me to put water under the car seat where I cannot see, and I don't know if it will rust.3.  This car seat is HUGE, it takes up an adult seat and a quarter.  No one is able to use the middle row seat in our backseat row, because it covers up both the buckles.  It also negates the 3 in one aspect.  Since it covers up the buckle, I would never be able to use this seat without the 5 point harness.4.  After about a year of use the bottom buckle started to stick, so much so that it scared me.  I feared, I would not be able to detach my son from his car seat.  Especially when we have 110 degree heat.  This is the point where we bought a new seat for regular use.5.  The belt material is extremely hard to untangle and set right.Bottom line, I like my car seat that was less than half the price, much, much better.  I'm sorry I spent so much in the first place.  I should have listened to the experts, a more expensive car seat is playing off people's fears, it really isn't going to operate any better.",2
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,"I hate this pump. I dread pumping, but spent so much money, I don't want to go spend more.  It is far from gentle, the *comfort* pad hurts, and it is ineffective.  I am constantly having to pull my breast out and reset as it either backs up, or it stops pumping.  Once I hit a certain amount in the bottle, it won't even pull more milk out of me-- even if I still have plenty.A friend recommeded it, but both I and another friend can't figure out why.  She has even more problems with it because she is smaller figured.The only two things that it has going for it are 1) it is easier to pump with one hand than another I have tried, and 2) you can assemble it with one hand if you have a screaming baby and you are engorged to the point where the baby can't even latch on.  Other than that, it is worthless.",1
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,There's nothing special about these. They do the job and they are large enough to cover the 3rd-prong hole (ground wire).,4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,I got this as a gift before I had my son. He enjoys this swing a lot. He was given this swing and a take along swing. Though honestly is the take along swing had a plug in option I would probably have given this one up. As I said it is pretty bulky and does not really store well unless you take it completely apart which can be problematic in a smaller space. It has provided many hours of comfort to my son though from newborn to five months and counting.,4
"Boba 3G Baby Carrier, Montenegro Black","Before a recent trip to NYC I realized both that my 2 year old (~28lbs) had outgrown her beloved Beco Gemini and that I had no desire to push a stoller which would be empty 80% of the time around town.  From reviews the Boba seemed like the best option for a bigger child and it surpassed my expectations.  The carrier is structured to create an effective ""seat"" which is very comfortable for the child - she asked to go in it when she was tired and never complained when she was carried.  The additional height prevented my daughter from ""arching"" back in both the front and back carries - while still enabling her arms to be free and over the straps.  While admittedly I rarely have back problems, I was able to carry her for long stretches with no discomfort and, a not small detail for me, the straps were short enough so that the carrier hung nicely (not dragging or tripping me as the Gemini does) when it was not being used by the child.  As babies, both of my children INSISTED on the front facing carry (I have used both the Bjorn Active and Gemini extensively) and also wanted substantial arm movement so I do not think this would have worked for us as a newborn to toddler carrier.  I do wish I had bought it earlier (maybe at 15 months or so...) but in no way regret the purchase as I am sure it will get a lot use and save me from pushing the empty stroller for at least another year.Update May 11, 2014.My daughter is now 3.5 years, almost 40 pounds and more than 3ft tall, and we still keep this carrier in the car and travel with it as it our go to ""nap on the go"" device.  Typically we load a carry bag (I.e. Whole food cheapie re usable) and I put that in the carrier and wear it as a de facto knapsack.  When nap time comes along, my daughter goes to the carrier and my husband carries the bag.  We have gotten every cent worth out of this carrier even though I bought for a 2 year old.  If you have an average size child and few back problem and are looking for a stroller alternative, buy this carrier",5
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,"When I got the milk saver, I was all ready to be excited about it! In fact, I used it for a week before I figured out what was really wrong with it. And now, my kid is 3 months old and I don't use it.First, as other reviewers have said, it's huge and really not appropriate to use in public, or even while running around the house. Second, there is pretty much no way to use it at night if you nurse in bed. That was the kicker for me. I was leaking at night every time I fed, and I was pretty sure that if I had been able to collect that milk, I was looking at least an ounce leaked per feeding. During the day I was only getting .25 to .5 of an ounce per feeding. Over the course of a day I could collect enough for a feeding, but I was needing to wash the milk saver every time I fed, have two bottles going in the fridge at all time (one cold, one just pumped at room temperature) and it was a LOT of monkeying around to collect roughly 2 oz per day.I've also stopped leaking so much, so now the milk saver wouldn't do much for me at all.So just remember, every woman is different. If the price isn't prohibitive for you, this might allow you to save a lot of milk that would otherwise be wasted.",3
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","Baby boy refused to nap more than 25 minutes at a time at two months of age. I was putting him in his crib, which he doesn't dislike, but it was driving me crazy that he didn't get enough daytime sleep (and I didn't, either!). I bought the monkey version of this swing out of desperation. He didn't take to it right away, but with some persistence, swaddling, and white noise it became a place I could put him where he would happily and IMMEDIATELY fall asleep, and nap for 2 hours or more. That is worth it's weight in gold. Highly recommend if your baby needs a little help with napping. Obviously I will eventually transition him to the crib for naps, but for now, we are getting on a nap schedule and he is learning to fall asleep on his own. I am so grateful for this item.",5
"Lifefactory 9-Ounce Glass Bottle, Raspberry","I love that this is glass.  It washes easily and is fairly easy to handle.  It is a bit on the heavier side. For bottles, I p[refer the SImba BPA Free Diamond Glass because it is so much lighter but those do not convert to a sippy cup whereas this one does. Weight is the only issue.",4
"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","Much better construction than other gates we tried.  Self closing actually works.  Easy to operate with one hand. Being taller parents, it just makes sense.  Set up was 15 minutes with 10"" extension and smaller one it came with to accommodate for the wide opening.  Our little one seems to like it.",5
"Graco Century Compact Swing, Jungle Boogie","This was purchased as a gift for my granddaughter. She, and her mother, loves it. It fees up time so her mom can get some much needed rest.",5
"Delta Enterprise Corp Silverton 4 In 1 Crib, Dark Cherry",I really love this crib and look forward to using it!  The directions were pretty easy to follow to put it together.,5
Philips Avent BPA Free Natural Infant Starter Gift Set,"I've been using these Avent bottles for 5 months. They are easy to put together, they have a very realistic nipple. NO problem with nipple confusion. They are also easy to clean with the attached blue brush. However, if you have a fussy kid, you may consider Dr Brown series which I used for my elder son.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00078ANK2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp;=1789&creative;=390957&creativeASIN;=B00078ANK2&linkCode;=as2&tag;=theaventblog-20",5
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","Exchanged my MBP33 for this one, and SO HAPPY to have done so!Pan/Tilt: Unless you mount the camera in one place (we move it around the house) the MBP33 is a hassle to position. This would be true for any fixed/manual positioning camera. The MBP33 ended up being an audio-only monitor, which is why it was returned. However, with the MBP33 you just need to place it approximately right, and can adjust later, once you get to where the monitor is.Zoom: It's a digital zoom, so the resolution is far than impressive.Screen: The larger screen is also very nice and clear.Night vision: Works great in a pitch-black room.Temperature Monitor: It's actually more useful than what I thought :)Range: The range is REALLY good, and the receiver beeps if you go too far. The MBP36 had a longer range than the MBP33, and in our house it's really important since the media room is 2 stories below the baby's bedroom. The MBP33 barely cut it on the range, but the MBP36 has much stronger signal.Sound: The microphone is balanced. Not too sensitive yet good enough to hear our baby right when he starts fussing.I don't think that the lullabies are very useful, and my baby is a bit too young to benefit from me talking with him from the other room over the speaker.Summary: Very good products that delivers on its promise.",5
Sesame Street Elmo Adventure Potty Chair,"This was a great surprise from Santa this morning!  I love that the bowl is bigger than my sons other toddler potty, and my son loves the Elmo is swimming and that it flushes.  I have great hope that this will be a fantastic step in our road through potty training.",5

All Boy Baby Wagon,Sent this item as a gift and my friend was thrilled when she received it. Very cute stuff.,5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I purchased this for my grandson to use when he visits.  It's okay when using it for a small child, but as he has  grown, we find that it is a little snug and he is small for his age at 2 1/2.  The concept is great and stores compactly.  I think it would be great when travelling or when going out to eat.  It's certainly more sanitary to place your child in this seat and use the attachable tray, rather than placing him in a restaurant supplied highchair or booster seat and using the common table. Even with the chair being a little on the small side, I would definitely advise purchasing this chair for the occasional use.",4
Fisher-Price Cheer for Me Potty,"I really like this potty for my child.  The reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the tissue holder was not really useful and could have been exchanged for a better feature.  Overall, I would recommend it as my child loves it and it has made the potty training experience a bit easier.",4

Baby Trend Triplet Stroller in Navy,"I am the mother of triplets.  This stroller is a lifesaver.  For those of you who want this for older children be prepared for it to be heavy because  you are putting 3 20+ pound kids in.  I handles nicely and once I learned how to fold it, there was no problem.  There are some complaints of it being to bit.  Well, it's a triplet stroller.  I love it, recomend it and its still going strong.",5
Elegant Baby Colorful Feeding Set - Blue,This is my favorite feeding set for my 8-month-old daughter.  She absolutely LOVES the spoon (because it is very soft and bendable) and I love the bowl (because it has a suction cup that keeps her from flinging it off the table).  I'm thinking of buying a second set.,5

Skip Hop Alphabet Zoo Mega Play Mat,"I love the look and functionality of this mat BUT I will be returning it.  The fillers used to make the mat padded comes out of the fabric when my son moves around on the mat.  I noticed the white thread/fiber balls all over the mat the first time we used it and more kept coming out as we use it.  My son almost ingested one of the thread/fiber balls and the fibers can definitely be inhaled by a baby while on tummy time or rolling around in this mat.  I'm really disappointed since this is the best looking play mat I've seen, but it's just not safe for my 4 month old son or any baby!",2
"Eddie Bauer - Teddy Bear Wall Decals, Brown",My baby loves them. He enjoys looking and touching the bears. they are perfect :). You can easily make their room unique by using such wall stickers.,5
Colorado Tote,I love this bag!  There is plenty of room in it to fit all my little one's stuff (and I like to overpack).I really like the plastic pouch inside.  It has come in handy several times when she has had accidents and we need somewhere to put wet clothes.At first I wondered why the strap had velcro on it.  I was excited to discover that you can unclip and unvelcro it and attach it to the handle of your stroller!  This is my favorite thing about the bag!  It is very comfortable to carry too.  I am so glad I picked it because it is great!,5
iBaby M3 Baby monitor for iPhone,"This is a simple and elegant looking baby monitor that held a lot of promise. However, after testing it for a while I&#8217;ve concluded that it&#8217;s far from being worth the investment. It is hard to setup and use reliably, and its features are subpar compared to other similar baby monitors.The setup was extremely difficult. The instructions are not very clear, and it took me a while, and many false starts, to figure out exactly how to get it going.The monitor relies on connecting to the manufacturer&#8217;s network and maintaining this connection for proper use. Unfortunately the network connection was very unreliable, and very frequently I was unable to connect to the monitor.The picture quality is decent, but certainly not nearly as good as these devices have you believe from the advertising stills. It&#8217;s on par with some other low-end baby monitors that I&#8217;ve used and tested.The monitor comes with two-way audio, but there was too much delay with the audio signal and the sound was all but incomprehensible. This was definitely one of the monitor&#8217;s weakest features.A few good things that I can say about this baby monitor concern its design. It is very creatively designed, and it is fairly light and portable. It comes with a simple charging base, but the monitor is a bit too loose when placed there.IP cameras are notoriously finicky and hard to use devices. I have dealt with several over the years, and have invariably been frustrated with all of them. This is why my expectations for this baby monitor were fairly low, but even so it did not live up to my expectations. It is hard to use, unreliable, and both the picture and the audio quality are subpar. IP baby monitors are a great idea in principle, but in practice they are mostly difficult to use. I would recommend that you check out instead one of the directly connected baby video monitors with its own included remote video screen. Those are not nearly as versatile, but they are certainly very reliable.",2

"Petunia Pickle Bottom Boxy Backpack Convertible Diaper Bag, Holiday In The Hague","We bought this bag because we wanted something versatile, durable and of course ""cute"". It met all of those standards, but also had some things about it we didn't like.- When you have a lot in here (diapers, wipes, extra pair of clothes, diaper cream, etc.), it can weight the bag down a lot, causing the straps to really hurt your shoulders. My suggestion would be for PPB to make a style with cushions for the straps.- The bag is easy to wipe clean, but the inside is very difficult to get completely clean, because the material is not removable. Some of the pieces are, but not everything. We were on a flight back home to visit family last year and one of our daughters bottles spilled inside of the bag - we tried everything we could to clean it out, but it always had a stench after that. Also, the company tells you not to put it in the washer.- Our bag was left outside by our Nanny (probably for about 2 days, I'm guessing) and turned yellow from the sun. The material did not do well, and was ruined; thus we had to throw away a $180 bag!!!! I was pretty upset about this... The ""easy to wipe clean"" feature sounds like something I will be able to sacrifice for our next purchase.",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"I bought 4 Lamaze toys based on their 5 stars reviews, Buzz the Bug, Freddie the Firefly, Mortimer the Moose, and Jacques the Peacock. They are all beautiful and good quality and all have teething rings, squeakers, crinkles, and rattles. BUT to be honest Jacques the Peacock beats them all so easily, my baby only cares about jack. When she was born I show her the High contrast Black and White dots on jack's wings, and she was so mesmerized for several minutes.. While I agree that all Lamaze baby products are good and worth buying, but I think 1 or 2 is enough.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","we LOVE the skip hop zoo pack!! my son got it from us for his 2nd birthday. he absolutely LOVES carrying it around, putting things in to it, taking things out of it, and playing with it when he's not wearing it.it's the perfect size for munchkins; has enough space for travel wipes, a few diapers, and a couple toys. not too big, so it's easier to make sure that the load is appropriate for what your child can handle to carry.straps have plenty of &#34;growing room&#34; in them, so i expect i'll get a good few years out of it.there is a place inside to write your child's name, and it's decent sized (his name has 12 letters in it, i was able to write it with a standard sharpie).the zippers have larger sized pulls on them, which makes it easy for tiny hands to open and close the pockets.there is a special place for a sippy cup, however, we've noticed that putting a cup there throws our guy a little off-balance. i'm not sure that there is a way to fix that (aside from putting a sippy cup on the other side too) so, since i have no solution, i did not take any marks off. i'm sure that as he gets bigger, we will be able to use this.we get A LOT of compliments on it, as well!! this company DEFINITELY had toddlers in mind!",5

"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack","I have enjoyed using Dr. Brown's bottles for our daughter.  People thought I was crazy when I bought them, but I have stuck with them and have not had a baby that spits up like others.  A fellow baby at daycare uses Avent and he spits up all day long!  Our little baby doesn't spit up hardly at all.  My husband asked one time why our baby doesn't spit up that much...I told him, thankfully it was due to the bottles!Our baby still has some gas problems but I think that is related to her drinking so fast when she wakes up and is so hungry along with the fact that she has an umbilical hernia and I think that bothers her digestion.The cleaning is not that difficult with these bottles and is worth it for your child.  I usually put the bottles and the tubes on the top rack in the dishwasher and then put the rings and the rubber part in the bottom of a dishwasher basket with the nipples in the top part.  No problems!The only difficulty I have with these bottles is having to explain to others how to use them.  When we take her to nursery at church, the older ladies don't know how to use them and I have to explain it to them.  That is the only drawback is that it takes a lot of explaining to others how to use it.Also we have no leaking because we take the nipple and coller off to warm the bottle.  I dont' have leakage in the diaper bag either as I sit them upright in the pockets inside.  I rarely use the disks anymore.",5

thinkbaby Sippy Cup or Bottle Conversion Kit,"I recently bought this cup because I was having trouble transition my toddler from a bottle to a cup.  We tried everything from plastic cups to silicone cup tops and nothing seemed to work.  As a last attempt I bought the thinkbaby cup.  My daughter loves it so much she even calls it her """"baba.""""  It has a silicone top and I think would probably make it pretty easy to confuse baby into thinking it is actually her bottle.  The only complaint I have is that the spout seems to collapse ( but quickly reforms itself) so it hasnt seemed to be much of a problem.  I would say BUY THIS PRODUCT if your child seems to not like any other cup.  Besides being a little on the expensive side for a cup I would highly suggest it to friends and family!  Actually I already have! =)",5

I also have the large sleep sheep and that just never worked for her here and there when she slept with me because i fall right to sleep with the sleep sheep myself.every child is gonna be different with what sleep system works but i do recomend this.Unfortunately mine came with partially dead batteries so i thought it was broken since the buttons and noises werent workign right until i had changed those.",5
Boppy Pregnancy Wedge with Cotton Slipcover,"Not only has this helped me sleep better at night, I've also noticed that since I started using the Comfort Wedge, the stretch marks on my stomach have stopped growing even though my belly hasn't!

It also has a washable slipcover, which is nice too.",5
Natural Organic Cotton Washable Nursing Pads-6pk [Baby Product],"Found these at the Babies R Us store north of Pittsburgh. I was really hopeful that these would work well. They're very soft, very comfortable, and reasonably priced... They'd be perfect, if only they were absorbent enough to prevent leaks! I can get away with wearing these during the day if I'm nursing my daughter frequently, but I have leaked through them every time she slept a six-hour stretch overnight. Even during the day, if I'm pumping or nursing on one side, the other side can leak right through the pad in a matter of minutes. I won't even take the chance of wearing them in public. So they haven't been terribly useful for me. I'm using disposable nursing pads for now.",2
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"We bought this for our son when he was 3 months old.  He is now 5 months old and still loves it just as much as the first day he was in it.  I have it in the kitchen and he happily plays in it in the morning while I make breakfast and then again at night while I make dinner.  He absolutely loves it.  He probably would stay in it all day if I let him.  We also have the triple fun exersaucer and he only plays in that for 5 minutes before he wants out of it.  Wish I would have purchased the jumperoo first and never even bought the exersaucer.* A little update (January 2, 2008):  My son is now 10 months old and still loves the Jumperoo (Although we are nearing the end of the Jumperoo days, since he would much rather be on the move than restrained in anything now), but he did grow to love the exersaucer as well.  Both were excellent purchases and I would recommend both.  The Jumperoo does not have a lot of activities on it, but it provides a lot of fun in that it allows the baby to bounce and that's what babies love to do as infants.  There are two settings for the music--one that plays continuously and one mode that only plays when the baby bounces.  The exersaucer has many more activities on it, but doesn't provide the same bouncing motion as the jumperoo.  As I said both were excellent purchases and I have recommended both to friends and family.  Hope this helps.",5
Imse Vimse Flushable Liner - 200 count (Baby),"I used these for a long time and they're big and effective, but since they're rectangular they have to fold in on themselves.

"green sprouts 3-12 Months Daily Waterproof Absorbent Bib, Boy, 7 Pack","I purchased these bibs after buying the regular Green Sprouts bibs with the velcro closure.  I like the that quality and waterproof feature of these bibs.  They are absorbent and still protect the childs clothing.  However, the cannot under any circumstances be used for anything other than feeding and then immediately removed.The strap that goes around the child's neck is very stretchy and I already have seen my infant pull the bib out and let it go.  When she lets it go it twists and crosses the stretchy strap.  Too many twists and this bib could definitely be choking your child.  Stay with the Green Sprouts classic bibs with the velcro closure at the back.If I could make a suggestion to the manufacturer it would be to put the velcro closure on the side to help avoid baby's neck from getting scratched by the bib.",1

Combi Helio DX Lightweight Stroller in Ember/Wasabi,"I can't say enough about how much I like this stroller.  My last stroller was very expensive, and very heavy.  I finally got sick of hauling it in and out of the car, and having it take up almost the entire back of my SUV.  This Combi stroller takes up a fraction of the space and is so light!  My 1 yr old son who is 24 lbs is very comfortable in it - he has plenty of growing room and he loves to keep his feet up on the cross bar.  The 2 holders on this bar for his drink or snacks is very helpful. I did add a $10 buggy buddy to hold my drinks, keys, etc in the back.  A plastic, fixed parent try does not work on this Combi because it would restrict how tightly it folds up.  The basket underneath is not huge, but not super tiny either.  The stroller is stable enough that I hang the diaper bag over the handle bars anyways.This is a great stroller if you are looking for the best comfort you can get in a minimal lightweight size.  Steering is not perfect, but 10X better than a cheap umbrella stroller.  The steering is as good as my old $300 Britax stroller anyways.",5
"Boon Flair Seat Pad, Brown","This high chair is fantastic, the pad highly functional, but this is not the same color as it looks in the pics.Color: We bought the ""Chocolate"".  Our looks more like an Army Green color.  It's hard to explain, but whatever it is, it's not brown. Very light brown with a green tint maybe?  Almost looks camoflage.  Guess it still beats the orange.Functionality: As has been mentioned, this pad is highly functional, very cool design, and the ""chocolate"" color is very good at hiding stains, washable, wipable etc.",3

Dermo-Cleansing 500ml. (16.90 FL OZ),"Us moms want the best for our little ones and that doesn&#8217;t stop at how we keep our baby clean. Mustela Bebe Dermo-Cleansing is a cleansing gel for hair and body that is soap-free and does not sting babies eyes. It softens skin and helps soothe irritation with its formula containing vitamin B5.This is a hypoallergenic cleanser which minimizes the risk of allergic reactions (which is something I love) and compensates for the drying effect of hard water with its super-fatted agents (coconut derivatives). Mmmm coconut!This is a gel texture although the lathering is perfect. It&#8217;s not to thin where it looks like you haven&#8217;t put any soap on the baby yet it&#8217;s not too foamy. It&#8217;s the perfect &#8220;in between&#8221;.It&#8217;s easy to use! Put a bit in the palm of your hands, lather babies hair and body, rinse and dry baby off. I do like the smell of this. It reminds me of when I was younger, at the beach with all the smells of everyone wearing sunscreen.This product can be used from birth, onwards. The value for a 750ml bottle is approximately $22.00 USD.",4

You don't even notice the tape at all. Overall, I'm happy...especially because her room looks so cute with them!! I posted a few pics.",4
Cosco Summit High Back Booster Seat - Mocha,"I absolutely hate this carseat. The only reason I purshased it was b/c consumer reports recommended it. I am all about safety when it comes to carseats. If I was ever in a car accident and my child sustained any injuries I need to know the carseat was correctly installed and my child was properly restrained or I would feel and be responsible.My car is not equipped with the latch system so I use the center lap belt and I can not get this carseat in tight nor my husband. It moves well over an inch from side to side. Even the tether strap is impossible to get tight. This carseat does not seem safe to me at all. I have read many of the other reviews and received some pointers on installation such as changing the recline position. I will definatly try these. But let me say thisNO CARSEAT SHOULD BE DIFFICULT TO INSTALL!!!!I shouldn't have to do additional research to install this carseat.I also do not like the """"puzzle"""" belt for belting my child in. What purpose does that serve other then a hassle. It's also hard to get the belt snug against my child. The carseat itself is huge nobody else has room to sit in the backseat of my honda civic with my child. The cupholder doesn't seem to be appropriatly placed nor the head rest. My child ends up falling asleep with her head next to the side of her body.BUY BRITAX!!!",1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","Like the title of my review suggests, this is a great stroller but is a pain in the rear to fold! I like that it is lightweight, very durable, has a good amount of storage on the bottom, and that the child in the rear can get up or sit down while riding on this. What I don't like is that it is hard to fold! I still have no idea how I fold it, when I do get it to fold (I've managed to do it twice). In fact, I've gotten so annoyed of it before that I've  put it in my SUV without folding it before! Anyway, perfect in all other ways except the inconvenience I mentioned.",4
Medela Symphony Double Pumping System,"You may be wondering that.Most of the other Medela pumps have little nubs that you attach the tubing to, and that's how the pumping action works.  The air is sucked through the tubes, into the shield, and there you go.The Symphony is a ""hospital grade"" breast pump, but what's more, it's also safe for sharing, which is why some workplaces have them.  Instead of having air sucked directly through the machine, it has these two pistons at the top, and those pistons, as they go up and down, are responsible for the suction.  But to convert an up and down piston motion into sucking, you need a special attachment.  THAT's what's specific to this kit vs the other medela kits that might  include tubing and shields and bottles.  If you don't have those attachments, you cannot connect to the symphony, end of story.So this is a good kit.  But you only need one like this since the Symphony specific parts do not get dirty and don't need to be washed really.  Once you have this, if you want more shields and bottles, you can buy one of many other medela kits that don't include the extra symphony parts.That said, this kit includes everything you need to pump with the symphony.  You don't need anything else.  But as an aside it does not include nipples for the bottles.  Not that it needs to - just saying if you are buying this kit to grab and go somewhere and then want to give the bottles for feeding, you need nipples for the bottles or you need other bottles.  Aside from that, this includes everything you need and you don't need anything more.If you are buying this to pump at work, I would highly recommend the medela quick clean wipes, which lets you clean all the pumping parts without a sink - just a quick wipe down, so you can toss them back into your bag and be good to go.  http://www.amazon.com/Quick-Clean-Breastpump-Accessory-Wipes/dp/B000CCXLNE",5

"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","We received this as a gift after registering the swing on Amazon.  Though it's a bit on the pricey side for a baby swing, the overall reviews seemed positive.  Our baby is now 6 months old but this has been a life saver for us from the day he was born.  My baby loves to be carried to sleep but the swing never failed to do it for us whenever we wanted to rest our arms.  We had the swing positioned in the dining room with us so we would just put him in there during dinner time.  Additionally the music is very soothing and there are different swing settings you can set the speed to.  I have recommended this same swing to all my preggo friends.  One of the must-haves you need to put on your registry!",5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I am not impressed with the Diaper Dekor...I received it as a shower gift with a box of refill liners (cost of refills - $20).

There is nothing wrong with that, but you would be just as well off using a regular trash can with a lid.",2

NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"This is a decent monitor for the price. What was surprising was the amount of ""white"" or ""buzz"" noise at its lowest volume levels. Many reviewers specifically said this was a very quiet monitor. I tend to disagree. The way around it was to put the setting on ""voice-activated"". This eliminates the white noise until it picks up the babies voice. Downside to this feature selections is a couple: 1. First second of words or noise is lost due to the handheld having to kick back ""on"". 2. It doesn't allow you to just hear if the baby is stirring around and it doesn't pick up slight mumbling or low noises/words coming from the baby.Lastly, I was surprised how bright the lights were. We have to face the monitor away as it creates a light almost as bright as a nightlight. There are two lights- the green connection light to the base and the red battery/electrical light. The red light is the one that glows like a beacon.Overall, its a decent monitor for the money. I wouldnt pay full retail price on it. I have still yet to determine the life of battery between charges. That would probably change my review up or down depending on hours of time between charges.UPDATE: after a year of this product, I really dont care for it. It ""pops"" and ""crackles"" for no reason and at random times. Sometimes its when trying to go to bed and forces us to turn it off (hence defeating the purpose of having one).I would not recommend this one and put some extra money in for a nicer one.",1

My sister-in-law is living with us and has two dogs, one is a great dane, and I don't want them running all over the house for obvious reasons, including the fact that I have an older basset hound whose not interested in playing with her dogs.This gate has been very effective, and I find it easy to use. It's easy to adjust the size of gate by just unscrewing rod ends. The gate is spring loaded so it's easy to fit into most opening, and with the soft rubber tips it won't damage your walls. Or you can do like I do, so I don't have to climb over them or take them in and out I opened them bigger then the opening and lean them in place.",5

"Cosco Flat-Fold High Chair, Zambia","I purchased this for when our grandchildren come to visit.  It works perfectly, and stores easily.  You can't beat it, for the price.",5
"Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman, Black/Green Chenille","Wife:  I was very excited about the build, color and fashion of this glider and thought it was great! My 6ft tall husband thought it was a little small for him, but we weren't too bothered by that because I would mostly be using it to nurse. Unfortunately, when I started using the glider regularly - I noticed it made my bum go numb after about 20minutes :(  It just doesn't have enough cushion, especially for a mom who just delivered a child!  We're probably going spend the money on a recliner - it's unfortunate that we wasted $150 on this glider.",2
Safety 1st High-Def Digital Monitor,"We're entirely satisfied with this monitor. NO problems with interference from cordless phones & wireless networks. The sound quality is very good- there's a bit of high-pitched hiss, but (as others have noted) we can hear the clock ticking in our daughter's room. The use of (easily-replaceable) AAA rechargeables is appreciated.",5
"Britax 2014 B-Agile and B-Safe Travel System, Red","Excelent travel system.... Light, easy yo carry, fold and unfold. I highly recomend it. It is a ver y good product.",5
Bright Starts Soothing Safari Mobile,"When i first got this i was really excited about it. my 3 month old baby loves it and so is my 2 yr old girl. one time I left my 3 month old on the crib, she was admiring the mobile. then my 2 yr old got a chair and reach out for the mobile she must have got curious at the blue button before the head of the mobile and press it. the head of the mobile immediately got ejected from the curved part of the toy and fell on the crib. thank god my 3 month old baby was not directly under the mobile.",1
Boys Skeleton Sweatshirt Hoodie M,,5
Graco Ultra Clear Vibe Monitor,"My husband purchased this within the first few days of our baby coming home. My son is now 18 months old and though we've used it for that long just fine.  I find that the quality is not that great.  It gets way too much interference  and the static sound is ear piercing and has more then once actually woken the baby up from a nap.  There were also times when it would make an extremely loud static sound a few times in the middle of the night.  If it were $10 I could justify it, but for what my husband paid for it at babies r us for the retail price I'm sure.. It was a huge dissappontment. I am finally just going to garbage it and get another monitor that actually works!",2
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",A must if you plan to pump for any length of time! Fits really well and easy to use. Can't believe I ever got along without it.,5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","These are comfortable nursing pads. I have some different ones that I received as a gift that have one side that is water proof, which these don't have. The plus side is that these are slightly less noticeable under bras/shirts, but the downside is that you could leak through these.",4
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!",I purchased these because I love Aden & anais products but I ended up returning these.. First of all I got two elephant ones and none of the butterfly ones and the only reason I chose this design was because I really liked the butterfly one. Secondly when I opened them the quality looked and felt much cheaper then the ones I got at Banies R Us so was not happy with this purchase.,3
Sassy: Baby Food Nursers 4oz - 2pk(Green) [Baby Product],"I bought these for my daughter. She says, they are an awesome bottle. I can remember using these 22 years ago. They are hard to find in the regular stores. I would buy these again.",4
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster &amp; Travel Bag - Green,This product is ideal!  It gives toddlers that little boost they need to sit up just a little bit higher at the table so they can eat comfortably.  It's very easy to clean and transport from one chair to another.  And it's indestructible - there are no pieces or straps to wear out or break.,5
Medela Swing Breastpump,It is the best. my wife uses two times a day at least and love it. it is a highly recommended product,5
"Evenflo Big Kid AMP No Back Booster Car Seat, Red","This is good for a backless booster. We use it for my 5-year-old (45"" 41 lbs) when we fly as it is just smaller to lug around with everything else. It is very easy to use. I like the seat belt adjuster strap - helps me get the shoulder belt in the correct position. She also likes the cup holder (I like that there are two - so she can share one with her sister, and that they are flexible - so they hold juice boxes, etc). It's easy to clean - just wipe down.The things I don't like are just because it's backless - she slumps really badly if she falls asleep in it, no head protection in a crash.If you're looking for a backless, I highly recommend it.",4
"Dream On Me 3&quot; Rounded Corner Playard Mattress, White/Brown","Not to firm at all. Bought 3 of these, one for each grandchild and one for my house. Makes a nice place to sleep in the play and pack.",5
"Mumi&amp;Bubi Solids Starter Kit, 42 x 1oz Cubes In Two Compact Baby Food Freezer Storage Trays, Plus Free e-Recipes","Just like the product description, these are super compact since they are nice and flat and easy to pop out the frozen goods.  If frozen pureed food that I made didn't push out easily, a slow stream of water on the back side for just 5 seconds helped immediately.  Make sure you don't over fill the pods to insure tight closure of top. Each pod fits a tablespoon and a half of pureed food.",5
"timi &amp; leslie 2 in 1 Backpack Diaper Bag, Zoey Brown",Description of this diaper  bag is right on!  Very easy to convert to any style and the colors are great!,5
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum",We absolutley love this car seat!!! I love that fact that I can keep my little guy rear facing until 45 lbs! I recommend this seat tl all my friends enough have little ones!! If we have another kid we will definitely be buying another one!!!!,5
Pacifier - Wubbanub Infant Plush Pacifier - Turtle,"Our daughter is obsessed with her wubba. In fact so, we now have 3 of them for all areas of the house. I know they are a bit pricey for a pacifier, but worth every penny. She can even find it at night in her crib easily to self soothe!",5
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,These outlet plugs are a must have for every home with small children. They are sturdy enough that they cannot be pulled out easily.,5
"Medela Slow Flow Wide Base Nipple, 3pk/0-4 months","The product itself is great! So I give that five stars. Unfortunately, I had ordered three packs of the slow flow nipples and ended up getting one pack of that kind and two packs of the medium flow nipples, which wouldn't work for my little guy. I returned them about three weeks ago and am still waiting for a refund.",5
GumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Pack,"My son was given a GumDrop Paci at our local children's hospital after undergoing surgery.  He took to it immediately and seemed very calmed by the vanilla scent.  After using it for a week in the hospital, he no longer cares for his other pacis.  The pacifier is very soft and fits to his face without leaving marks.  It is one piece construction and does not get filled with soap or water when washed.  My only wish is that the vanilla scent came in multiple colors.",5
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,Perfect!  Better than expected!  Looks great and better quality than expected for the price!Love the wipe-able surface and length is wonderful!,4
"The First Years Compass Pathway B570 Adjustable Booster Seat, Black and Khaki","So far so good, and kid can get herself in and out on her own.  Adjustable armrests are convenient for getting in & out, and I assume adjustable head/neck will be helpful as she gets taller.  Great that it has the anchor so that it doesn't need to be strapped down when no kid in it.",5
"NUK Silicone Orthodontic Nipples, Size 1, Slow, 2 Pack",Not much to say about the replacement nipples. My EBF daughter takes expressed milk from a bottle great with these. No problems switching between breast and bottle.,5
"Playtex Lil' Gripper/Anytime 9 Ounce Straw Cup, 2 Count, Colors May Vary","Once your baby figures out straws this is an amazing sippee.  My little one is still figuring out how to tip the cup, so the straw is perfect for her.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","Born Free 9-Ounce Wide Neck BornFree Bottles Twin PackAfter researching BPA free items, I decided to attempt to switch my 4 month old from Avent Wide bottles to the Born Free bottles.  The nipples are VERY similiar, though a little softer.  I have had no issues with them closing and have been very happy with the bottles.  My daughter transitioned very well to them.  Appears that they are a pretty popular item as I can't buy them in the stores now in my town.  I would highly recommend to any new mom (or old moms for that matter).  If anything, they provide a little piece of mind.",5
ProudBody Pregnancy Belly Painting Kit,"The paint looks great, until it dries. It chips and looks horrible. It takes forever to apply as well because the paint doesn't want to stay on the skin. I tried painting a pumpkin for halloween. After 4 hours of painting, it looked great, until it dried and began flaking...",1
Lamaze Octotunes Musical Toy,This colorful octopus is great for entertaining the little tike in your family. The music is made by squeezing the tentacles. The little tikes will have trouble on their own since it takes a good squeeze to produce the sound. Colorful and larger than I asuumed when I saw the photo on the web.,3
Tommee Tippee Stage 1 Chewther (Colors May Vary),i would not recommend this product. It made my daughter throw up after only a few chews. She could have choked on it with this stupid thing still in her mouth.,1
Thermos Unbreakable Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulation Funtainer Food Jar (Sprinkles),"I like it very much, except the expensive price.The color and pattern are my favorite.If a little cheaper, I will buy again.",5
"American Baby Company Organic Embroidered Receiving Blanket, Mocha","I put this on my baby registry for my 1st pregnancy and was pleased to receive it. The blanket is very, very soft, and no the teddy bear is not scratchy, rough, or a bother at all. It is a nice size for swaddling, draping, etc. The fabric has a good bit of stretch to it.I really love the weight of this blanket. It is a nice extra layer for colder weather, but light enough to be usable during warm weather (we are in Mississippi - HOT summers, and near 100% humidity is very common). Also, it folds up well to fit in a diaper bag without taking up too much space, unlike bulkier blankets.My daughter just turned 3, and this blanket looks every bit as beautiful as when she was a newborn. It has been well used, loved, and washed, and is still going strong. Our second girl is due soon, so it will be going through round two, and I have no doubts that it will hold up just as well this time around.This product is highly recommended, especially for the price. Also, I have to say I love the color - a nice, calm, natural looking, brown. I hated pink even before I had a baby girl. No matter what you say, or whether people know your preferences, when you have a girl, the pink comes rolling in. This is a much-welcomed change of scenery, and a beautiful gift for any baby.",5
"Summer Infant ComfortMe Wearable Blanket, Happy Floral, Large","If you have a long baby, this won't last you very long but you will love it while it does.  My 8 month old has outgrown the length on the large size at around 28-29&#34; in length.  I love this style more than any other sleep sack so I'm going to be sad to see them go.  I love that this has some sleeve because I worry less about my daughter getting cold arms.  These zip so much easier and cover much better than most sleep sacks on the market.",5
Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,"fit fine, looked good. but it couldn't handle a 2 yr. old. The outside became torn and shredded quickly, I would recommend only with a very good waterproof fitted sheet but alone it just doesn't hold up well at all.",2
Sesame Street Framed Friends Green Folding Travel Potty Seat,We bought this seat to take with us in case our little boy needed to use the potty in public.  If you install it properly (with the front edge slightly over the edge of the toilet seat) it doesn't seem to have any problems.  My son has been using this for 5 months when we are out and about and has had none of the problems mentioned from other reviewers.  It does bow slightly but not enough to have him fall in (he weighs 32lbs).  I like that the parts that touch the toilet seat all fold together reducing the need to clean/sanitize it right there in the public loo with a toddler at your feet.,4
"Bloom Fresco Contemporary Baby Chair, Seat Pad With Harness Set (Large+Small Pads) Coconut White (Leatherette)","This is the perfect insert for out Bloom Loft Chair (see my review).  The materials are sturdy and well crafted.  I love the fact that it comes with the two differently sized inserts; this allows your child to grow into the chair, not out of it.  And the style; WOW, the gold looks so cool with the super-shiny black chair; there's absolutely NOTHING else like it!",5
"Naturepedic Organic Cotton Crib Fitted Sheet, Ivory","I'm not sure if the reviewers who were complaining about the size received the same item I did, but the sheet I received fit the standard crib sized mattress perfectly.",5
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","Excellent product, easy to set up, easy to fold and keeps your little ones from getting into trouble. My grandson loves being in his play yard and I can get something accomplished.",5
"Thirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boy",I use these for my exclusivley breastfed babies soiled bum. The terry side grabs and cleans while the fleece side gently wipes any residue away. Works great and is gently on babies bum! The size is slightly bigger than the wash cloths you use for bath time. I wash these every other day and they've held up really well! I sun dry them so they're stain free so far. Will update when she starts eating solids.,5
Graco Digital imonitor Mini Baby Monitor in White,I am very glad with this purchase.  Paid less than $50 so this is a great deal.  Cannot vouch for the coverage distance but I have no interference or signal-dropping problems as I have only used this indoor.  The rechargeable stand and the small size are great features.,4
bumGenius One-Size Cloth Diaper Twilight,"Our baby is 8 months old, and our BG 3.0's are still going strong.  The velcro is starting to lose its stickiness around the edges, but we haven't had any problems with the tabs coming off.  When people find out we are using cloth diapers, they are shocked and ask ""Why bother? Isn't it a hassle?"", but when I show them how our BG's work (and how cute they are), they are always impressed and want to get some for themselves or someone they know.",4
The First Years Learning Curve Floating Stars Teether,"I put this in the fridge shortly after receiving it as a shower gift.  Ok, It was in the fridge for a few months while waiting for my son to grow old enough to grasp things.  When I took it out, it was flat.  I don't know what happened to all the liquid that's supposed to be in it, but it mysteriously disappeared.",1
Infantino Squeeze Station,"I got this for my three kids so that I can make them there own food pouches. I was having to shell out $1.49 per pouch for three kids twice a day that added up to $62.59 plus tax in one week. Plus, they could only have what some tech in big corporation decides they should get. Now, my kids get to fun fun thinking up new combinations of fruits and veggies. But they eat mostly applesauce flavored with kool-aide liquids. Anything that gets my kids to eat more healthy and less candy is great in my book. Bought in combination with Infantino 50 Count Squeeze Pouches.",4
Sony 900 MHz BabyCall Sound-Sensor Nursery Monitor (Baby Call),"I don't normally write reviews, good or bad, but this product has annoyed me from day 1. My son is now 2 and we were using it up until a few weeks ago but it was always getting interference and the unit would just beep in our room all the time. At first I considered the number of walls if had to go through (2 at most) and the distance between rooms, but then I realized if I need a baby monitor, my child is obviously not going to be in the same room or even necessairly in the next room. Do not spend money on this unless you plan on putting the monitor in the same, or at least, the next room that is the only way it will work.",1
Eco Sprout Detergent 48 oz. - Lavender / Chamomile,"It smells wonderful, gets my cloth diapers clean, and for a great price. I will definitely be buying it again.",5
Diono Radian Angle Adjuster,I ordered to be safe but didnt end up using and was too expensive to return..  I suggest you order carseat 1st then decide if you need it.,1
Philips Avent Single Electric Comfort Breast Pump,I like it and really need it when I back to work.But my son don't like the new natural nipple.The cushion is not that strong. If I can easily purchase the spare part will be perfect.,4
"Kidz Delight Smooth Touch Smart Phone, Black Display",I purchased this item because my Granddaughter likes to walk around with a cellphone in her hand.  She likes to try and dial numbers so I got this for her so she could do her own thing......,5
Evenflo Exersaucer Smartsteps Jump &amp; Go,Before buying a jumper we tried the jumperoo at the store...my baby hated it. It was so bulky that my baby couldn't do anything but cry. when she tried this jumper her eyes lit up and started jumping like it was second nature. She absolutely loves the toy in the front as well. She uses it when she is not jumping. I absolutely recommend this.,5
Britax Marathon in Ashley Floral,"We bought this car seat after originally buying a Graco that was later recalled. Although it was pricey it's been worth every dime. My son is three years old now and is tall for his age but he still fits perfectly into this seat. It's easy to clean and is a breeze to install. In fact, if you have the LATCH system this car seat takes less than a minute to install. We bought the Britax Companion for our new little one because it was the safest one on the market at the time but at 6 months old it's already too small for her! We're going to get another Marathon for her and will install it rear-facing for now and after she's 20lbs/1yr old will turn around.",5
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundle Me, Graphite",Our son has been fussy since he was 2 weeks old and having the Bunde Me in his infant carrier has been wonderful. The minute we get him into the seat he calms down with the warmth of the Bundle Me around him. We've even put him in it at home just to calm him down!,5
"Skip Hop Dunks Stacking Bath Toy, Blue, Green, Yellow",My 12 month old son LOVES these bath toys.  They are perfect to fill and rinse him with one while he plays with the others.  He loves to play with them when he's not even taking a bath.  They spin on the floor and he loves to spin them around.  I also like a bath toy that isn't squirty because of concern about them developing mold on the inside.,5
Medela One-Piece Breastshield w/ Valve and Membrane,"This replacement piece works better than the original that came with my pump. It is an excellent value, fits with the hoses and bottles perfectly, and has better suction.",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,"Our 5 month old can sit up unassisted, but our non-skid bathtub prevents us from using the infant seats that suction to the bottom of the tub. The Snug Tub is VERY slippery and dangerous for her right now- moreso than just sitting her in the regular tub!  We are currently using the infant seat tub placed INSIDE the Snug Tub.  Snug Tub will probably be safer and appropriate for her when she is about 8 or 9 months old.",3
Summer Infant Deluxe Day &amp; Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 2.5&quot; Screen - Pink,"I purchased this monitor some time ago and it worked fine (though it buzzed all the time...we just got used to it).However, after reading other reviews mentioning security issues with the monitor channels showing other neighboring babies, I thought I would check my other channel.  Needless to say, I was horrified to see our neighbors little boy sleeping soundly on the other channel!  After calling Summer Infant, they confirmed that if I can see them, they can see us too!  We have the monitor set up to see our daughter's entire room and it runs 24/7, so when we go to tuck her in at night (in our pajamas), or anything else throughout the day, our neighbors have been able to see and hear everything!  Summer realizes this is a ""problem"", so they offered to replace my monitor with the Secure baby monitor at no cost.I WOULD NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT as anyone with the same monitor can also see yours.",1
Van Goat Baby Einstein Van Gogh Puppet,I was very disappointed that something with the Baby Einstein brand would be made so cheaply. I could have made this myself and it would have been nicer.,2
Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"This snap n go is so fabulous i can hardly put it into words!!! It is so lightweight, easy to maneuver, easy to fold and unfold. The basket is huge!! I used to use it when I went to the store (I'm too short to see over the baby if the carrier was placed on a shopping cart!) and it would fit milk, eggs, and anything else I was purchasing! The handle was a great height for me (5'0""). My baby just outgrew his infant carrier and I was so upset to have to store the snap n go in the attic waiting for #2. When shopping for a lightweight stroller one woman asked me what I wanted and I said, ""a snap n go with a seat!!!"". We got the large graco travel system and that stroller is awesome, but it weighs 30lbs!! The car seat did fit perfectly, but just for added safety I always used the straps. Hope this helped and good luck!!",5
"Evenflo Triumph Advance LX Convertible Car Seat, Harbortown",This car-seat was bought for my grandson...he never slept in his old one..always cried...Now he's comfortable and naps constantly!! Love it!,5
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze",This gate is great. easy to install.Very easy to open and close.we are impressed with this product.we had brought a wooden gate and the puppyhad chew it. this gate is metal.,5
Dwell Studio CHOCOLATE Dot CRIB SKIRT Toddler Bed Dust Ruffle,I was finally able to put this skirt on my crib and it looks great.  It matches the bumper pad and goes well with my current fitted sheet.  The nice thing about this skirt is that it will go with numerous other sheets that I purchase.,5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Mobile with Remote Control,"I got this for my daughter.  She tells me that this mobile was either broken when it arrived or broke within a day or two or being put on the crib.  She says it started making terrible noises - the motor appeared to have broken.  My daughter contacted Fisher-Price directly and they promised her a ""refund"" - only $25, much less than the actual cost.  She has received nothing thus far.  Very disappointing.  She has now purchased a Tiny Love mobile that she finds much higher quality.",1
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack, Lavender or Citrus",unless i wore it around my neck they were useless.my cat liked batting them around though so it was not a complete waste i guess :-),1
The First Years Learning Curve Floating Stars Teether,This teether had a strange chemical taste even after I washed it which wouldn't go away.  I decided to soak in distilled water overnight which didn't seem to help (just turned the whole toy a cloudy color).  It's in the garbage right now.,1
"LA Baby Commercial/Restaurant Wooden High Chair, Cherry",I have theses chairs for a while and they work out prefect. I wish they had shorter chairs to hide under the table. Other than that point I love these chairs and would recommend these to any one with children over the age of 1.,5
Hushamok Okoa Sustainable Beechwood Stand,"I admit that I was a little hesitant to order this product, both due to the unusual design and the relatively high cost. However, after looking at feedback and reviews online, I'm very glad I did purchase it. The stand is made from laminated beechwood and looks great. Very modern and sleek. It is also, despite what another reviewer on here said, quite easy to assemble with the provided hex wrench. We love the clean look of it and the fact that the company responded so quickly to our questions about whether the epoxy used in the laminate was non-toxic (company representative--I think it was the owner, actually--stated that the entire product is non-toxic and that the hammock fabric is organic and neither it nor the EVA foam insert are treated with any fire retardants). Our baby seems to love it, sleeping very well. Wish we had this with our first! And unlike another commenter, we have not noticed any wobble--the legs stay firmly on the floor, even on low-pile carpeting with the baby fussing in the hammock.",5
"Britax Marathon 70 Convertible Car Seat (Previous Version), Onyx",We have the older version of this car seat and bought this one for our new arrival. Cover is very easy to remove and wash and replace. I just stick it in the washer on cold gentle cycle with baby friendly soap and hang it to dry over night and put it back together in the morning and its ready to go again like new. Easy to adjust as the kiddies grow; no more removing straps or reinserting buckles and stuff. The back has an easy adjust handle that lets you slide the straps up and down with one hand! Worth the money for the easy and range of growth it has on it. 5lbs.(newborn)- 70lb(school age).,5
Carter's Animal Face Teething Bib (Yellow Duck),"This purchase was a gift. I had purchased for my son on this site before, and now for a friend's granddaughter.",5
Safety 1st Outlet Cover with Cord Shortener,not as easy to install as it should be for a baby product...it took 2 of us to install it (not simultaneouslyy),3
Simba Baby Safety Nail Cutter- Baby Safety Scissors-Manicure Accessory-Easy To Control than Fingernail Clipper-1 pc,"I was using a baby nail clipper and nail scissors I had gotten from my baby shower made by Safety First. What a joke! They were hard to use and didn't get a close cut at all. I was so afraid I'd cut my baby's fingers that my hands would shake just holding the clippers! The scissors barely took any of the nail off because the blades were so thick.I bought the Simba scissors out of desperation as baby started scratching her face badly. They don't look like much when you get them, but they're the best! You get a close cut to the nailbed without cutting baby's finger tip! The scissors cut so easily it was like magic! No effort at all to cut through the nail. Trust me! Just get these scissors. They are a necessity in your baby grooming kit!",5
"American Baby Company Cotton Terry Flat Fitted Changing Pad Cover, Red","We bought two of these and am glad we did. We have a flat changing table, and most of the covers seem to be for curved ones. I didn't think I could find my color, but this company did have a purple option. Score! These wash pretty well, and if I were better with the stain stick I'm sure they would remain spotless (mine are not). Glad we have two so there's always something covering the table regardless of how big a mess we made on the last change.",4
'The Insulated Sippy' by Eco Vessel Insulated Stainless Steel Sippy Cup - 10 Oz - Hudson Blue - 10 oz - Container,"So far this sippy cup leaks a little bit.  My son doesn't use it much, so it's not a big deal.",3
Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress,"I have been very pleased with this product so far - the only reason I am giving 4 stars at this time is because our baby hasn't arrived yet to test it out.  I will update more later.There was no smell to the mattress when we opened the packaging (I read this complaint in some of the reviews), but we've also got plenty of time to let it air out before baby arrives.  It also felt very firm, so I feel confidant in using this with our baby.  The mattress fits nice and snug in our crib (Lolly & Me - Delaney crib) - no gaps at all in the corners.  I have yet to cover the mattress with anything, so I don't have an opinion yet on how crib sheets work with the square corners.  I feel like the protective outer covering will help extend the life of the mattress and make clean-up easier with any accidents.I am happy that I bought this mattress!  Can't wait for our little one to be here and try it out.",4
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra",The 2 drawbacks to this seat I've found is:1 - the release latch for the straps in the seat base is SO FAR up there that I really have to stretch my finger to reach it.2 - because my 3 year old is just at the start of allowed height/weight for the seat I really have to pull hard on the straps to tighten them enough.I had a Britax infant carrier & convertible car seat that I loved so I stayed with them and I'm still happy I did.  I love the ease of installation on this seat!,4
"Prince Lionheart Seat Neat, Black/Grey","My toddler uses a booster seat, and we recently purchased a new dining set that includes upholstered chairs. Risky, I know, but it was the look we wanted. Since so much of her food ends up around the edges of her booster seat, I knew we needed a way to protect the upholstery. It covers the seat of the chair well, and it is easy to wipe clean.The only drawback that I could see is that the mat doesn't secure directly to the chair. This is not an issue for us because our booster seat buckles to the chair and holds the mat in place. If you have a booster seat that just sits on the chair or is designed to grip the chair, I believe that it would slide around.",5
KidCo Outlet Plug Cover,"The mechanism to open the cover is pretty nice. I like that the spacious cover allows for bulkier plugs/cords. However, this item does not work on GFI outlets (the ones that have the little button(s) for resetting). I didn't see this anywhere on the product page, and by the time I read this on the box, my 1 year old twins had already gotten blueberry yogurt all over the cover, making it difficult to exchange. (If I missed this exclusion, I will edit my review.) I ended up using this on another outlet but am disappointed the product page was not specific about what types of hardware would not work with it.",3
"Safety 1st Table Edge Protector, Medium","I had the small version of the Safety 1st Table Edge Protector, and it was perfect.  I had a 30&#34; square table, and it pulled tight around the edges for a great fit.I now have a larger table (146&#34;), so I put the small protector in the attic and bought the medium size.  It's rated for 141&#34; and up.  And it is WAY WAY WAY too large for my 146&#34; table.  For this item to really work, it must fit tightly, and it simply does not.  Any table on the lower end of the rated measurement system will not work with this medium protector.  It was so loose that it hung off the long sides of the table.I know many people have different definitions of &#34;loose&#34;...but, please, take my word for it.  When I say it's loose, it is 100% complete unusable loose.I strongly recommend this product...if your table is in the 160&#34;-180&#34; range.",2
Moulin Roty Jeannot Rabbit 16&quot; Plush,My daughter got this bunny when we lived in France. She  loves her bunny! The bunny goes everywhere with her. He is so soft. He is jointed. I am writing this and my daughter is sleeping with her bunny. That bunny means the world to her.,5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll",We have a Baby Jogger City Elite stroller and our baby gets so bored and fussy in the stroller.  We got this so he would have some toys to play with and he really likes it and it is good quality.  It doesn't fit on this particular stroller very well though as there is nowhere for it to attach to.  We screwed it in really tight and it seems to work ok even though its not totally connected properly.,4

"Britax Pinnacle 90 Booster Car Seat, Broadway","My reviews and a recommendation by an engineer who testifies about failed car seats led us to this model.  Thankfully, we have not had to test it, but it is comfortable, sturdy and easy to adjust.  Our 5-year-old granddaughter is now able to buckle and unbuckle herself.  She is high enough to see what is going on.  We feel confident she is protected.",5
Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib,"Yes, the bibs are easy to clean and are a great size. As costly as they were, I didn't get much use out of them though because my 6 mth old was so distracted by the patterns on them, that feeding was becoming more like play time.  I know it sounds ridiculous, but the patterns are just too flamboyant for the purpose it serves - to pick up spillage, not to entertain my little one. I'm happy that my baby finds the colours engaging, but imagine me with a spoon trying to compete with his bib for attention (yes, imagine!). It was simply too much.",3
"JJ Cole Agility Stretch Carrier, Black, Small","I love my agility carrier. It is light weight, easy to use and fits perfectly in my diaper bag so I can take it with me when I am out and about.",5
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra",Easy to install. Great seat for tall kids. Peace of mind that my little one is as safe as possible in the car.,5
Eddie Bauer 2 Pack Cling SunShade,"The product came folded a bit sloppy, which created extra wrinkles, but if you're patient, you can work them out. We bought a set 2 years ago for our first child, and they are holding up great on one side of the car. Just bought a second set and installed on the other side of the car without any issues.Here's what you do...1. Clean the window to remove any dust and lint.2. Remove the cling from package and avoid too many finger prints on it. Also, try not to place it on your car seats or anywhere that it can pick up dust/lint.3. Spray a light mist of glass cleaner on your window.4. ""Float"" the cling on the wet surface until you get it where you want it.5. Using an old credit card, work any bubbles/liquid out from the center of the cling towards the edges. Be careful to do this gently and slowly so that the card doesn't catch on the plastic and make a kink.6. Use paper towels to soak up glass cleaner as it seeps out from the edges.7. If you have any stubborn areas, life the cling away from the glass, spray more cleaner, and repeat steps 5-6.There may be some bubbles that linger, but they tend to disappear after a few days of exposure to warm sun.Hope this helps!",4
Stork Craft Rochester Stages Crib with Drawer,"It was delivered very quickly, and very well packed a slight difference on the color since it looks a bit darker online but i still like it!! great place to buy plus it was free shipping and I really shopped around best place overall BUT after I assembled it the drop side its horrible and easy to brake the thing that secures it its very simple and impossible to fix in addition the bottom drawer somehow falls from the metal slider so I don't know what to do since I have put it together 3 times, but oh well too late now to be able to return it its been a year since I bought it I am military so I had to move",5
"Badger Basket Three Bin Storage Cubby, Blue","We needed storage cubbies for our playroom.  This is the perfect size!  Holds a lot!  It also is at a great level for them to play on top of it.  WE thought about getting another and stacking them, but we don't want to take away from my daughter being able to play on top of it.  It was easy to put together and it looks great too! Love this item!",5

"Safety 1st OnSide Air Protect Convertible Car Seat, Adeline Black",The straps are too short! I tired to put this carseat in my F150 rearfacing and the straps won't reach! I also tried using the seatbelt but no matter how tight you get it (and lock it) the carseat is NOT succure! Its not safe at all! I am just plain angry with this desgin flaw. They could have made the straps just 3 inches longer. Even on the longest setting it still won't reach. Also the cup holder is a joke! JUNK!,1
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll",AWESOME - super portable and easy to attach just about anywhere. My 4 month old is transfixed by it and his 2 year old brother loves to &#34;show him&#34; everything it can do. We use it at meal time so that the whole family is able to sit togehter at the table (4 month onl has this attached to the high chair to stay entertained while everyone else eats),5
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Team Wall Decor, Snoopy",they are light and easy to hang.  the colors are bright and they look great on the wall in the baby's nursery.,5
BROWN 24 Inch Length Extension for Metal Hearth Pad,"With a Christmas visit from a new toddler grandson coming up, I wanted a way to protect him from falls into our large raised stone hearth.  The measurements for this product were too small for the length of our hearth, so I ordered the extension kit.  The pad worked fine as far as being protective, but I was unable to figure out how to put it together with the extension.  I am fairly mechanically-minded for a girl, but this was beyond me.  So I had to call in the troops (my husband), and it even took him a little while to figure out how to make the thing fit together properly so that it would cling to the hearth properly.  Actually, he ended up going down in the basement and getting some kind of extra piece of metal to sturdy it up so it would stay together.  However, once it was finally mounted, it stayed on like a charm, and we were very glad it was there, as our toddler fell into it more than once, saving a nasty bump on the head, I am sure. As long as you are ""handy"", I would say you would be happy with this product overall.",4

"Withings Smart Baby Monitor, White","So completely functional that I moved from baby monitoring to in house monitoring while I'm away. The functionality of the product allows viewing from anywhere in the with quick connections via WiFi. I am able to receive motion detection, temperature drops or rises, humidity detection and sound detection alerts on my iPhone and iPad making this an invaluable tool for monitoring my home while I'm away. I'm sure it would be a fabulous baby monitor as well, but I have found other uses... Want to get one other for the upstairs portion of my home.",5

Wubbanub Infant Plush Toy Pacifier - Monkey,"Our son loves this thing! It really has helped him grab on and hold things better and quicker. He is able to actually play with it and get it back in his mouth at 3 months old. Esp like the monkey. It is super soft and washes nicely. We have the elephant too, but do not prefer the material on it.",5
"Evenflo SmartSteps Jump and Go, ABC123","We bought this seat a few months ago.  We tried it on every door opening in both our old and new houses, and it doesn't fit on  any of them.  If you have an older house with crown moldings, forget it.  This won't fit and the manufacturer has no solution.",1
"GEENNY Boutique Crib Bedding Set, Horse Western Cowboy, 13 Piece","I had searched for a western/cowboy theme cribset for a while. My husband is a born and raised texan and wanted one. I settled on this one because it had the brown, blue, red, and cow print that I associate with western themes. When it arrived it was more adorable than I thought it was going to be!! It was so perfect. I stuffed the little hanging toy bag full of barn yard animals and it looks great above his crib. The best part is the price!! So many bedsets that I looked at were well over $200. This one was so much cheaper and great quality!! I would definately recommend this nursery set to anyone!!",5
"Lorex BB1811 Wireless Baby Monitor with Color Screen and Talk-to-Baby Intercom, White","I have three video baby monitors. The other two (Motorola, Belkin) are designed to be viewed via an app. The other monitors suffer from fatal problems, for example, if the camera loses power, it forgets its wifi connection, and the app doesn't keep the password and logs out all the time. Also, I don't like the idea of my video being hackable via the internet. The only advantage of the online monitors is that you can see the video when you are not home, i.e., nanny-cam.This Lorex BB1811 Wireless Baby Monitor is a simpler, non-internet technology. It just works. Also, it has a 2-way talk, which is useful, though poor audio quality. Also, the range is not huge -- don't expect the same range as some cordless phones or your wifi.",4
lillebaby COMPLETE Original (Purple/Pink),"This carrier is very comfortable with the adjustable waist strap.  It takes off all the weight from your shoulders, which my other cheap baby carrier does not.  It was fine when my baby only weighed 7 lbs but now my baby is 11 mos and and 20 lbs.  This carrier is so versatile, whether you carry your baby in the front or on your back, it's comfortable in all positions!",5
"Graco Glider Elite Gliding Swing, Brompton","This combo bouncer / swing has worked out very well for us so far. The only thing that I would change about it would be better volume control on the music / noise generator - as it only has LOUD and LOUDER. Otherwise I'm very satisfied that I get to save space in the living room by combining the swing and the bouncer. As others have noted, the material (in particular the support tubes) are NOT the strongest material in the world; however I can't imagine subjecting it to so much force that it would break.Note that the electric swinging mechanism (and the music / noise maker) is powered by a regular wall outlet on the base of the swing, whereas the vibration in the bouncer seat is powered by one D-sized battery.",4
Ameda Custom Breast Flanges with Insert,"The flanges that came with my pump were too small so i ordered these which were the next size up and they were a little too big but ok. Even with the handsfree bra, i still had to hold them close because of the extra space. so, it didnt fit me like i needed it to, but may be perfect for the next woman of course. Sturdy and easy to clean.",3

Mother's Milkmate Breast Milk Storage Rack (10 Bottles),"The price does seem high for this and I wish it came with a few more bottles.  However, I am very glad we invested in it.  Now that I am working and the hubby is taking care of the baby part time it really helps keep the milk in order.  And anything that helps us not waste the ""white gold"" (as I like to think of) it is worth it.  By the way, it does fit the Ameda Purely Yours pump and the Ameda bottles fit it nicely.(I bought this because I read it is better to store milk in bottles than bags - something about the nutrients sticking to the sides of the bags and being lost.)",4
Multi Layers Plastic Beads Fashion Bracelet Punk Style Elegant Jewelry 4 Colors (Blue 1),"Not so good. Not what i expected, its made out of plastic. I regret buying it. Wouldn't recommend it period.",3
"Sunshine Kids Cool Shade For Car Window, Black","We got these for our car window to keep the sun off our baby.  Application was super easy.  She is now 2 and 1/2,and I need to purchase another set.  The first set held up well, I think, but just recently fell off.  For five dollars, we got over two years of shade for our girl.  I'm looking forward to getting these.",5
Evenflo X Sport Plus Convenience Stroller - Grey,"We bought this stroller as a lighterweight option for the airport.  It was nice and light but sturdier than most umbrella strollers. A big plus was the storage compartment under the seat and the overhead shade - absent in most umbrella strollers.  This one is strong enough to support a bag across the handles when child is in seat.  As tall parents (5'10 and 6'0) we particularly appreciated the telescoping handles that allowed us to push the stoller without constantly stooping.  I did not give it 5 stars because the locking mechanism was not as sturdy as we would have liked.  It bent a little when I used a little too much force with my foot to lock it, but it also bent back into shape easily and considering this is our lightweight option stroller I did not expect the same durability/strength as our Phil and Ted stroller.  Overall would highly recommend this stroller for its weight, under seat compartment, overhead shade (although not large provides some cover), telescoping handles and ease of use during travel.  We will use it again particularly on metro trips as it folds quickly, has storage and some cover, and maneuvers well.",4
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","It was recommended by my friend. It fits me so well, and easy to use. I use the Medela Pump In Style and it works great.",5
Kick Mats - Deluxe Car Seat Back Protectors 2 Pack - Keep Your Car Seats 100% Clean From All The Stains And Scuffmarks Left By The Kids With These Auto-Protective Seat Covers - Designed For Most Vehicles - Protect Your Investment - Lifetime Guarantee,"My 3 yr old son is pretty good...but kicking the seat back is just one thing he won't stop doing.  These protectors are cost effective and do what they're supposed to.  Four (4) stars only because they could be a tad wider and the elastic strap at the bottom could be a bit longer.  I have a Hyundai Genesis and my wife drives a Subaru Tribeca, neither have extremely oversized seats and I'd say if the protectors were 2&#34; wider they'd be perfect.  The elastic strap at the bottom took some tugging to get around the seat, and they are stretched just about to the limit.  Hopefully it doesn't break the stitching over time.",4
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"I bought this bouncer after my daughter was born.  I had the kick and play bouncer for my son and loved it!  I was looking to get something a bit more stimulating though and I saw the great reviews for this one so I bought it.First of all this bouncer has toys that hang way too low off of it.  The toys rested on my daughters legs and when she'd kick or move around in there the seams on the toys would scratch up her legs.  Also the seat sits up way to far and so when my baby was a newborn she wasn't cradled in it and looked really uncomfortable.  There are also no side supports so even though my baby is now 5 months old she's almost able to manuver her body over to the sides, so I have to supervise her at all times while she's in it to make sure she won't come out of the seat.  Not so great if you want to do a few things around the house!  The 3 point strap is also really crappy, and not very secure, so all in all I'd say for the price (which in my opinion is WAY TOO MUCH!) you can get a much better bouncer/rocker than this one!!",1
"Naturepedic Waterproof Fitted Crib Pad, 28x52","The quality is good, but it does NOT shrink to fit.  We have the classic 150 2 stage crib mattress.  It does shrink somewhat.  The first time I washed and dried it like the instructions say.  The second time I increased the drying heat to medium and it is still too big.  I may try again with high heat.  Even though it is too big, once I put the sheet on over it, it took care of the bagginess problem.  The new problem, however, is that it looks like the sheet is about to rip apart at the seams (a standard 28 x 52 sheet).  If I could only find a 29x53 sheet, the problem would be solved.As far as the product taking to long to dry, etc, ... just put it in the dryer.",3
Bassettbaby First Choice Sugar Plum 3 in 1 Convertible Crib,"I bought this crib before my son was born back in April. Now that he is 6 months and able to turn over onto his stomach in the crib, I noticed that he got his legs stuck between the bars of the crib. It was an awful experience trying to get his legs unstuck because they were stuck up by his thigh. I have e-mailed the manufacturer and I am waiting to hear back. I liked the crib a lot until this incident with my sons legs getting stuck between the bars.",3

Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"I am glad we purchased the Graco Snugrider.  We keep it in the car and use for quick trips shopping or running errands. The basket is a generous size.  It doesn't ride as smoothly as we would like, but for the price you can't beat it.  I do not reccomend it as your only stroller, as I do not think it would do well on bumpy sidewalks, or any less than smooth surface.",4

Medela Swing Breastpump,"This is an easy to use and effective pump. I am glad to have bought it, but it has one huge flaw and that is that the storage bottle and the pump attachment leak! Not just a little either - its a big leak.

OsoCozy Better Fit Unbleached Prefolds (Infant 4x8x4 Fits 6-16 lbs.) - Dozen,I love the quality of the diaper but the size of them aren't the greatest. They become awfully short after a few washes.

Playtex Diaper Genie Essentials Diaper Disposal Pail,"I bought this to replace the original Diaper Genie because it was rated so highly for odor containment... BAH HUMBUG!  It smells every time you add a new diaper.  Just ONE poopy diaper ruins the room.  I could've sworn it said you didn't have to push down with the diaper, but you have to push it down through a trap door.  Once that trap opens, out come the smells!  I'm using our old one and donating this one!",1

"Munchkin Arm &amp; HammerDiaper Bag Dispenser and Bags, 2-Count","although marketed for diaper disposal, I purchased these bags for an ostomy patient to have on hand for disposal of used appliances.These bags open wide making getting the waste in the bag easier. The ostomy supplies come with a disposal bag but it is a long tube like a newspaper bag and it was always a struggle to get items in the bag.The scent is not overwhelming but just enough to mask the odor and the dispenser keeps them neatly contained.",5
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","Such a good idea! Most teething toys are for the front area of the mouth... our little one wants something he can put in his mouth.

DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"I read every review and thought I would give it a try. The sounds are fine but the volume does not go up very high at all. We don't have any other kids, so our home is quiet for the most part. I think the baby will be able to hear it, if its close to him but I don't expect it to drown out any other noises in the house. It's too bad because I think some of the sounds are pretty good, some however are kind of weird just white noise. Its okay for the money. I am probably just going to deal with it rather than return it.UPDATE---- 4-21-2010Well I have been using this sound machine for almost 2 years. I was skeptical at first, obviously by my first post. But now I have to say I love it. I have basically had it turned on 24/7 for 2 years and it's still working and working great. Yea its not super loud but it works. My son wakes up to really loud noises but sleeps through everything else. In fact we just had our second child and I just bought another one for her room too! I think for the price its a good buy.",4
"Boon Naked Collapsible Baby Bathtub, Blue/White","I highly recommend this tub. We've only been using it for about a week and a half but it's been great. My son is almost five months old. I was using a bath sponge, which I love; however, it only lasted a few weeks. It began tearing apart and I'm not about to purchase a new one every few weeks. We tried the large plastic tub. That was bulky, hard to store and hard to clean. I tried the smaller collapsible plastic tub with the inflatable inside. This was too small and once again hard to clean and dry. I was a bit nervous to purchase this due to the price and not being able to see it first.But it's been great. We have a VERY tiny house and its been perfect since it goes flat and can fit in between our tub and shelf very easily. I love that it comes with a hook attached so that it can hang and dry. Usually from the time I bathe my son to when I go to bed is the time it takes to drip dry.Some people have had the unfortunate occurrence of the bottom dropping out on the baby. This did happen to me, but I didn't have the tub steady or the piece locked in. So user error.My son does manage to slip around pretty good when there is a lot of water in the tub, but as I am right there with him, it's fine. I think he enjoys the feeling of all the water anyway. I've used the stopped so that he keeps water in with him. Or I leave the faucet on and remove the stopper so there is equal filling and draining. Both options work.",5

JJ Cole System Bag - Cocoa/Pink,"My baby isn't due for another two months, but I ordered this diaper bag early after seeing the other options out there...BORING. The price is fair, and the bag is amazing. I love the design and colors, and the great gel-filled adjustable shoulder ""pad"" is going to be great when the bag is not attached to a stroller.All the cool, hip moms should be lucky enough to find this item. Other bags that are this cool are between $150 and $200. Who can pay that much with a baby coming?Shipping was super fast as well. I think I got mine about 4 days after ordering, and I chose regular shipping.",5
"Kushies Deluxe Flannel Change Pad, Yellow with Brown Dots","We don't have a changing table and change him on the carpeted floor or on the bed. It's a good size and suits our needs.Pros - portable can diaper anywhere in the apt/house (also have one in our diaper bag), larger size, absorbs liquids instead of liquids rolling off it. Hate how the perforations from stitching on plastic pads can allow liquids to seep in (how do you clean that?).Cons - I feel like the flannel causes lint in the laundry. It absorbs liquids so you have to launder instead of wiping off.  flannel shrinks a little so its smaller than waterproof backing (but when you have a newborn those things don't matter anymore).  Amazon doesn't carry all the cool colors and patterns that are available.",4
Munchkin 6 Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoon,These spoons have a very soft tip. The soft tip is good for the baby's gums. The handle are longer and thicker then most of the infant spoons. These spoon are pretty flexible. The food actually stays on pretty well. You would not make a big mess while trying to get the baby food out of the container. The colors of the spoons are bright and attractive. I would definitely recommend this product.,5

Munchkin All-Star Potty Seat - Football,"I bought this item for my son which is 2 years old, he is a big boy 36lbs, everytime he uses the potty pee comes out from the potty (from the bottom ) it's disgusting.

"Lifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Sky/Spring Green","some of the best teethers out there! LOVE itPros:1. Baby can hold it very easily (my 4 month old held it without no problem)2. Has different textures in different areas, which is more fun for them to chew on giving more tactile stimulation3. Still nice and chewy (not rock hard & heavy) and COOL when taken out of the freezer. So your baby doesn't get a shock out of it!4. There's 2! So, I keep one in the diaper bag for travel, and one at home.Cons:1. Pricey!BUT.... worth it!",5

"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","I don't have a lot of space in my living room, but I do have a lot of STUFF, and rather than moving all our STUFF away for a couple of years, I figured it would be easier to contain my baby.It's a far cry from fancy, but it serves its purpose. Lots of people commented on how they returned it the next day because it was so hard to maneuver the panels. When we first opened it, it was VERY difficult to open the gates and change the shape of it. However, with time, it's loosened up and now we can open and collapse it with ease. The ""gate"" function just takes some practice, too.This is meant to be a play yard, NOT a gate. It's very unstable when it's not connected to itself, and it's super easy for Baby to push over or move. When it's connected, though, it keeps my 11 month old in one spot. He doesn't try to drag it around the room as others have mentioned, but we also keep a bin of toys in there and I think it would make the structure too heavy to drag, anyway.As far as climbing out of it...babies are like little Houdinis. They will find a way out everything, eventually. My son has taken to stacking up toys in a corner and seeing if he can reach his leg over the side. He hasn't managed an escape, yet, but then he's never alone for very long, either.I like it. It was exactly what I was looking for and at a decent price, too. I purchased the expansion panels, also, but they are still in their box in our laundry room. Right now, it's a good size for us, although I like having the option to expand it, if needed.",4
The Shrunks Indoor Toddler Inflatable Travel Bed,I got this for my son when he was too big for a pack n play and he loved it.  As soon as my daughter was ready (18mths) we got her one too.  they are so portable and easy and the kids love them for travel.  I'm sure we'll get years of use,5
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","Though it was not recommended not to place a bumper in the crib, I liked that this one was 'breathable'.  Now that my son is older, he squirms a lot in his crib, so this bumper keeps him from hurting himself while he sleeps (i.e, an arm/leg squeezing through slats).",4
Prince Lionheart Balance Bike,"My son was tall for his age, so I knew there would be no issue concerning it being too tall for him like some of the reviews I had read. I love the rubber wheels which glide nicely. The only things that I wished were different were that the seat be a little bigger or more cushioned... it doesn't have much cushioning and seems like it would eventually be uncomfortable if he rode for a long ride. Also, the wood slightly chipped in the front when my son fell with the bike once.. not real noticeable but could happen again... but another thing which I didn't consider when purchasing a wood bike was that I would have to keep it indoors most of the time instead of outside. Other than that, my son loves the bike and I am happy with the purchase... and since we keep it stored inside, he rides it around on our wood floors sometimes as well.",4
Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,"I originally bought this to replace the aweful mattress that was included in my Chicco Lullaby LX pack & play as the mattress included was so thin.This mattress is wonderful! And, it is made in the USA!The funny part is we did use this in the pack & play, but we used it even more in the playroom.  This is nice to just have out in a playroom for them to lay down on/relax/read/etc.  It has been used even more in this way.  Just thought I'd point this out since I hadn't thought about it before it accidentally happened.  One day we took it out while putting the pack & play away & they layed on it & loved it. We decided why not have a soft mattress in the playroom.  It has been there ever since.I do want to include that it didn't fit our pack & play perfectly.  There was a little gap, but what we used it for this wasn't an issue.  However, if you plan on them sleeping in here this might be a safety issue especially depending on the age.Pack & plays should come w/ this level of mattress. I wish someone would have told me sooner to buy this - it is worth every penny.",5
"Sunshine Kids Radian XTSL Convertible Car Seat, Bentley","My daughter is 16 months old.  She is already 32 pounds and 34 inches tall.  I really want to keep her rear-facing as long as possible, so I was in the market to buy a new car seat when I came across this one.  I am very impressed with it so far.  She previously rode in a Evenflo Triumph Advance, which was extremely wide and took up most of the back seat, even when it was placed in the middle.  This seat is very narrow and provides her with much more leg room when rear-facing.  It has a nice low profile, which makes it much easier for me to get her in and out of the back middle seat in my civic.  She seems very comfortable in it.  I haven't been able to use the ""superlatch"" feature because my car was manufactured prior to September 2005, so I installed the seat with the seatbelt and it honestly couldn't have been easier.  It is in VERY securely too.  I am confident that this seat is as safe as any seat could possibly be in my car.  I know that people have reviewed other Radians in the past and seen it as a ""negative"" that the seat is so heavy, but I don't have a problem with it...of course it is heavy, it's a steel frame!  Besides, the fact that it weighs 23 pounds is not hidden in the description of the product, so no one should be taken by surprise.  It is a very big seat.  My only ""con"" really, is that I had to move my front seats up to fit it in the back of the civic.  I can still fit in the driver's seat with no problem, but I'm closer to the steering wheel than I'd like to be.  The trade-off, though, is that my daughter has so much more leg room in the back, so it is worth it to me.  I'm glad I made the purchase.",5
GroVia Certified Organic Cotton Soaker Pad 2 Pack,"I did NOT like this product. I TRIED to, don't get me wrong. Its NOT for everybody. I bought these, and prepped them, and EVERY SINGLE TIME my baby wore them he LEAKED through it! It says 8 pounds on, but I read somewhere you should wait til they are around 12. At 13 pounds (and chunky) my baby wore this for the first time. Even at 15 pounds he leaked through the legs. He's no skinny baby, he was 15 pounds at his 2 month checkup. He's not even a heavy wetter. He can wear a pocket all night long with no problems but as soon as he pees in this he leaks right out of it. Plus the insert is fit weird because its thinner in the front than it is in the back. Doesn't even make sense if you have a boy.",1
"Systane Lid Wipes, Eyelid Cleansing Wipes, 30 ea",I actually like these better than the Ocusoft brand. They really do produce a good lather. One wipe allows me to remove my eye makeup (which is not heavy) and completely clean my eyelids. The Ocusoft ones never did lather up at all. These are also much cheaper. Win-win!,5
Postpartum Support Girdle Belt w/zipper Support Belly Band Medical-Grade Compression Bellefit,"I don't have words to explain how amazing is the Bellefit Zipper Girdle...I used my girdle since day 3 of postpartum, I gain around 33 pounds in my whole pregnancy and my baby has 6 weeks old and I already lose 23 pounds just using my girdle all day. I definitely recommend this product to any mom that want to reshape her body as fast as possible....",5
"Goodbyn Bynto Food Container, Red","This must be great if you have only dry foods, but since the lid doesn't seal tightly, it's pretty useless if you have anything that could ooze out. I never use it.",1
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,"These sheets fit my Crescent minicrib mattress fine, but they are not durable.  After just 2 washes, they developed a small hole in them and appear worn. Perhaps they would have held up better on a gentle wash cycle, but my baby spit up lot and I needed to clean the sheets well.",3
"Bumbo Floor Seat, Aqua","I purchased this for my baby when she turned 3 months old. I didn't have her spend a ton of time in it, but I wanted her to get familiar with sitting up unassisted. The first time she sat in it she gave me the biggest grin!Fast forward 6 weeks and we've purchased the tray so we can start introducing foods. I am wondering though how long she'll be able to sit in this as her chubby thighs already get stuck on the way out...Just make sure you use this as directed!",5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I am the type of person who really does her research and after researching diaper disposal systems, this is the one that won out!  It is stylish and nice looking and all that, and we never smelled anything out of it until now.....we have used it since he came home from the hospital and I was really impressed with the way we never smelled anything, except when we were disposing of a diaper.  It is the strangest thing that now that he is 8 months old, it is the stinkiest thing, I feel bad for him leaving it in the room with him while he sleeps.  I spray it down with disinfectant spray and wipe it with disinfectant wipes all the time and it still smells.It is very expensive as are the refills, I shall continue researching disposal systems for our next baby.I just hope this helps someone else who is doing research.  I don't think there is a diaper disposal system that doesn't smell.",1
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black",I really like these because they are really easy to install. All you do is open it and press it against the window and it sticks. I really considered giving 4 stars because I don't like the way it looks from the outside. You can see airpockets and bubbles behind the plastic so it really isn't that aesthetically pleasing from the outside. But I decided to do 5 stars because for me the function surpasses the look from the outside. It looks good from the inside and I am not sure what I was expecting to see from the outside since it literally is a piece of plastic stuck to a window.,5
"Arm's Reach Arc Mini Co-sleeper, Toffee Stripe",This product works great and easy to set up. Sets up with the bed and very stable. I would recommend this product to everyone with a new baby.,5
Summer Infant 77510 Snuzzler - Ivory Cotton Terry,This snuzzler works well to add extra support for a small baby in a car seat or stroller. It really helped my sons head stay in place when he was too little to hold it up. It has a terry cloth side and a smooth side which is great for keeping cool in summer or warmer in winter.,5
Contours Classique 3-in-1 Wood Bassinet,"Bought this as a gift for my new grandson.  My daughter assembled it by herself and loves it.  She says its sturdy, looks great and is the perfect height.",5
Cosco Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat,"At 4 months old my son was to big for his &lt;22lb infant seat.  On a budget and wanting a seat that will grow with him, we pick this one.  We have a Chevy Blazer and it is a snug fit, but my son is very comfortable it.  Guaranteed to put him to sleep.  We just had to put a towel under the back side of it to make it recline better.  It is very easy to get him in and out.  Best of all it goes up to 100lbs.  With the next baby we will go staight to this car seat.",4
"Leveret Bib (X-SMALL (6-18 Months), Flowers)","This bib is great, material does not allow liquids to soak through, easy to wipe clean, fits perfect and my daughter actually smiles when I put it on her.  There are also pockets to catch anything that falls.  Would highly recommend and will continue buying larger sizes as she grows!!",5
Thermal-Aid Blue Bear: Buckley,the only way to improve this would be to put corn in the arms and legs too. but other then that it is great for small surfaces. Go with a non animal for large surfaces. All thermal aid products are awesome though.,5
Satin Laced Bib,"Arrived on time, packaged well. I used this bib for my daughters christening and it matched the dress perfectly. Only thing I suggest is velcro or a snap closure instead of tie.",5
"Munchkin Click Lock 2 Count Sippy Cup, 9 ounce","I myself tried to drink from it and almost couldn't. It's like they made this product and never actually had a person try to put his or her mouth on the spout. It's the wrong shape and feels horrible. And, if you do get some water out of it, a little stays inside the top part of the spout and can get all over everything. Terrible product.",1
"TL Care Organic Cotton Nursing Pads, Natural, 6 Count","Very soft. Wash well. Held up great. I would recommend to anyone. I didn't leak much, but these are very soft and work wonders to protect sore and cracked nipples. LOVED these!!!!",5
"Adiri BPA Free Natural Nurser Ultimate Bottle Stage 3 Orange, Fast Flow (6+ months) - 2 Pack","We used all three stages of this bottle for our daughter.  When she was first born we experimented with other brands of bottles and even the slow flow ones fed her too quickly and resulted in spit up.  When we switched to this brand she quit spitting up after feeding.  As some other reviewers have said the bottles can leak, but I have found that if you get the bottle wet (on the tread and twist on cap) before filling it and then screw it on it is not only much easier to screw the cap on, but it doesn't leak at all.  Once I figured this out I have not had problems with these bottles leaking.  So if I have to run the bottle under water before I fill it it is not really and inconveinence for the benefits I got from this bottle.  Hope this advice helps someone else!",5
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black",I like this product because my b-stroller comes with only one cup holder and no upper storage area for iPod/ MP3 paper or personnel items. With this I can!!!!',4
&quot;THE HOME SENTINEL&quot; Digital Wireless 2 Camera Handheld Baby Monitor: GUARANTEED FREE FROM INTERFERENCE!!!,"We recieved our cameras with the intent on using them as baby monitors in each room.  The way it is explained is that the system has a sensitivaty alarm and when sound goes above that threshold the camera switches and you can hear what is going on in the room.  I had it in my daughters room with the sensativaty on high and she was crying and it never picked up.  There are times when she is cryin and it picks up, but then cuts out.  I can hear her down the hall but the the microphone does not pick it up.  I moved the camera extremely close to her bed and got a little better, but if you are not in front or right up close to it the microphone is useless.  The picture quality is excellent though.  Maybe I got a defect, but that is my experience.  I would not recommend for baby monitor or if you need to monitor sound as the microphone barely works.",2
"Nuvo Ritmo Pregnancy Sound System, Black","After reading the reviews I was so excited to buy the Ritmo belt. I received the belt about a week ago and I'm not so sure its as great as the reviews stated.  The product claims to have a safety device to control sound that's delivered to baby but my belt is just loud.  There is no difference between the sound that I hear in my headphones and the sound that comes through the speakers. The volume is controlled directly from the device that is attached to the belt, there is no volume control on the belt itself.  I tried switching from post to pre, the pre is slightly LOUDER, but no significant difference.  I was under the impression that the belt could be used at work/train/etc. but this just sounds like a Stereo attached to my stomach!!!  The first day I received the belt I contacted customer service via email and the rep stated that some ""leakage"" of sound should be expected but this is NOT leakage.  I'm going to call customer service tomorrow and will update my review later.  Hopefully this is just a defective belt.  Surely, all of the belts cant be this loud, otherwise I could have just taped my phone directly to my stomach and received the same quality sound.Oh and the belt is too big.  I'm 17 weeks pregnant, 5'5 & 150lbs but apparently my stomach is still too small because the belt slides in the front even if the back is pulled tight.",2
Arm's Reach Natural Original Co-Sleeper,"I love this product!!  I had borrowed the mini size from my friend, but at 5 months my little girl grew out of it and we still wanted her to sleep with us,  the original is much roomier.  Of course, it also takes up more space in the room.  the mattress is a little hard, but our little girl doesnt mind.  I love being able to see her lying next to me without having to worry that were going to roll over her or something.  great invention arms reach!!",5
"Luvable Friends 4-Pack Flannel Receiving Blankets, Blue","I received a package of these as a gift.  I really wanted to like them.  The colors and patterns are cute and cheerful.  And, those colors and patterns are the only positive thing about these.The fabric is thin.  It's flannel, which normally would mean it has some weight.  Nope, regular cotton like a button down shirt would be made of is almost the same weight and almost as absorbent.  You can kind of use these as burp cloths, but they aren't great for that, and really a standard kitchen towel would be better.Each blanket is small.  These can't be used to swaddle a baby.  They are 28 x 28 inches.  I can't even tuck these under the edge of the bassinet and cover the baby with the untucked part.  Even worse, the edges are surged, not hemmed, and that combined with such light weight fabric, means you would have to iron the blanket after washing in order to get the full size.  The blankets wrinkle horribly at the edges after a wash, so you loose 2 inches on each side.  I have other blankets with surged edges made of heavier fabric which don't wrinkle like this, but for this fabric, it's just absolutely not how the edges should have been finished.I will cut mine into four equal pieces, and just use them as rags to wash bottles, etc with.Please don't buy these for you or for someone else.  They are a waste of time to try to use and a waste of resources to manufacture or buy.  You would do better to buy a package of wash cloths or handtowels to clean with, or just go to a fabric store buy some fabric and cut it into larger squares using pinking shears so the edges don't unravel.Update:  After about four washings each, the serging on the sides has pulled out, and I had to cut it off.  So, I have an unfinished edge.  The soft fluffy part of the flannel has also washed out of the fabric, leaving something that is a mix between flannel and cheese cloth.  I suspect that as I continue to use these for changing table covers, they will turn completely into cheese cloth after about 8 washings each.",1
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"One of my baby's favorite toys. The hook is perfect to connect to the floor gym, swing, stroller, car seat, or just to hold on to. Great sensory toy!",5
Children's Nursery Room Wall Decal - Baby Circus,The quality of the prouct is very good and is very beautiful as well. Perfect wall sticker for nursery decoration.,5
"Babe Ease Original Clean Diner, Blue Zoo","I see a lot of negative reviews about this highchair cover so I thought I would put in my two cents. I bought this because I wanted to keep my child safe from the millions of germs on the highchairs in restaurants. I have had great success at over 10 different restaurants with this cover. It always fits, the velcro is easy to adjust and it isn't bulky. It also folds up easy and is great for transportation. Maybe I am doing something differently, but it seems strange to me that this would not work for some people and works for others. I think its a great product and certainly worth a try for anyone considering purchasing it. It has worked for me every time!",5
Levana Lila Digital Baby Video Monitor with Night Vision and Talk to Baby Intercom 32000 (White),"This is a great monitor, easy to figure out and good picture.  I love how it has a ""talk back"" feature so you can use  it almost as a walkie talkie with the kids.  I use it with my toddler to make sure she's really taking a nap.  :)  Would definitely recommend!",5
Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy,"I needed something soft to mount on my bikes sidecar.  This stroller organizer fit the bill for far less than most """"specialty"""" auto/motorcycle/RV products marketed to do this simple task.",5
Jeep Deluxe Stroller Weather Shield,"I wish it fit a little more snugly over the stroller so that wind could not get up under it so easily. However, that is my only complaint. We use it in conjunction with the toddler Bundle Me, in winter months, to protect from the cold and wind/ rain and snow.",4
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I actually can get more milk faster with this than with the cheap electric pump I bought.  This one is easy to use and quiet.  If you are pumping more than once a day it could get tiring, but otherwise it's great!",5
"Britax Stroller Organizer, Black","I don't even need to bring my diaper bag when my 15 month old and I go on short errands around town. This organizer holds her sippy cup and snacks, my keys, id/wallet, cell phone, and water! I would suggest purchasing for your Britax stroller!",4
"The First Years  Deluxe Fold and Go Diapering Kit, Black/Gray","This is perfect!  I bought it for a friend and she loves it!  I ordered one for myself.  The diaper bag I had purchased for my friend had a very flimsy changing pad inside, so this one was a huge improvement!",5
"Luvable Friends Infant Pillow Case, Traditional Blue Print","The pillow case (ours is pink) fits great on her toddler pillow, is soft and seems durable.  We've washed it 3 times so far and no pilling or issues.  Cheap price - good product.  :)",5
Mobi Glomate Junior,"I love how this light is safe for my daughter to touch, considering shes such a busy/nosey 2yr old! We recently moved and i was SURE,considering she is usually whiny at bedtime that i would have to spend numerous nights sleeping on the floor of her room to get her used to sleeping alone in a room all her own. But from day one i let her have this Mobi light and shes done wonderfully! What a relief..!",5

Kiddopotamus Bibbity Rinse &amp; Roll Bib in Blue,Our favorite bibs ever!! So durable. Dishwasher safe. We take these with us everywhere! Watermelon did stain one of ours for a month or so but after a few cycles in the dishwasher it looks new again.,5
"Fisher-Price Musical Mobile, Rainforest Peek-a-Boo Leaves","I bought this mobile when my son was 8 weeks old and it was the first thing that made him stay in his crib without crying.  He would lie and just stare at it mesmerized by the slow movements and bright colors.  Coming in every 15 minutes to push a button sure beat standing there, winding up a mobile every couple minutes.He's able to play on his own now that he's 16 weeks, but he still loves watching it.  It has never put him to sleep though, it gets him very excited and he ""dances"" and laughs whenever I turn it on for him.  I use it without the lights and music and he still goes crazy for it.  I would say this is the best purchase I made for my newborn, as he loves it, it looks great in the nursery, and it saved me from having to hold him all the time!Easy to put together and install, long-battery life, and overall excellent material quality.",5
GroVia BioLiners One Size Unscented - 200 Count,"I find that these do an excellent job of keeping poop from smearing into the liner and make cloth diapering much easier. However, I do find it hard to believe that it's safe to flush the liners as I have wash and dried some and they do not break down. This is great from a re-usable perspective, but I cringe to think how long it takes for them to break down in my sewage line and am fearful of a backup/clogged pipe.On the other hand, we should not be throwing poop (aka toxic waste) in the trash.",4
"OXO Tot Seedling Youth Booster Seat, Green",We bought this for our 2.5yr old and absolutely love it. It's so light she can move it around herself. It doesn't slide on our wood chairs & it's the perfect size. It's also modern and cute!,5

"Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer Bags, 6 Pack, White","Was gong to purchase an electric steamer when I came across these reviews andI took a flyer.  Not only is this time saving and effective, but it is super convenient and frees up counter space!  Instead of waiting for the dishwasher, I can have them sterilized in 3 minutes.  I found that in the dishwasher, random particles of food would occasionally settle in the nipples and they would sometimes have a cloudy appearance.  If you are using the dishwasher I recommend the munchkin dishwasher baskets.  But I find these much more convenient and effective as well as a space saver for your counter. Oh...and did I mention cost effective as well? Each bag can be used up to 20 times.",5
Primo 4-In-1 Soft Seat Toilet Trainer and Step Stool White with Pastel Blue Seat,"We're on our 6th potty seat, in search of the perfect potty chair (after 2 kids), and this is almost perfect. I love that the 'boy' part in front is molded in to the seat, unlike another we had with a detatchable spray stopper that was used mostly as a toy, and eventually was lost.It also seems fairly comfy. I thought it would be a bit more cushiony than it is, but it's not bad. It's mainly just a thick rubbery type plastic for the cover, which detaches from the bottom white piece. ...and there in lies the problem. It regularly comes detatched from the white part with the handles, and pee gets in the grooves, and it becomes a pain to clean. It's also kind of frustrating to put back on, so usually I just lay it on there to save time.Other positives: It's stable, doesn't move much when he's on it. It's great as a step stool, and it's definitely large enough for my tall toddler.All in all, not bad, but I wish I could find a potty seat with fewer parts to mess with, since it gets used several times a day.",4
Postpartum Support Girdle Belt w/zipper Support Belly Band Medical-Grade Compression Bellefit,"My baby is one month old and I already feel great! The day he was born I felt like my stomach was falling off me, it was horrible, I didn't think I'd fit into the medium size Bellefit (dual closure) that I bought so I wrapped myself in ace bandage. okay, that didnt help at all. so the next day I decided to try the Bellefit on. it was a tight fit! had to get help closing it up! lol but oh man did I feel better. I took my son to his drs. Apt and everyone commented about how great I already looked. :) also I think the bellefit really helped in getting my abs to go back together for diastsis recti. Great product definitely worth the price. if you spent a lot of money on baby gear for your little one. spend the money on this for yourself. You're worth it and you won't be dissapoited!!",5
Fisher-Price Potty On-the-Go,"This is a perfect addition to the crazy amount of stuff I already have to carry for my girls! It is the perfect travel potty and we have used it in many situations -- shopping, airports, front seat of my Honda Accord, friends houses, etc.  It is very sturdy, unassuming, easy to use and just the perfect addition to this new world of toddlerville we just moved to.  My child is 2.5, average height and weight, and it is perfect for her ... with room to grow.  I bought my own small scented trash bags to use with it and I pre-loaded the inside with papertowels/TP to minimize any splashing -- we have had no such issue with splashing even without the pre-loading. Love the built-in splash guard, even for a girl, because sometimes they really have to go!  Saves you from a pee pee explosion -- it happens.  Get this travel potty -- worth the money and worth the convenience.  I love, love this potty!! (did I just say that?)",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","I needed a way to separate my frisky little puppy from my older cat. This gate works really well - I like the easy one-handed walk-through feature.

Child Airplane Travel Harness - Cares Safety Restraint System - The Only FAA Approved Child Flying Safety Device,"Got this because I was tired of lugging our car seat onto the airplane.  The little one is big enough that she can use this too.  Additionally, it helps us to avoid the embarrassment of our toddler kicking the seat in front of her when she's in the car seat.  I suppose I could book the seat in front just to avoid that, but I'd rather not be separated that way from the family.Pros:Reasonably pricedConvenience of not bringing car seat onto the plane (BEST Pro of all)Easy, two-minute installationMakes your kid feel like &#34;one of the adults&#34; by letting him/her sit on the actual airplane seatCons:NoneJust be sure to line up the strap on the seat back to just above your child's shoulder.

"Gerber Graduate BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips Spill Proof Cup, 7 Ounce, Colors May Vary","They don't leak and are durable.  I do wish they were a couple of ounces bigger, but that's okay.  I have four of these all-together at home and they're great when having little kids over since they're all the same size and shape and no one gets to argue about have regular cups (without lids).Having said that about the size, they are perfect for my two year old's little hands.",4
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"So far so good.  I was using the cheapie pail...and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart.  I am wondering how some of these reviewers are able to stand having kids?  Even the old pail hardly smelled bad to me, I think after you have changed diapers for 4 years, you get somewhat immune to it.  I could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point, but this prduct seems to work very well so far.",5
Bella B Bee Gone Cradle Cap Foaming Shampoo - 8 oz Bottle with Pump,The only reason this got 4 stars is it is not a tear free product.  It works sooooo well and smells heavenly!,4
"Dutailier Ultramotion Harvest Sleigh Multiposition Glider Rocker, Sage","We spent a lot of time going back and forth on gliders for our nursery. After sitting in many different models in the stores and deciding on a Dutailier, we chose to buy on Amazon because of the price - and the fact that it was in stock vs. having to wait weeks for a custom order in the store.This glider is amazing. It's so comfortable, the colors are perfect (and identical to what was displayed online), and it was an absolute breeze to put together. I have no doubt that we'll be spending many hours, and nights, in this chair with our newborn.One note to clarify what another reviewer said: This glider does NOT recline. You do have the option to freeze the glider in place in one of the rocking positions, but this is not the same as the reclining option. At the time we purchased the glider, there really wasn't much information on the Amazon website to help you make a good buying decision, but we're really happy with what we selected!",5
BRICA Corner Bath Basket Toy Organizer,This caddy works well in our tiled bath tub but after a couple months the plastic cloth began to collect mildew and the only solution is repeated treatments with bleach. We're not crazy about having bleach around the house. Our next caddy will be made of hard plastic so it can be scrubbed clean without harmful chemicals.,2
Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,"While this product seems like a wonderful idea, in theory it is, but wait until it's no longer under warranty and then it becomes a piece of junk.I know, I've owned four!It works great at first, but after time, it won't charge or light up. The company is not helpful when calling if it's past the warranty stage.... not even after I complained that it happened with ALL FOUR OF MY MOBI lights!I felt that Mobi was unfriendly and unhelpful and they DO NOT stand behind their product.I've also purchased the Mobi lights that are battery operated... once the batteries wear out and I replace them, it won't light up.... again, it's after the warranty is expired.Save your money and go with a company that stands behind their product.... if they truly believed in their lights, they would replace them!!",1
"Elegant Baby Fancy Blanket, White, 30&quot; X 40&quot;","love it very much!! such nice quality, very soft and i love the white color. looks very elegant  thank you",5
"DaVinci Parker 4-Drawer Dresser, Cherry",If you are on a budget and don't want to give up your unborn child for furniture this is a good product for the money looks great and is sturdy. Outside wood solid drawers are solid. Some parts are a little Thin but we are just using it for baby cloths so we don't need a 500 lbs dresser easy assembly,5
Medela Diaphragm Cap Faceplate Pump In Style Advanced 9V DC #6007132,I broke the original one on my pump.  This arrived so fast so I didn't get too messed up with my pumping schedule.  Fit on perfectly to my pump.,5
"Kaboost Portable Chair Booster, Green","My toddler loves to sit with us at the table now, it's less space consumer than a regular eating chair besides that goes with the decoration.I love it",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"We own several of the play and grow toys, my baby and I are just in LOVE with them all but Jacques is the most educational of them all! He is perfect for teaching my baby about touch, sound, cause & effect, has a mirror for her to check her cute little face out, little tags to lick on and the back is the BEST ever!!! It has awesome bold contrasting black and white patterns that is the only thing that seems to grab my newborns attention & calms her during the dreaded tummy time!",5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"this is truly the best swing ever, we bought it when my son was a few days old because he cried constantly.  He absolutely loves looking at the fish and watching the lights and the music helps put him to sleep.  He loves being able to swing in both directions. Yes it does take a few batteries, but it was well worth a little peace and quiet.  THIS SWING IS A MUST HAVE!",5
"Carter's Child of Mine Shopping Cart and High Chair Cover, Girl/Monkey",This is so cute but it is too thin and does not cover as much of the cart as the other one I have.  I had to buy a thick better one that covered more and had pockets in the back,3
PiddlePad Waterproof Seat Liner,These are great!  I put them in the carseats for the accidents that happen when my kids fall asleep in the carseat as they have not yet learned to wake up when they have to use the potty.  I take an extra second to straighten them before the kids sit down and then they stay in place just fine.  The car seat covers are a pain to get off for washing so these help to prevent frequent washings of the car seat covers.Adding some velcro would make these perfect!,4
WallCandy Arts Multi-Color Airplanes &amp; Clouds,We had received a few decorative items that had a vintage transportation theme and these wall stickers just brought everything together for our toddler's room. It was a great way to decorate a blank wall and my husband had fun putting them up.  This product is very easy to use and the only thing you need is your imagination.  People who came to visit thought we had painted them on using stencils!,5
"Brica Koosh'N Infant Neck and Head Support, Gray/Green",I ordered this for my 9 month old. I read the reviews from others and agree that it may get a little warm around the child's neck in the summer months but it has worked well for us so far. My son doesn't like it too much when he's awake in his car seat but I usually put it around his neck if I know he is tired and about to fall asleep in the car and it has worked really well that way. I have to position it just right so it stays around his neck but it looks like he is a lot more comfortable with it than without it. I would recommend this. It works well for us!,4
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,My son is on a higher concentrated formula (27 kcal) and I was looking for something that would mix & store it.  I had been using big shaker bottles but it would take so long to dissolve that my arms just about fell off!  This formula mixer is awesome.  My only complaint is that the lid could be made better.  It doesn't completely seal causing the formula to spill out the side.  I highly recommend it though!,5
Pink Horse Sshlumpie 16&quot; by Douglas Cuddle Toys,"This is adorable! We have a frog one that we got as a gift for my son (now we have 2 b/c he loved it so much and is so attached to it!) and now that we are expecting again, we new this was a must have. It is super soft and they do great in the washing maching. I can't vouch for this one in the wash, but I can only assume it will do as well as the other.",5
"Fantasy Furniture Roundy Chair with Ottoman, Leopard","I bought this for my almost 2 year old daughter and wasnt sure it was going to be big enough!  She LOVES it... sits in and reads books, cutest!  And her cousins who are 3 and 5 love it and fit in it as well!  The 5 year old is getting a little big but lol :)  so cute!  and it came very quickly!  Thank you!",5
"Nuby 2 Pack Embossed Section Plate, Colors May Vary","Almost perfect - love everything about these plates, however they don't stack. That is the only downside - otherwise they are durable (not only do they stand up to baby throwing them on the floor! also seems to be doing just fine going through the dishwasher on the top rack). I had gotten some other toddler plates on Amazon and the plate shattered when baby threw it on the floor the first time :(  These plates here are much more durable.  Also, I like that these plates are colorful.",4
"Dreambaby Safety Latches, 12 Pack",Thanks I forgot what all a nana needs,5
Medela Quick Clean Breastpump &amp; Accessory Wipes,"I use these wipes at work and they let me discreetly wash my pump parts inside my office.  I was happy w/ the 24-pack and bought these 40-pack when I ran out, but they're not the same!  The 40-pack wipes have an unpleasant fishy smell to them, not sure why that could be.  They are a bit bigger and seem to work just as well, but I won't be buying the 40-packs again, I'm going back to the 24-packs.",1
"Lansinoh mOmma Feeding Bottle, 5 Ounce","Not all nipples are alike on women so why give your baby a bottle that looks nothing like you? I have a tear drop shape so this was the only bottle ny exclusively breastfed baby took, however, now he is refusing all bottles including this one. :( the one thing I didn't like was the markings, the ounces weren't visible.",4
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,"I don't love these. The only good thing about them is they attach to my pump. I recently switched to another brand and can fit as much milk in one bag, when I would need two of the medela bags. I have a little bit of an over supply so I was going through them like crazy. I also had one bag explode on me in the freezer, so be careful how full you make them.",2
UPPAbaby Vista Stroller With a Cup Holder Carlin Green,"The stroller looks great and we can't wait to use it when our baby arrives!  It seems to be of excellent quality (we were a little worried because the box it came in was a bit beat up, but it was well protected in additional boxes.)  This was our big splurge and we know we will get a lot of use out of it!  The stroller is a bit heavier than I thought it would be, so I may have some difficulty putting it in and taking it out of my trunk.",4
Chunk One Size Lady Bug Cloth Diaper,"I love how soft and flexable they are! And it fits to your baby the way it needs to be has your baby grows and no need to worry about """"oh my baby has fat legs"""" or """"oh my baby won't grow into it"""" or """"my baby is way to big"""" it can form to your baby! And with summer around the corner it is stylish for the no shirt days ;)",5
"Infant 2.4ghz Digital Video/Audio Baby Monitor System with 2.4&quot; LCD Display Optics, 8 IR LEDs for upto 15ft Night Vision, FHSS Radio Transmission, Rechargeable Lithium Ion Battery for Monitor, Voice Activated Power Saving Mode (BLUE)",My wife and I bought this monitor in November and now in April the sound does not work at all.  FRUSTRATING!!  Now working through a ridiculous amount hold time to get the item replaced after going from number to number that is provided from the manufaturers.  Would never buy again!,1
SheetWorld - Baby Pillow Case - Percale Pillow Cases - Pastel Polka Dot Collection - Green - Made In USA,"Very nice looking.  Nice weave and comfortable.  I sleep on it myself Launders well.  I am 72, C pap user and have COPD.  The pillow helps to lift my head  when needed to sleep or rest, due to digestive problems also.",5
Tadpoles Dino Playmat Set,I bought this for my 5mo grandson. He is just starting to scoot and with wood floors we needed something cushy for him to move around on. I will definately order another one to add to it when he starts crawling. Lightening fast shipping!! I ordered this item on a Friday and it arrived on Monday.,5
"Neat Solutions 8 Pack Multi-Color Solid Knit Terry Feeder Bib, Girl","They are very large. Cover most of the baby. Neck hole is a bit big. But I do like them, they help keep her dry and clothes clean.",4
Em's 4 Bubs Hearing Protection Baby Earmuffs Size 0-18 Months (Black),"We bought these after returning our initial purchase of Baby Banz Hearing Protector Earmuffs. The Baby Banz were way too tight for our 3-month old and extremely uncomfortable with no way to adjust the tension. We returned them and instead bought these Em's 4 Bubs which are secured with a soft stretchy headband that is adjustable. They stay in place, are very comfortable and well suited for younger babies.",5
Bright Starts Sweet Jubilee Bouncer,"This thing is defective, and if it wasn't for it being a gift I definitely have returned it...the bar does not stay attached and God forbid you try to lift your baby using the bar and it comes loose. plus, the position is awkward...just avoid it please...the price looks nice but don't do it...it's super cheap in quality. Only reason for two stars is that the vibrator is good...",2
"Baby Buddy Up and Away Hammock, White","I pored over all the animal hammocks' reviews on Amazon before deciding on this one, and I'm so glad I did! The netting is super strong and I love the high-quality elastic. This allowed me to position the hammock exactly how I wanted it, and I don't worry about my kids breaking it when they pull an animal down. The hooks and mollies supplied were simple to install. Overall a great product, especially at this price!",5
Fisher Price Precious Planets 4 Piece Traditional Bumper,"fits well in the crib, no issues with it at all. the material is soft and breathable . . .",5
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","I liked all this had to offer and so I have purchased two (one currently with each daughter) and they enjoy it as well. It features several different audios to lull your child to sleep (heartbeat, rain, lullabies, etc) and also comes with three different projection images which spin and feature different animals and scenes. Both girls enjoy them and the soft blue night light that can also be turned on and off. Overall, my wife and I were looking for a sound machine that fit our girls without breaking the bank; and the munchkin provides great value.",5
"Woombie Air Ventilated Baby Swaddle ~ Choose Size/Color (Big Baby 14-19 lbs, Love Print)","The woombie is definitely NOT for my LO. It is very very tight, made me very nervous about over hearing! Also, order one size up! Runs super small. My baby is 12 lbs and the med size fit, not the newborn as the sizing Chart recommends. I would also recommend borrowing a woombie from a friend to make sure your baby likes it before purchasing. I just spent $60 on two woombies we will never use. Also, the summer one is NOT more breathable then the regular or classic woombie. It's the exact same material FYI.",1
Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy Strap - 4 count (BOY),"If you're tired of picking up toys left and right, buy a pack of these. Or two. We came back for a second set so we'd have them handy in the car, on his highchair, in his stroller and a few in the diaper bag for good measure. Super handy.",4
"Baby Starters Plush Snuggle Buddy, Blue Monkey","The item in the picture is not the correct item.  There is no bow, the collar is white and the legs don't come out from the center of the blanket but rather are sewn on to the edge.  My daughter still likes it but it is not the item I want.  I really want the correct style!!! NEED TO FIND THIS ONE IN THE PICTURE!",1
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","This was a shower gift for my daughter-in-law, something she specifically asked for.  My daughter also has one, and both girls LOVE them!",5
"Summer Infant Elite DuoMat for Car Seat, Black","We ended up returning this because the carseat inspector had concerns about anything (not just this mat) being placed between infant carrier base and the car seat. So, I decided that I'd rather be safe than sorry!",2
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ Deluxe, Blue","In 2005 we bought a Diaper Champ when our first son was born. We loved it! We recommended it to others at every opportunity. In 2010 as the birth of our second son approached we didn't even consider an alternative. We simply bought the latest version of the Diaper Champ. What an utter disappointment!* The new diaper champ is smaller. It is so small that after putting in just a couple diapers they push up toward the top and then the mechanism won't turn to drop the next diaper.* It smells! We change our diaper champ daily or every other day, yet it has a funky odor. Every time I turn to drop the next diaper down, the entire room smells. After repeated washings with bleach and vinegar, the inside still smells. Isn't this what it is supposed to be made for? To eliminate smells in the nursery?* It tips over. When you open the top to retrieve the diapers or change the bag, the entire thing tips over.Such a disappointment. I wish I could return it!Don't make the same mistake - buy something different!",1
Philips AVENT DECT Baby Monitor with Temperature Sensor and New ECO Mode,This is a great monitor.  The only problem i have with it is that you can't turn the volume up on the receiver all that loud. (may not be that bad but i do daycare out of my house and it is loud)  Other wise there is no static and is a dependable monitor!,4
"Pet Yard Plastic Exercise Pen Expansion Panel, 2-Piece, Gray","This is almost a necessity when you purchase the Superyard XT.HINT:  Do NOT buy two extensions, as the superyard becomes unstable with more than one set added (per manufacturers specifications).",5
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I love my diaper genie and there is no diaper odor, as long as you make sure the dirty diaper is completely twisted in its own little &quot;pocket&quot;. It fills up fast and you can run out of the plastic bag without warning. Also once you start a new &quot;train&quot; of dirty diapers, it's difficult to get the first one started through correctly. Overall, I love it and am glad I own one.",4
Sassy Crib and Floor Mirror,"My 3 month old son hated tummy time and would not lift his head when laying on his tummy. Once we put this in front of him, he lifted his head and reached out for the leaves, which make a crunchy noise. It would perfectly for what I expected it to do, which was to make tummy time productive. I plan to use it later on in his crib.Only drawback is that the mirror collapses easily and can fall on him if not on a hard flat surface, but the mirror is light enough not to hurt him even if it falls on his head.",5
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary",This is a very comfortable potty seat. My grandchild wanted to sit on it every time she went to the potty.,5
Earlyears Lil Shopper Play Set,"I looked at and deliberated over a very long list of toys in the ""fill and dump"" category, as I think this is a developmentally good toy for a baby. My grandson will be seven months on Christmas and I wanted this gift to be ""just right"". I chose this one because it looked so cute, and toy food can be used in so many ways. I was delighted when the package arrived yesterday--so nicely designed, and super cute! It is compact, and doesn't include unnecessary packaging. Product was made in China, but at least they got it right, and it has no sharp or loose parts or harmful chemicals. The apple has a really nice chime and other parts crinkle well, and I LOVE that you can open the milk carton and see a shiny surface like a mirror (a little wacky, but a nice surprize!) I think this toy will get a lot of use for several years to come.Recommend for toddlers, pre-schoolers or even adventuresome crawling/sitting/exploring infants.",5
"South Shore Savannah Collection Changing Table, Pure White",this was not hard to put together and has been great for the nursery.  i like that it has a lip on the front so our  little one doesnt just roll off when changing his diaper and the cubbie holes are great for little baskets for diaper cream/diapers/wipes and blankets etc.  the drawers are spacious too!  definitley reccommend!,5
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"I,like most parents,went by the look of this seat. I recieved this as a gift when my son was almost 2 months old, he was a big baby weighing 9 lbs. 6 oz. when he was born, so therfore this seat did not last long at all. The pillow, which is not removeable, was in the wrong place, it made my son's head lean forward. After all was said and done my son enjoyed the simple bouncy seat with the fish and lights. I guess if you have a very small infant, and you use it right away, you MAY get your monies worth. My son out grew it before he was 3 months old and he was 2 months when I got it.",2
Arm's Reach Mini Co-Sleeper Bassinet - Natural,Works well as a bassinet but didn't use the co-sleeper function.  Difficult to setup and take down but once assembled felt sturdy enough.  Only complaint is that it lacks 4 wheels so when moving you tend to scrap your legs/ankles against the non-wheel legs.,4
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","I'm giving this stroller 4 stars because of price to quality ratio, although I'm pretty sure my wife would disagree with me.What I like about this stroller is that it was pretty cheap and it folds very nicely in my car.What we DON'T like about it is that it is very hard to turn (you need two hands to guide it) and I keep hitting my feet against its rear wheels (I'm 5.11&#34;).",4
"ShadyBaby Universal Stroller Parasol, Rocket Dots",Great for any type stroller and I love the fact it would block harmful rays UVA/UVB.,5
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet",This is a GREAT item. A must have for all babies. At 18 months we are still going strong with it. He can now turn it on and off himself.,5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I bought this chair for my 11 week old grandson to have in the living room with me when he is over. It works great as I can rock him or he can sit up and watch TV. When he falls asleep I can put out the kickstand and he is laying down. However I have read reviews about older babies tipping over so I will get something else for him as he starts to sit up by himself but for little ones around 3 or 4 months it is great!,4
Playtex Diaper Genie - First Refill Included,"I have been using the Diaper Genie from day one and it is an awesome product. I wish I had thought of it! My only complaint is that the first few diapers don't tend to stay separated, I have gotten it to work a few times but it's tricky. As long as there isn't a poopy in the first 3-5 you put in, odor isn't a problem. If I have a poopy after I've just changed it I just take it straight out to the dumpster. No problem! It also is easy to carry for travel when you go on vacation.",4
Sassy Crib and Floor Mirror,My 8 month old loves this mirror. The entertainment is endless. We also attached it to the jumperoo which is a blast for him.,5
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","It gets very good reviews from the testing magazines, it's easy to mount in the car and my 7 yr old loves the arm rests and drink holders. It might cost a little more than some of the more common brands but the quality is there and you're probably using this daily for a few years. You'll get your money's worth out of it.",5
Jolly Jumper Sneak a Peek Sneak-a-Peek Infant Carseat Cover Deluxe Gray,The Jolly Jumper Sneak a Peek kept my baby girl nice and cozy warm. She was born the beginning of February so we had plenty of cold days left of winter but with this carseat cover she did not get exposed to the cold elements of the outdoors. I would get inside and open the cover to take her out and I could feel the warmth inside of it yet.,5
"Jumping Beans&reg; Elephant Hooded Bath Towel, in Aqua/Multi",I bought this for my youngest grandson and he really liked it.  It was very soft and a nice size,5
KidCo Peapod - Cranberry,"LOVE IT we just traveled with our 8 month old and this was perfect in the hotel room that had no crib, great on the beach, light weight and super easy to pack in the suit case and it's big enough so we can use it for a couple years as she grows",5
"36 Baby Spoon Souvenir Spoon Display Case Rack Cabinet, REAL Glass Door, (SP01-WA)",I have a smaller spoon rack and I had no idea this one would be bigger and cheaper than my small one.  It is beautiful and you will not find a nicer one for the money!,5
Philips AVENT Infant Feeding Set,"We started giving one bottle a day to our daughter at 2 weeks of age, and are otherwise breastfeeding.The first bottle system we tried was the Avent since so many people rave about it.But, it seemed as though she was dribbling out more milk than she was swallowing. I have since heard the same complaint from other parents (with both formula and breastmilk).We had much more success with the Platex Natural Shape VentAire, and continue to use that system today.This is her favorite pacifier, though.",2
"Kaloo Doudou Plush Bear, Blue",Our grandson received the Blue Doudou DC as a baby gift and it has been his most favorite toy - carries it with him at all times.  It is his blanket.  We lost it on a walk and immediately had to order one from Amazon.  He was distraught at a year searching for it.  Fortunately it arrived promptly and now we have learned that it can't go out of the house.,5
NUK Mash &amp; Serve Bowl,I use this probably everyday to mash up my baby's food. It works really well & you can leave it as chunky or pureed as you want. This is a good alternative to buying one of those expensive baby making machines.Definitely recommend this mash & serve bowl.,5
"Babiators Unisex-Baby Infant Nighthawk Junior Sunglasses, Navy, Small",Gave this as a gift and they were a hit.  Also very durable and stand up the the wear and tear a toddler will put on them.  Love the product and would give as a gift again for sure.,5
"Tiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friends","I like that this mobile can attach to the Pack N Play BUT this mobile is so boring!  It's pretty low, baby can bat at the soft toys but I almost have to say that it might be TOO low because as the baby grows bigger, it almost touches his face! I would have kept it except the motor started making a really loud winding sound after only about 1-2 months of light use.  The clamp is fine on a Pack N Play.  I would just tighten it every time you put the baby down, just for good measure.  I can see how it might fall and hit the baby's face if you don't make sure it's tight.  I also used it on a Rock N Play and it was great but tends to tilt more down and hit the baby's face.  We also have theTiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobilewhich he LOVES! I would really recommend that mobile for the crib but if you really need one for the Pack N Play, this is the only choice out there and it is decent.",3
"Bumbo Booster Seat, Blue","Love our Bumbo booster seat! We've had the regular Bumbo floor seat for a couple years and always loved it, and am just as happy with this product. Lime green is true to color on the website. Easy for our 2.5 year old to climb up into and sit down for meals. Great for a toddler who is tired of the highchair and wants to eat at the table! Buckles/straps seem to be good quality.",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat in MatrixJust bought Graco Nautilus,  diappointed.  I have a older car that doesn't have the latch system. The shoulder belt is unable to be tightened correctly, so the car seat moves back and forth as the car moves.  Also, when my 3 year old fell asleep his head had zero support and just hung forward, even in the ""recline"" position of the seat.  We had a Brittax round about prior to purchasing the Graco Nautilis.  Now, we need to buy another car seat.  We are looking at the Brittax Regent or Brittax Frontier.",1
Medela Pump in Style and New Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump Tubing - Pack of 2,"The replacement tubings from Medela are NOT free; and the customer service is NOT always that good.First of all, maybe it's because I'm a Dad.  Maybe when Moms call, they will treat you differently.  Who knows.So, I called the 1-800-435-8316 number and got to customer service. After reading all the wonderful reviews here, I thought all was going to be just a breeze and would get our replacement tubings quickly and simply.  But oh no, that was not the case.  The CS rep told me immediately in ""plain English"" --  NOT FREE TUBING! It's $10 per pair plus shipping and handling.  When I mentioned the reviews here on Amazon, she just repeated the ""pricing"" to me again.  What Amazon!!  Then I nicely asked to speak to a supervisor.  And she said: NO ONE IS AVAILABLE!!So I hang up, decided to call the number again.  This time, I directly asked the operator to get me a CS supervisor.  Interestingly, not only were there supervisors available, she could even connect me to the supervisor direct responsible for the previous rep I just spoke to!!  So there I was talking to this supervisor.  Sorry, actual names are left out here for good reasons.  This supervisor, however, also told me that the tubings are NOT FREE.  It's only a courtesy they SOMETIMES provide to some customers. $10/pair plus shipping and handling please!!!  mmmm.....In the end, she did offer to send us a pair of free replacements.  I guess I have no complaints with that.",3
Oxo-Biodegradable Honeysuckle Breast Pump Bag 50ct,"I use these bags with my Medela pump and they fit perfectly. I was originally using Medela bags but decided to switch to these after doing a lot of research. Here's why:1- My number 1 gripe with the Medela bags is that THEY ARE NOT ACCURATE!! After pumping into their bags and then making bottles later I noticed that I always had less than what I thought I'd pumped. I did a little test and dumped 1 oz of water into a Medela bag and guess what? It read 2oz! The bags are off by exactly 1 oz which can mean the difference between a fat and happy baby and a hungry, grumpy baby. This discrepancy is strange since the markings on Medela bottles are accurate. It was when I discovered this inaccuracy that I really started doing research into other bags.  WINNER: Honeysuckle2- These bags are biodegradable which I think is pretty darn cool. I'm not a tree hugger or anything but even I can see how pumping creates a ton of plastic waste with the bags. Medela bags are not biodegradable. While this wasn't initially something I cared a whole lot about it makes me feel good to know my bags wont be sitting in a landfill forever. WINNER: Honeysuckle.3- Obviously both bags fit directly onto Medela pumps however Honeysuckle hasn't released an adapter yet (I read on their website they will be releasing a universal adapter sometime in the near future) so you have to buy a box of Medela pump bags to get the adapter. I had 2 boxes of Medela bags and just accounted for the oz discrepancy to use them before switching to these bags. WINNER: Medela4- Medela bags are made of a thicker plastic which makes it easer to stand the bag up. I'm assuming the softer feeling plastic of the Honeysuckle bags are due to the biodegradability. Even though the plastic of the Honeysuckle bags feels softer it doesn't feel cheap or anything. I've never had a problem with leaking and I use a breastmilk organizer which compresses the bags so they'll freeze flat (B000K4YSVII'm always very carful when standing the bag up because I do think that if you had less than say 2 oz in there it might tip over. I simply seal it before leaving it unattended and have never had a spill. I personally prefer the softer plastic as it is easier to get the bag open and manipulate than the stiff Medela bags. Since I think this is a matter of preference I'll call this one a TIE.5- These bags have a double seal while the Medela bags have a single seal which is a little hard to close. I've never had a leak with the Medela bags because I noticed early on that you have to press really hard to seal them and they're secure if you do it right. These bags are much easier to seal but just as secure. WINNER: Honeysuckle6- I've never had a leak with either bag but I would never freeze more than 1-2 oz in a Medela bag (marked as 2-3) . As I mentioned, I use a freezer organizer which compresses the bags and with 1-2 oz the milk in the Medela bags are already all the way to the seal and have expanded the bag. I think if you were to fill those bags to capacity they would burst but that's a hypothesis I wasn't willing to test with my hard won milk. As another reviewer noted, these bags are much longer than the Medela bags which gives the milk more than enough space to expand. I pump about 4 oz per bag, press out the excess air, and freeze with not problem. The milk never even reaches the seal and the bag doesn't feel like it's expanded width wise too much either. This saves me freezer space since I can freeze double the amount than I feel comfortable freezing in a Medela bag. WINNER: Honeysuckle7- As far as price goes, these are comparable if not a little cheaper than Medela bags. I've never purchased the Medela bags at a brick and mortar store but they're going for $16.69 on Amazon right now for a pack of 50. Honeysuckle bags are going for $15.25 right now for a pack of 50 (which comes in 2 packs of 25). That's 31 cents per Honeysuckle bag vs 34 cents per Medela bag. As numbers only this would go to Medela because their bags include the pump attachment but because of the poor capacity and wrong markings, you would end up using more bags than Honeysuckle. WINNER: HoneysuckleIt's been about 2 weeks since I've started using these bags and I won't be using any other brand. Hope this helps!UPDATE: 7/13/13I'm toward the bottom of my second 25 pack and the last two bags I pulled out (not the last two in the batch) had small holes in them. I was pumping and noticed milk dripping so I poured the milk into a bottle, filled the bag with water, sealed it and gave it a squeeze. Sure enough water came shooting out through a pin prick hole toward the bottom. I figured it was just a bad bag so I resumed my pumping session with a fresh bag and the same thing happened. I still have a couple in that pack but I don't want to use them for fear of losing my hard won pumped milk. I'll be contacting Honeysuckle about this but it's probably just a bad batch. The first 25 pack I used I had absolutely 0 problems with. Just something to look out for. There's no batch number on the bag to reference.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I got this about a week ago and my 20 month old daughter loves it. We added it to out night routine and she lays down in her crib on her back to stare at the stars. She absolutely loves it. She actually looks forward to bedtime so she can look at the stars. It is also great that it shuts off after 45 minutes. I would definitely recommend this turtle!,5
Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib,"Very easy to use: large snap allows to adjust to baby's neck, covers large area (including around the neck), catches most spills and is totally waterproof. Pretty colors and patterns.Very easy to wash: goes into the washer but most of the time I just wash it with a little dishsoap in the sink. Dries within minutes.",4
Chewbeads Skinny Charles Bangle - Cobalt,These are one of the best teething products we've tried. My son loves chewing on the material and they are easy for him to hold onto.,5
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom",Pro: video monitor with two way speaking option - v helpful to soothe and calm baby by alking to him/her till you reach the cribCon: monitor goes blank without activity. Something you need to be aware of even when it is plugged into power outlet.,5
"UPPAbaby Vista Stroller, Cole/Slate","I really wanted to like this stroller, I did a lot of research on strollers and took it for a test drive in the store and was pleased with it until I took it home and folded it a bunch of times. I found it difficult, my husband did too but we can make it work after a few tries. However both our mothers are not able to fold it and my nanny has had a really difficult time folding it as well. It seems like it would be easy, just hold the button in and push the bar in and voila but not the case. You have to push it really hard and it takes a few tries to get it to fold. It's not a well thought out mechanism. I've been using it for 2 years now and I still have trouble with it. On top of that it's heavy and I have damaged the back of my trunk trying to lift it out of the trunk. For those reasons I rate this stroller 2 stars. It should be easier to fold and easier to maneuver for the amount I paid for it. Spend a couple hundred more and get the Bugaboo.On top of that the rear wheels are so widely set that you end up bumping into everything. And they are not in view when you are pushing it which is why you always misjudge the width of them in relation to the space you are trying to move through.Lastly, I was very disappointed with the rumble seat. I had purchased this stroller because I loved the idea of turning this into a double stroller with the addition of the 2nd seat attachment. It is basically unusable. I tried it with my son in it who at the time was 15 months (and on the smaller side) and the positioning of this rumble seat in relation to where the car seat hooks on to is so close that the back of the car seat was right pressed up against his face! He was not happy and I was never able to use this 2nd seat. Plus the rumble seat can only be faced inward so he was only looking at the back of the car seat and couldn't face out and see the world. Not what a 15 month old wants. I ended up having to buy a side by side double stroller.So save your money and buy a Baby Jogger City mini or spend a little more for a Bugaboo and get a much better stroller.",2
Chicco Lullaby Cloud Activity Cot Panel,"I got this as a gift and it turned out to be very helpful. I have been having problems to get the baby to sleep on her crib, but the Chicco Lullaby Cloud keeps her company, and entertained until she falls asleep. Now, I don't need to stay around until she sleeps! I recommend it for mothers with the same issue with their babies.",4
"Bebe Dubon Soft Grip Brush and Comb Kit, Colors May Vary","We got the set in a peach color which is not one of the ones in the pictures. But since we have a baby girl and i knew that the color could be varied, it didnt faze us one bit. The bristles on the brush are really soft and our baby loves o have her hair brushed. It soothes her enough to put her to sleep!",5
"Fantasy Furniture Roundy Chair Gingham, Pink",i got this in pick. the colors are bright and the chair is really soft. i loved it as much as my daughter did.. she is two and this was just the right size for her.very nice and the price is great as well,5
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","I ordered this stroller for my 5 month old son.  My husband and I like to take walks in the evenings with our son but he HATES the infant carrier!  Finally we decided to just put him in the stroller (a month earlier than industry recommendations) to see how he would do.  He did great!  The stroller comes in the proper infant position so no adjustments needed.  We have also have the Britax B-Nimble stroller.  Comparing the two strollers is like comparing apples to crackers - the BOB is far superior.  Not only is it easier to fold and unfold but it so light weight, much easier to steer and most importantly my 5 month old loves it.  He sits quietly on our walks and for the first time ever he's fallen asleep during every walk.  The BOB looks very comfortable - great for walks, jogs, zoo trips, beach walks, etc....",5
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,"My daughter will only eat fruit/veggies if they come from a pouch. Living overseas it can be hard to come by quality baby purees, so it has been a lifesaver to be able to make our own and put them in these! They work great -- no leaks, easy to fill, and easy to clean. They also freeze and thaw easily. I am very happy with this purchase! They are slightly bigger than the ready-made pouches you find at stores.",5
"JL Childress Pack 'N Protect Tote for Glass Bottles and Jars, Black",Tight fit for your stuff and not good value for money. Seems about same quality as the stuff you get free from hospital.,3
Preggie Pops For Morning Sickness- Ginger,"I couldn't have made it through my first trimester without these lolipops. The ginger taste really helped settle my stomach. I liked all the flavors when I wasn't feeling as sick, but the ginger ones were the only things that got me through those really tough mornings (and afternoons and evenings!!!)",5
Sesame Street Elmo Adventure Potty Chair,My 22 month old grand daughter gets a kick out of the sound effects and seems very comfortable sitting on this potty chair.,5
Momo Clock in Pink,"My boys love their new monkey clocks.  However, as a sleeptrainer, we have not gotten any results at all.  They figured out after the first day or two how to make his eyes open and close on their own.  And they have never bothered to stay in their rooms just because his eyes are still closed.  In fact, it actually made things worse by waking my son up with the sound of the eyes opening on a rare morning when he did not wake up before the monkey.  My younger son lost the back panel for his clock within the first week, so the controls are all exposed now and need to be adjusted pretty often.As a side note, in the picture, the clock looks blue and red, but when it arrived, we learned that it is actually blue and pink.  Luckily, my younger son didn't mind the pink, but it would have been nice if the clock had been more gender-neutral.I didn't have high expectations for the sleeptraining, although I was hopeful.  I am sure it would work with certain personalities, but my sons don't have those personalities.  They do like their monkey clocks a lot, and for that I am happy.  That said, I don't think it is worth the $40 pricetag, especially given that it cannot be plugged in and the back panel comes off so easily leaving it free for children to maneuver.",3
"Cotton Tale Designs Boys Only Hamper, Brown/White",These were reasonable and seemed more stylish than the comparisons. I bought two and they work great and are nice in person. The pattern is much more appealing in than the photo appears. They hold a lot of clothing which is what I needed as my teenager had outgrown his hamper.,4
"Dr. Brown's Prevent Pacifier Stage 1, 0-6 Months, 2 Pack, Color May Vary",I really wish I would've tried these pacifiers right away.  My daughter will ONLY take the NUK pacifiers.  We've tried 4 other types of pacifiers and she spits them out right away.  I really like that these have large air holes on the side.  Give them a try but I'd recommend early on.,4
Purple and Black Kaylee Girls Boutique Baby Bedding 9 pc Crib Set by Sweet Jojo Designs,"I can't say enough about this set! Gorgeous, trendy, and lovely color! I love this set so much it makes me want to move in my daughter's nursery with her!! Great quality, I'm sure this will last for years to come! Very very happy with my purchase! Thank you!!",5
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,"I have used these pouches every day for just a little over two months, and only put plain yogurt in for my 15 month-old son. They are easy to fill and easy for him to use. I really love the concept, but my goodness they are difficult to clean. The yogurt gets stuck in the very bottom of the pouch, where the clear part connects to the green part of the pouch. It's like a no-man's land that is almost impossible to get to, I don't even know how the yogurt gets there! I have soaked them in warm water overnight and even run them through the dishwasher but with no luck. I had to throw one pouch away because there was the most sour and rotten smell that I couldn't get rid of. I even made a last ditch effort and soaked it in diluted bleach overnight, but as soon as it dried the next day the smell came back. It was so sickening that I had to throw that pouch away. Luckily the other three haven't had any smells, but I can see a bit of yogurt stuck in the sides that I mentioned before.  Also, a small round piece on the top of one of the caps started separating and finally came off while washing it by hand. Without this piece, the yogurt can come right up the spout and out of the cap with nothing to hold it in. Again, I think this is a great concept and obviously a lot of people agree and love the product. These are much more cost efficient than buying pre-filled pouches, and I like having control of what is going in them. I will continue to use these every day, but might try another brand pouch when the time comes to replace them.",3
Baby Girl Blessing Hanging Ceramic Cross,"It's beautiful but somehow I thought it would have been a little bigger. None the less , I like it and so did the recipients mommy.",4
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Diaper Pail, White","We had never used a pail before and my wife wasn't that keen on starting to use one, but we thought we would give the Munckin Arm and Hammer Diaper Pail a try when it came up on Amazon Vine.  Our son is now 18 months old and it is the first time we've used a pail--it is definitely not on your must haves in terms of baby products, especially if you are on a budget.That being said, it is a convinient addition to the nursery.  Before we used recycled grocery bags and threw diapers away individually.  With the Munchkin we no longer have to do that.  The bags seal around a plastic O-ring each time you close the lid, and baking soda is sprinkled onto it to control odor.  It will hold about 2 days of diapers, or less if you are just too skeeved out about keeping any more diapers in one spot.  You can quickly see full the bag is by opening the front of the system.Like others have mentioned, you really have to touch the diaper a lot to push it down into the bag.  With an older baby, this really isn't fun.  Another factor to consider is the cost.  This system won't work unless you buy the refillable bags, so you need to factor that into the decision.  The bags run about $0.50 each; not terribly expensive, but more expensive than free (if you currently use plastic grocery bags).",4
"Re-Play 2 Count Spill Proof Cups, Aqua, Orange","These are my favorite sippy cups that I've used thus far. They hold a lot of liquid, the liquid doesn't flow out too quickly, and the lid is easy to screw on. The plastic at the mouth piece is durable and hasn't worn down like some other sippy cups my son has used. They have never leaked, and are great for the car. I also like the colors they come in.",5
Baby Trend Silverado Sit N' Stand Plus Double Stroller,"I bought this stroller through target and we love it! I have a baby and a 3 year old. My toddler loves it and my baby car seat(Eddie Bauer) fits just right. Easy to push and stir, a little heavy but it is a double stroller.  Easy to fold.",5
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 6 Pack Soft Bite Infant Spoon, Colors May Vary",This is not a spoon.  This is like a spoon that has been stepped on and flattened.  I do not recommend at all.,1
"Parent Units Fridge Guard, White","this works great - you have to be sure and install it absolutely perfectly....the only reason i'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that I wish it were possible to have a snugger fit to hold the door shut tighter.  I realize this isn't the designed purpose, but if you are like me it would be an added bonus to make it a perfect product.",4
"Dream On Me Zodiak Portable Playard, Grey","It's made sturdy. It's cute. It's exactly what I was looking for. Perfect size. It comes with a pad for the baby to sleep on. But I bought a 3&#34; mattress for it. Although the pad would be fine, with a few blankets on top of it to make it softer.",5
Ameda Purely Yours Ultra Breast Pump,"This is the only pump I have used, so I cannot compare it to other pumps out there. But I did a lot of research and read a lot of reviews before I purchased it.  I can actually say I am very happy with my choice...I have been pumping for 9 months (and counting) and I have no issues.  It keeps up with my pumping schedule: three times a day; I only have to pump for 15-20 minutes and I get plenty of milk for my little one.  I love the bag it comes with.  It is big and sturdy, but stylish, and it holds everything I need for pumping and cleaning, plus some other personal items.  The only negative comment I have is that the valves it comes with need to be replaced frequently if you are not careful. They are very fragile.  At one point I thought my milk supply was diminishing, but it was actually because one of the valves had torn and the pump wasn't working properly.  So I bought additional valves to have handy in case they break again. I also keep them in a very small glass container I had at home when I put them in the bag to avoid breakage.  When I started doing that, I solved the problem and haven't had to replace them again.  Very happy with this pump.",4
"Disney Baby Care Center Play Yard Featuring Pooh Characters, New Ambrosia","We had this ready and waiting for our little boy when we brought him home 9-months ago. It has served us very well ever since. The changing table was great while he was an infant, and with the storage unit that attaches to the side this whole thing served as our nursery in the living room of our tiny house. Now, it's stripped down to just the play-yard for our now-bouncing baby boy. We use it as his main crib at night when he isn't in bed with us and it's perfect! He is tall enough now to stand and hold himself up with the edge, but there's not getting out of this thing; very stable and secure. We've also found it surprisingly easy to travel with and very compact considering it's full size. It's very easy to fold up and pop back into place. Takes two hands of course, but it's as easy as five quick releases, and then five quick snaps to pop it back up. This was one of our best investments for our baby.",5
"Sassy Disney Fun Bath Tub, Finding Nemo","We've relied on SASSY for years to provide colorful, fun and useful products for our kids.  This Disney Baby Fun Tub doesn't disappoint.  This cheery aqua blue and neon green tub includes a mesh sling for newborns, two squeaker toys and a removable side tray.  Tub fits nicely in your bathtub and is roomy enough to provide lots of space for a toddler to splash while bathing.  The mesh sling easily attaches for newborns.  I tend to avoid using squeaker toys too often since they can harbor mold inside (no way to really squirt out ALL the last drops of water) but kids will adore the little Nemo toy here.  The drain plug on the bottom is a generous size at nearly 2&#34; wide so you will quickly drain and rinse the tub after use.  A really terrific tub at an affordable price.",5
Pregnancy Waist Extenders,the small one worked fine extending my pants by just a little bit. but after a few weeks I saw that the button was starting to come off. nothing that cant be fixed. I ended up getting some maternity clothes so I never used the rest of the extenders,4
Evenflo ABC SmartSteps ExerSaucer,"I bought this item for Christmas for my baby boy, and he loves it!  Unlike the one I had for my daughter, this one actually has enough toys on it to keep him entertained for more than a few minutes.  Be prepared, though... peace for you comes at a price.  Be ready with 12 AAA batteries!!  Assembly looked more daunting than it actually was.  Great buy.  Thanks, Amazon!",5

"Playtex Lil' Gripper/Anytime 9 Ounce Straw Cup, 2 Count, Colors May Vary","My daughter will not take a normal ""sippy"" cup, so I get her the ones with straws.  We used the stage 1 verison of this cup, with handles but it only holds 4 oz. Now that we said good-bye to bottles, I needed a cup that held more water and milk than 4 oz.  This cup is great for water, but that's it.  Milk or juice leaks and creates geysers.  I would skip this cup.  That's why I'm on here today; shopping for a replacement!",2
Inglesina Fast Dining Tray,Bought this to go with our Inglesina Table Chair. Fits over the arms perfectly and makes clean up a bit easier. We just detach the tray and spray it off in the sink and let it dry. It also helps limit the mess that gets stuck under the chair arms. Love it! We were also happy that we were able to fit it in the chair bag when on the go.,5
"Boon Animal Bag Stuffed Animal Storage, Blue Raspberry","Well, this is a huge improvement over the laundry bag that we had been using for our b-listed stuffed animal menagerie!  It seems pretty well made, and it holds a lot of stuffed animals.  It has become another pillow/plaything for the playroom, which is fine by me as it also means that there are a lot less plushies underfoot!  Hooray!",4
The First Years Stack N Count Cups,Cute cups for the kids to play with.  Make great bath toys.  Colors are nice.  I would buy as a gift in future,5
"WallStickersUSA Contemporary Wall Sticker Decal, Tree Branches, Leaves, Lovebirds, and Hearts, X-Large","everything came as expected.the pictures is as shown.only downfall is the stickers aren't as sticky as hoped for. At least everyday i need to rub some of the stickers that hangs off the wall.something i would have differently(that MIGHT be the cause of it) is possibly clean the call first from any dust or dirt, let dry, then add the sticker.",3
Safety 1st 46 Pack Essentials Childproofing Kit,We used pretty much everything in this kit for babyproofing our new house for our 2 year old and newborn baby. The only thing I don't like are the doorknob covers as they are kind of awkward.,5
"Pumpin' Pal Super Shields, Angled Pumping Flanges, the Best Flanges By Far in a Complete Set of All Sizes Mom Will Need",Unfortunately these don't work for me...Can't get any milk with any of them. Have to keep using the medela medium phlanges again... lots of people love these though. Also found these leading to the pump membrane deals falling off during pumping because the angle is different with these than the standard phlanges.,2
Kettler Kids Dining Chair-Blue,"This dining chair is wonderful.  It's easy to use, portable, comfortable and makes your little angel really feel like they are part of the family.  My son absolutely loves this seat!  We take it with us when we dine out---no more worry about him sitting in a less than sanitary high chair at restaurants.  I have not found a table yet that this seat is not compatible with...and I've used it on a ton of different tables.  If you have room at your dining table, this is ideal.  We have an eat in kitchen with limited space and the standard stand alone highchair was taking up way too much space.  This is perfect!  Can you tell I'm in love with this chair?  Just as a side note, it cleans up quite nicely with simple soap and water.",5

Travel Wristband - Disposable ID Bracelets by My Precious Kid - Child ID Safety Product,"This worked perfectly for my daughters (4 and 1) when we went to Disney World. I just attached to my girls leg, over her sock and it stayed the whole day in the heat, and while we were on water rides. It was perfect to have and put my mind at ease a little bit more when it came to safety. I would get them again!!",5
Bright Starts Kashmir Ingenuity Portable Swing,"This swing is so cute to start with :) Honestly I thought the picture was adorable, but it is so much better in person. It is easy to put together, folds for easy portability, is machine washable which is a huge plus, and overall, so far, it is just the best little swing. I have not used it yet, as I just got it in the mail and put it together today, so the only thing I can not rate on is functionality, but if there are any issues I will be sure to post in the future as a heads up! Only negative - it didn't come with batteries and I was so excited to test it out haha. For reference, it takes 4 C batteries. Well worth the money, so far.",5
Sassy Baby Twist and Turn Bath toy,I thought this did more than it does. One of the animals winds up and it spins around in the tub for a few seconds. Not very exciting.,3
Munchkin Five Multi Cups,These are made of the &#34;safest&#34; plastic category out there and are the perfect size for my 4 year old.,5
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Infant to Toddler Rocker, Alpha Fun","Very handy piece of baby gear.  My six-month-old enjoys rocking and playing with the toys, though he's getting strong enough to lean forward, but the seat still supports him well.  I love the feature where you can prop the seat in a recline position; we used this as a makeshift bassinet a few times.  He's not a fan of the vibrating, but I don't think that's the product's fault.  Overall I'm pleased with this purchase!",5
Infantino Activity Triangle,"This is one of my kids favorites (they're triplets).  Everyone loves it and often steal if from each other.  It spins, it shakes, play with it on their lap, play with it laying down - hours of entertainment.  I think I need another one!",5
"Skip Hop ZOOtensils Fork and Spoon, Ladybug","Now they don't even last a washing -- which is sad because my son asks for his ""doggie poon"" at ever meal. Then he points to the spoon and says ""owie"" because the doggie's face is nearly completely scratched off. I have all of the characters, and only the owl seems to hold up. We bought the bee set a while ago, and that one has seemed to hold up ok. I think Skiphop must have a new manufacturer.",1
Infantino Swift Classic Carrier Black,"I liked the price of this carrier. But it is not good for long periods because it hurts your back. The reviews I read said the same thing, but I thought for the price it was worth a try. If you are just going to use it for shot periods at a time the it is a good value.",3
"Rain or Shine Kids Pouch, Pistchio/Pewter",This pouch is a great quality and size! Perfect for unpredictable New England weather!! Keeps my baby warm and shielded from the elements unlike the bundleme pouches which get soaked in the rain/snow. Love the versatility too! It is really large. Im looking forward to using this on my stroller and with my ergo carrier as well as over the car seat. Totally worth the price moms!!,5
Sony 900 MHz BabyCall Nursery Monitor with Receivers,We have purchased two sets within 1 year for monitoring our babies who are 12 months apart.  WIthin a few months they started to make extremely loud static and beeping noises!  We thought that the first set was just a &#34;bad&#34; receiver so we purchased the second set.  They did not start out doing this!  It's not frequency interference or anything else in our home--these monitors are junk!,1
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Cleaning Brush, 4 Pack","I use it as a straw ans sippy cup spout cleaner, works well since it can bend in any which way. happy with the buy",4
"Neat Solutions Sesame Street Table Topper Disposable Stick-in-Place Placemats, 50-Count","I am a busser in a very popular, high traffic restaurant and I see quite a bit of parents use the things. i have to say, nothing frustrates me more than trying to remove these things from the table top. I know this just sounds like an aggravated rant, but over half of the tables at the restaurant have one or more square residue outlines left from the sticky side of these place-mats. These marks aren't only frustrating for the restaurant staff, but are also unsightly for the guests of the restaurant. I know that this review wont matter to most who read it, but please, before you buy this,try to be conscientious of the restaurant and the table you're about to ruin.",1
Cuisinart BFM-1000 Baby Food Maker and Bottle Warmer,"I did a lot of research on baby food makers, and didn't like the negative reviews associated with Beaba and some of the others. Since we have several cuisinart appliances that we love, we decided to go with this food maker. I am so glad we did -- it steams and chops/purees in approximately 20 minutes. I bought the oxo tot food storage blocks and love those as well. I would recommend this to anyone wanting to make their own baby food. Cuisinart's website also has some great stage 1, 2 and 3 recipes.",5
North States Pressure Mount Diamond Mesh Wood Gate,"The quality is a bit on the flimsy side but it does meet our needs, so far.  We use it to keep our dogs off the patio door screens.  Our pup isn't fully grown yet so I do fear I'll have to buy something a little better quality once she's larger.",3
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"The toy is actually smaller than I had anticipated, which is great because it makes it easier for my little guy to hold onto. My five month old loves this toy and it actually keeps him occupied enough that he falls asleep playing with it when we are out! love the ""crinkly"" wings and bright colours. Definitely recommend this toy to anyone. Only drawback is the plastic hook, not the easiest to hook and off the stroller, etc.",5

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","My son would only stand it for 5 to 10 minutes and I had to hold the bottom of his feet and push up, but that was the first several times.  He loves it now.  I always use it when walking the dog.  The only problem I have is what to do when it gets cold.  I am not a small person and the straps are at their limit, so I just checked their website for extension straps and could not find them.  This will never fit over my winter jacket.",5
"Pinzon Baby by aden + anais Cotton Muslin Security Blanket, Ski Boat","These are the best baby security blankets. They're light weight and breathable, so you don't have to worry about your baby suffocating. My baby loves to hold it up to his face when he sleeps and I am worry free with these awesome blankets!",5
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","I haven't had anything worth reviewing until now. This mobile was definitely worth it! Our son didn't have a mobile till he was about 3 months old. Once we placed this in his crib he was hooked. The animals seem simple enough be he is definitely entertained by them. He seems to also like the light projection which you can't always see if the room light is on, but some of the animals have the light shine on them as they pass by. Maybe it's because of this but somehow he becomes really amused by them as they pass by the light projection. Unfortunately, we don't have other mobiles to compare this to and I haven't seen other children's reaction to other mobiles. But I will definitely say he is entertained by his and gets very chatty with his friends. We don't put this on when we put him to bed because it would just stimulate him more and keep him awake. Definitely worth the buy. Thanks to my hubby for finding this first!",5
Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,"I have nothing to compare this mattress to. Let me state that first and foremost.Pros: It is water/mess resistant. It is firm (as they say not to let babies sleep on mattresses that are too plush). It fits perfectly in my DaVinci crib.Being a first time mom, I was LOST in trying to pick out a mattress for my daughter. I wondered if it was too hard, or if the quality was ok. So I went with this one based on other reviews and comparing them to other mattresses online. I bought a (thin) mattress pad for it. But that is my neurosis more than anything. She seems to like it just fine though, as she has no trouble sleeping at night. So I will call that a win.",4

It only harnesses to 40 pounds, which many kids will hit before the age of 4 (which is the absolute minimum age recommended for a booster seat - many kids aren't mature enough for a booster until age 5 or 6).  So, if your kid outgrows the harness before being ready for a booster, then you're stuck buying another seat to harness longer.  It is also difficult to install.  Plus, it doesn't make a very good booster either (often holds the belt too far from the child).  The only good feature is that it can rear-face until 35 pounds.",1
Fisher-Price Constant Motion Plug-In Swing - Circus Plaid,"My only complaint is it doesn't recline far enough for a new baby. My daughter loved this! I take monthly pictures in this swing so I am keeping it out untill my daughter turnes one. My older daughter loves it too! Before her sister was born (she was 14 months old) she would get in it on her own and swing. At around 20 months old she climbed in all by herself, turned the swing on and fell asleep. So even though she was about 27 lbs the swing still worked great!",4
Toopy and Binoo Ball,I received the ball promptly from sell no issues until opened the package the ball had the images smudged in places and called the company back had to wait few days but response was quick that they would send replacement if wanted or credit my account 50% of the purchased price I took the 50% off my daughter is young will not noticed any will have other toopy and bino stuff later. All in all company is great would buy from them again in heart beat.,3
UltraSoft Quilted Crib Mattress Pad,"This is the best mattress pad I've seen yet!  It is thick, soft, washes beautifully but best of all it fits the crib mattress perfectly without having to pull and tug on it trying to get it to fit only to have one of the corners pop off anyway.  I highly recommend this. I wish I'd had this from the start.",5
Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,"I've had this for about 10 days and I've been waiting to write a review because I wanted to make sure it wasn't just a fluke!  This Magic sleepsuit has been truly magic.  Our baby is almost 4 months old and was previously sleeping in 3-4 hour chunks at night with a swaddle and a pacifier.  Now that she is in this sleepsuit she is sleeping 6-9 hour stretches at night.  I've heard her occasionally startle and then she falls back asleep almost instantly. On a few occasions she has woken up but quickly fallen back asleep with a pacifier. It zips easily and is easy to clean.My only complaint is that it is sometimes difficult to get her arms in because the fabric doesn't stretch too much, and it took a while to dry.  I had to turn it inside out after one dry cycle and put it back into the dryer.  But for the sleep I am getting - totally worth it!",4

They are thicker than the other ones and you don't need to trim them either. I'm very happy with these screen protectors and for some reason I need to order more, it will be for theses. You really need to give these a try if you have a Nook HD+",5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black",I have a 5yr old and a 4 month and I love it would'nt go anywhere without it.  I can keep track of my 5yr and have the baby right there.  Great for shopping and vacations.  The baby car seat that was her sister fit right on it with no problem.  It's a litte hard to fold up but once you get the hang of it its ok.  Took it to the science center and my 5yr old could hope off and on when she got ready.  Even fell asleep on it with no problem.  It make her feel like mommy hasn't forgot about her little girl she can ride too.kay from St. Louis,4
Melissa and Doug Safari Chunky Puzzle baby gift idea,My 1 year old daughter loves this puzzle! It is colorful and very durable! My daughter eats everything...EVERYTHING! This puzzle has stood the test of time for us. She caries the pieces around with her all the time. A perfect fit for a toddler!,5
"Baby Brezza Temperature Control Kettle, White/Grey","I bought this item thinking my life would be a lot easier to make formula for my twin boys. But, this kettle does not warm to correct temperature first and worst, it does not maintain temperature at all. The temperature display shows 91, but the kettle is still in blue color indicating that the water is ready. I am returning this item and please think twice before you order this kettle.",1
"Dream On Me 3&quot; Playard Mattress, White",Fits well in the pack 'n play with no space between the mattress and the sides.  Much more comfy for my 11 month old than just the thin pack 'n play mattress.,5
"Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Navy/Red","These are great for hanging toys on car seats, strollers, bassinets, and any other place you might have a baby play with a toy. We lost a few toys to my son tossing them or dropping them while in the stoller. After I bought these, we don't have that problem anymore. Plus it prevents the toy from hitting the ground, so you don't have to worry about cleaning it over and over again.",5

"Safety 1st Alpha Omega Elite Convertible Car Seat, Lamont","I've owned many seats for various nieces, nephews and cousins. I Honestly LOVE this car seat. I own 3, 1 for my car, 1 for hubby's car and 1 for grandma. Yes it is larger but I like that, the most seat you have, the more protection you have in a crash. Thankfully I've never been in a car accident while driving, much less with my daughter but as a child I was in MANY and always was injured in some way, I feel totally safe with my daughter in this seat. I love that the arm rests come up and down and the cup holder is nice also, but we usually keep it off because it takes up more space. I love how easy it is to adjust as they get bigger and I'm excited to use this as a forward facing once my daughter turns 2. As for installation, I haven't installed it myself but my hubby has never had issues. We use the LATCH system and it works just perfectly in our 2001 Pt cruiser and obviously in our mini van. I recommend this seat to everyone and will be purchasing more if ours expire before we have another bambino. Great seat, great construction, great value. Found mine at Burlington Coat Factory for $90.",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","I don't know how anyone can pump without this product! I tried for one day and then bought this item and it has changed my life. I can write emails, hold my baby if she's fussy, and it will be extremely useful when going back to work.This bra has a large variety of sizing options. There is an extra zipper section in the front and velcro in the back to fit to any size which I am happy to use as I lose weight and drop cup sizes as baby gets older. Washing machine safe for the drips of milk that inevitably get on the bra and it doesn't lose shape or elasticity.I use my Medela pump and breast sheilds with it ever day, but I would assume it would work with any type of electric pump as you put your own breast shields in and pull them out as needed.",4
"Britax B-Agile and B-Safe Travel System, Red","We bought this travel system and extra base for our first child this August.  Overall, I think it's a great product, not perfect, but I'm happy with our purchase. Our experience has some pros and cons:PROS:The carseat snaps in the base and stroller effortlessly.Extra bases come in handy.The base is one of the easiest to latch in your vehicle according to my friends that use other brands. I didn't know we had a LATCH system until the nurse helped us install the carseat properly.  It's so easy.Stroller maneuvers great! Wheel locks keep it from moving, period. It's a very smooth ride for our baby.Plenty cover from sunshine and rain when locked in the stroller.CONS:The carseat is very heavy with a child in it.  It's 9 lbs 8 oz by itself. I recommend using the stroller whenever you can. My daughter is 13 pounds now and it has become more difficult maneuvering the seat out of the base. My husband has no problem, however.  I thought I'd build more strength in my arms carrying her and the carseat around but I didn't count on being so exhausted.We drive a 2013 Ford Explorer and our seats constantly hit the carseat moving it around and blocking the release. This doesn't happen in my friend's GMC Acadia.  We have to lean over the carseat to pull the release then wiggle it out. We obviously don't have as much room as some other vehicles.  This isn't the fault of the manufacturer but something to consider.You do have to simultaneously pull up on each side of the seat to remove from stroller, making it impossible to get a better grip on the seat; you just have to bring it in the car like that. It is a little awkward but I haven't dropped her yet.The right strap on the carseat constantly twists and tangles! I'm not sure why it's just that side.Baby gets hot hot hot! I'm going to get a breathable liner for it.  She justs sweats so easily.Limited storage space below.  I received a Mommy Hook at my shower that makes carrying purses, diapers bags, or shopping bags easier.I'm happy with the travel system despite the cons.  It was easy to get the 3 pieces together and I knew after using it a few times I would know what accessories I needed (most definitely a cup holder or the organizer).  It is a bit pricey compared to other brands but I felt this was a very safe one to go with. I'm sure others may come with larger, more accessorized strollers.  In hindsight, it may be better to get just the carseat and base alone and then a universal stroller, but I still love pushing this stroller around.  Read your instructions thoroughly! It took me forever to figure out how to loosen the straps and open the stroller when I actually started using it.",4
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"I purchased this toy hammock to place my daughter's stuffed animals in. So far, I have not had any trouble out of this product. Currently it is holding about twenty regular sized stuffed animals and shows no sign of tearing or coming out of the wall. I recommend this product to those who are tired of lining up the stuffed animals around the bed. This gives the 'friends' a home of their own!",4
Skip Hop Treetop Friends Animal Ball Trio,"My LO loves the jungly brown owl with the big eyes, mainly I think because there is more contrast in color. It was one of his early favorites and remains one of the few things that will distract him in his car seat. The owls are well made and have removable links so you can hook them to things or let them be like a ball for throwing or stuffed animal for cuddling.",5

I've used one wet bag for two days of diapers on an overnight trip.  If you close the bag tightly, no smell! I wash them in the diaper load, and they air dry super fast.  I've also used these for soiled clothes and wet swimsuits.",5
"Friendly Toys, Little Playzone with Electronic Sound and Lights","I bought two sets for my twins' 1 yr birthday present and have used it for four months.  It has worked FABULOUSLY!! Two sets joined together make enough room for the two of them and enough toys to share, and when they get cranky and fight we can separate them in their own play yard.  It breaks down easily for transport to other less toddler-friendly locations, though cumbersome for transport, they appreciate the room it gives them more than a pack'n'play.  It is easily cleaned with Clorox wipes if they make a mess on it.  They have only escaped once, when one of the connecting pieces wasn't secured all the way.",5
"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","I originally bought 2 of these gates, one for the top of the stairs and the other for the bottom of the stairs.  The one I purchased from OJCommerce arrived in brand new condition and we love it!!  It works great and I'm very happy with it.  OJCommerce didn't have 2 instock when I bought the gates so I bought one from them and another from APM2008.  The gate from APM2008 arrived damaged.  I contacted the seller who instructed me to return it.  I did, but they made me pay return shipping for the damaged gate, which I thought would be refunded since the gate was damaged.  Because the post office said the gate package was oversized they wanted to charge me over $140 to ship it.  $108 of that was just an oversized package fee!!  I said no thanks and took the package over to UPS.  They charged $77.33 to ship it ground!!  APM2008 only refunded me the original purchase price of $65.48.  They claim it only cost them $16 to ship the gate to me originally!  No idea how they managed to pull that off with USPS considering the gate is at least 22 pounds and the dimentions are approx 3""x30""x42"".  It shipped from Georgia and was delivered to eastern Washington.  Do the math yourself.  Highway robbery if you ask me!!So here I sit, robbed of $77.33 in return shipping costs all because the company has no problem stealing.So, here's a fair warning to you, don't buy this gate from APM2008.  You may end up with the one I returned!In the end, I now have 2 of these gates from OJCommerce and LOVE them both!!  They arrived sooner than expected and have plenty of packaging inside to prevent damage.  Thanks OJCommerce!!",1

"UPPAbaby Vista Stroller, Red/Denny","My baby is 3 months old now and I am so happy that I have this stroller!  My little girl has slept in the bassinet on the stroller next to my bed every night since we came home from the hospital and she is now three months old.  Target has bassinet sheets and bassinet matress protectors so she always has a clean bed.  As a result, I did not have to buy a cosleeper.  This stroller works great as a stroller too!  It is so smooth and easy to roll, there is no worry about popping a tire because of the way the wheels are made.  The super sunshade protects my baby when we are outside.  Plus, breaking this stroller down to fit in my car is so easy and fast.  My little girl is very comfortable when she lays in the bassinet while being pushed.  I have only used the bassinet so far and it has been great.  I'm sure the seat will work well too when she is ready for it.",5
"Go Mama Go Designs 24 Pack Wonder Bumpers, Blue/Chocolate","So glad we purchased these. Made the mistake of selecting a sold back crib - because it looked so nice in store, and we were thinking ahead to it becoming a bed down the road. What you don't think of NOW is when the baby starts to lift up...and FALL. While we can't use anything along the solid back (since bumpers are so strongly recommended against), I searched like crazy for something like these to cover the slats on the other 3 sides. They have provided safety and comfort through many falls thus far. Plus, got them in pink & cream to match her nursery/room, which Mom loved even more.  Relatively easy to put on (don't forget to turn zippers away from the inside of the crib), they look nice, and are truly beneficial to the baby - and the parents' peace of mind!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"What can be said that hasn't been said before?  There is a reason why this toy is so popular.  There are many shapes for the baby to chew on, satisfying wherever he/she want to reach with it.  The legs are particularly nice to reach the molars.",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","So, I initially had it on my registry list but my sister in law said the medela pump she handing me down already had some arrangement for hands free pumping, so I assumed I no longer needed. While Medela's overall products were great, that hands free stuff was awful. How many times I spilled precious that made me almost cry. At some point, I was so fed up with it that I went ahead and ordered this bra despite yet another expense. Little did I know how much overall you'd need to do to make your breastfeeding successful and comfortable. I ordered the pink color. It fits perfectly, I can keep it very snug. The fabric isn't some cheap cotton, it's some real high quality blend that feels expensive to the touch and it's a pleasure to put it on every time. I didn't even try a DIY project using a sports bra. This is IT. When you divide the price by number of times you actually have to use it, it's fraction of pennies! Now that my 10 months old decided to wean herself all I have to do is pump, and sometimes pumping takes more time than I would expect and with Medela Freestyle, I can go several other things at the same time which is perfect for a busy working mom. Can't thank enough the person who created it.",5
"Baby Deedee Sleep Nest Lite Baby Sleeping Bag, Heather Gray Lime, Small (0-6 Months)","I agree with some of the other reviewers, this is a high quality product, very soft and cozy in terms of the fabric but there are a couple down sides for us- Sizing: 2 issues #1 length - My 8 month old will soon outgrow the 6-18 month #2 - the neck area is a bit too large for my LO and does not fit snugly like it does on the pictures. the neck opening is so large that it hits him mid chest!- The Zipper is BIG, not covered at the top and difficult to get started, that's probably the worst for us. The grob bag has a flap to cover and our swaddle design sleep sack has a 2 way zipper that does not have to be started each time and is very small. It is covered as well.",3
"Goldbug Animal 2 in 1 Harness, Horse",Truly useful if you want to give your son freedom to walk around while having the security that he won't get lost in the meantime.I have just one advice with this thing... Make sure that your son understands that he is somehow tied to you.I'm telling you this because the first time my son used it he didn't realized that so when he started to walk and reached the rope limit he fall back.,5
Boken Every Day Diaper Bag in Black,the bag is definitely lightweight. it has very little structure. seems flimsy but so far it has held up. i've filled this bag to the max and it has not ripped yet. it is a large bag. i dread having to search for things in it. i just can't see deep down  in there. it does have one inner zippered pocket which is handy for small items. i wish they would have made the inside a lighter color. i would have gone with a lighter color if it was available on their website. i have the  organic ergobaby travel backpack. now that is one sturdy backpack. same quality as their baby carriers. i fill the ergo travel  backpack without any fear that it will come apart. the seams are very strong. the material is high quality.it weighs a little more than this backpack though.,3

"Stork Craft Hoop Glider, White/Mocha","I bought this for my wife as a Christmas gift and she absolutely loves it. Its easy to assemble, comfortable and smooth.

Highly recommended product!!,5
"Comotomo Silicone Baby Teether, Blue",My 11 month old isn't interested in this teether. Very flexible. Not worth the cost compared to other teethers out there. Glad I didn't buy the two pack.,2

Galt Giant Soft Book,"Super book! First our baby was intrigued by the bigness and strong colors, and lately he's captivated by the crinkling noises when he grabs and turns the pages. He loves the beep-beep of the flower petal. There are lots of colors and shapes on each insect page to gaze at, point out, tug and talk about, and the mirror is not too distorting like some other baby mirrors. This is very generously sized and strongly coloured. I've submerged it in water twice with a squirt of dish soap to wash (our baby loves mouthing the caterpillar leaf and other things) and it has stood up to cleaning very nicely. We really like this book! It would be a great gift, too. And totally appropriate for boys too even though it looks pink :)",5
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","I feel like a traitor to say this, but after two years of relative bliss, our relationship is over!  So sad.Bob was our only stroller for two years and we took him everywhere (a million flights, marathon training, beach, etc.)but then our relationship changed...What happened was= our daughter grew. Imagine that.  And around 1.5-2 years old, the canopy was way too much in her face.  I sold my 2009, and went into REI to buy the 2011 model after hearing some good things.  She sat in it for less than a minute and wanted out. It's so awkward for her. She's only going to get taller, so I guess we'll go with the Baby Jogger Summit or Mountain Buggy Terrain, since we are both runners and want our kid to enjoy being in the stroller for long stretches of time.I don't understand why BOB doesn't amend the canopy?Also, the other two have hand brakes, which is helpful for running on hills! And they're made for taller people (we are 5'9"" and 6'1"")so I think our needs will be suited better with another brand.If you are short, have a short kid, or don't run on hills= this stroller will be great for you! We loved it until our babylady hit the 3 foot mark around 21 months!p.s. this is minutiae- but the BOB was very difficult for our parents to unfold and set up after a while, it took some muscle.  I am looking forward to another brand's easier set up, for myself some, but truly for them while they watch our babe.",3

"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","We first got the Sony 900MHz monitor with receivers.  They were really great; we put the monitor in his room and one receiver on each floor. The range was really so-so since it loses signal if the baby is sleeping on the second floor and I'm in the basement doing laundry.  We had a few scares with the baby (once with a shortness of breathe and another time where we found him sleep with his blanket covering his face) so I decided to get a video monitor instead (my husband wasn't so convinced and thought I was being paranoid).  I got the Motorola monitor from Buy Buy Baby with the 20% off coupon which includes an extra monitor.  It definitely gave me a peace of mind.  I put the monitor on the nightstand next to me when I sleep and whenever I hear a noise, I just look at the monitor to make sure he's ok and if I needed to get up to fix his blanket or to comfort him.  We keep one camera in the nursery and one in his play area, and it easily lets us switch between the two cameras.  It has a speaker so if I need to talk thru the monitor, I can.  Even though our baby to understand my commands like ""Don't eat that!"", I can use it to watch and tell my husband ""Don't give him that!"". The music feature was a bit too loud for my baby.  I tried turning it on once and ended up keeping him wide awake instead of putting him to sleep.  However I get full signal in the basement wit this.  My mom takes care of my baby while we're at work and she uses the Sony monitor.  She ended up having to walk up and down the stairs to check up on him once in a while.  So the difference between the Sony monitor and the Motorola one, besides having a peace of mind and video vs sound, is that it is 1 Sony monitor (mic) with 2 receivers  vs.  2 Motorola cameras with 1 monitor plus better signal strength.",5

Razbaby Raz-Berry silicone Teethers Double Pack Both Colors in One Package.,"My 6 month old has never taken to pacifiers so when I first heard about these teethers I assumed she wouldn't like them. Boy, was I wrong! She started daycare and they had some of these. I went to pick her up one day and she was just knawing away at one of the raz-berry teethers. I asked the daycare provider if she usually chews on these and she said that she did all the time. I decided to buy some for the house and am so glad I did. My daughter absolutely loves these! We have other teethers that she will chew on, but she seems to be content with these ones for the longest period of time. We attached a pacifier clip on one to prevent her from dropping it too. Love these teethers and this dual pack is a great value!",5
"Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 8 Ounce, 3 Count",Love these bottles.  I have a two month old that I express breast feed.  We have tried multiple different bottles.  These are by far the best.  She has acid reflux and is colicky/gassy.  These bottles cut that down a lot.

"Badger Basket Envee Baby High Chair with Playtable Conversion, Orange/Blue","This is the cutest high chair I have ever seen. It is a beautiful shade of pink. I'm so sad to have to return it. This chair is a regular """"L"""" shaped chair. The back of the chair is completely flat.  It is not scooped like most high chairs. So there is little support for my 4 month old. You can recline the back. But it is still not enough support a younger baby. I know the manufacturer says 6 months. But I think it is designed for about a 1 -2 year old. I could see a little girl loving this chair and table (and as a high chair)! But the seat isn't adjustable enough for my little one. Also the fabric only connects at the top of the chair. So that contributed to her sliding down. I'm so sad because all the other chairs are so neutral in color. This one is girly like I wanted! It's just too expensive to keep till she's older and still have to get another high chair in the meantime.I just bought the babytrend chickadee style.  It also very pink and girly.  And it supports my 4 month old well.",3

We live in a house with doors from the 60s.Most of the bad reviews about these are on exterior doors being slammed or blown by wind... all I can say is they can withstand the slamming of a toddler really well.",5
Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"I have a nine month old daughter who is not the easiest to please but I have to say she has been obsessed with this toy since the first day I bought it for her. I don't know what it is that keeps her so entertained, I think maybe the fact that it's somewhat interactive but still small enough to chew on. Definitely her favorite toy!",5
DadGear Courier Diaper Bag - Orange Retro Stripe,"I purchased this bag for myself after my wife bought a different ""girly"" diaper bag.  We both loved it so much that she decided to steal this one from me and it is now the only one that we use.  The bag is very functional and roomy, and the accesible wipe holder is great!",5
Carter's Just One You Musical Monkey 15&quot; tall - Pink,"I bought this monkey and was willing to pay more because it is RARE to get the light brown one and my niece was in love with the light brown. I pay for light brown and get DARK brown! Totally the opposite. NOT pleased at all, sent the product back!",1
"Vulli 2 Pack Vanilla Flavored Ring Teethe, Colors May Vary",These teething rings are perfect for little fingers to handle. They are a good precursor to Sophie because they are small and easier to handle. My almost 6 month old loves them!! I would say they would a great first teether for younger babies.,5
"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","I got two of these blanky buddies as a shower gift for my son, who is now almost three years old.  He loves his ""buddies"" and can't sleep without them!  They are extremely soft and have withstood many, many, many washings and are still quite soft.  I love to give these as shower gifts now myself.",5
"Motorola MBP26 Wireless 2.4 GHz Video Baby Monitor with 2.4&quot; Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan and Tilt",The product does effectively met the expectations I had.It works fine and I can see the baby during the night even with low lights.It really is very good for this purpose.,5
Bright Starts Door Jumper,"We got this as a gift and set it up when our daughter was about 5 months.  She just kinda hung there, not bouncing, so we assumed she was too young for a bouncy seat.  But then we were visiting some relatives that had the Fisher Price Jumperoo--we put her in there and she was a bouncing fool!  Turns out she loves to bounce, but the problem with this, as other reviewers have noted, is that it's a bouncy seat that DOESN'T BOUNCE!  The rubber that they use in place of a spring is waaaay too thick.  I have to put pretty much all of my weight (125+ pounds) on it to even get it to flex--how is a 17 pound baby supposed to do anything?!  Also, the depth of the seat area is way too deep--it comes up all the way to her arm pits, so she kinda just looks like Frankenstein with her arms straight out (and she is 7 months old and 95th percentile for height, so she really shouldn't be too small for it).  Bottom line is that I'm totally disappointed by this product (though I do usually like Bright Starts stuff).  If you want a bouncer that actually bounces (what a concept!), skip this and buy the Fisher Price Jumperoo.",1
"KF Baby Finger Pinch Guard [Set of 5], with kilofly Refrigerator Magnet",These are really cute and they saved fingers the first day we had them. If you have a busy toddler they are one of the last things you might think of but great. Who needs to shut doors and have privacy anyway... your a parent now right.,4
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll",I love this arch-- the only thing annoying is when it's on the carseat I can't lower the little shade on the seat.  Besides that my son loves it-- although he does get bored with it at times a little more quickly  now... but it's just his short attention span:)  The flower with the mirror comes off a little easily but this was a great purchase to keep him engaged on short walks in the stroller and to bring new life to his infant bouncer seat.,4
Kids Line 8 Piece Jungle 1-2-3 Crib Bedding Set,"We purchased for our son's nursery and we absolutely love it! It's comfy, soft and compliments his nursery very well :)",5
"Infantino Tag Along Chimes, Frog and Duck","I bought these to help entertain my 5 month old daughter, and she just loves them.  I put them on her car seat, used them to distract her during diaper changes, put them around her wrist like a bracelet when she is in her bouncer or on her mat.  The packaging says to not wash them, so I held off for a while with just ""wiping"" them clean as directed.  It bothered me after it was dropped several times (especially with puppies in the house), so I just threw one in the washer with the rest of her laundry to see how it would fair.  (I figured I had two and could spare one or order more if needed.)  I'm happy to report both toys have survived many trips through the washer and dryer and they are still intact (and still chime).  It helps ease my mind that I can wash them, probably just a new mom thing, but it makes me feel better to give her toys I know are clean.",5
"Graco Pack N Play Playard with Bassinet, Pasadena",This pack N play is the perfect size. We have a rather large home but I didn't want this big brick just hanging out taking up space--the size is convenient and great for small spaces as well and it fits most standard graco pack N play fitted sheets (even after heavy washing). The mattress is more on the harder side which is great and provides the sturdiness I needed for my baby! I would recommend this product.,5
"Graco Backless TurboBooster Car Seat, Jeweled Princess","Bought this for my niece to keep in my car, it's very cute and light. She absolutely loved it! Very convenient that it has 2 cup holders on the sides.",5
Mustela Stelatopia Moisturizing Cream 6.7 ounces,"My daughter had what I thought was baby acne, but the pediatrician said it was cradle cap. She suggested that I try this cream. I was completely amazed her skin improved in just two days! Now my baby has soft beautiful skin with all of the bumps, redness and flakes are gone. I still can't believe it. By the way I tried cleaning her face twice daily and aquaphor, but no success until this. Try it.",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray",This straps onto any chair - folds up easy - easy to clean mostly (sometimes those straps need some extra scrubbing!) - easy for transport - not too big and bulky! I would never even purchase a high chair after having this and I'm using it on my second child too! Great that it can be dishwashered :) too!,5
Baby Jogger City Select Stroller with 2nd Seat Onyx,My wife picked the stroller based on the versatility of this stroller as a double stroller and other reviews. I must say it did not dissapoint. It arrived on time and in perfect shape. We are very pleased with the quality of the stroller and the ease with which it can be assembled and pulled apart. Its easy to manuever and relatively light given it is a double stroller. Also one of the other reviewers had mentioned that it fits into the Bugaboo bag and I am very thankful for that. It did infact fit very well and we have been able to transport it easily. All in all very pleased with the product so far. Though we are awaiting our second baby so have not used it yet to carry both our kids!,5
"Ebells for 2.4G Digital / wireless baby monitor, night vision, two-way intercom,real-time security monitoring","I'm satisfied with this product. You shouldn't expect high quality, but if you want something to monitor your baby it works just fine. It works fine indoors, with no interference or signal loss. Although the noise, the sound is good and you can listen even the hiccups. If you use batteries in the camera, there are a lot of noise, and this is the big handicap. The electric cable could be longer too.",4
Sunshine Kids Lock Tite Harness Clip,"We bought this to replace the original Sushine clip on my son's Radian65.  It is easier for his little hands to do, and I don't think will break as easily as the original one.  The cost was higher than I would've liked it to be, but it has proven to be worth it.",5
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary","The seat is nice in terms of the handles and the seat top design seems comfortable for sitting, but it didn't snap securely into the round toilet bowl.  When my 3 year old son gets up, or pushes on 1 handle, the seat ""pops"" up. I was afraid he would take a fall and spoil this whole potty training experience in an instant!!I recommend the Baby Bijorn potty seat instead. It does not have handles, but it is adjustable for any size toilet and I am certain it won't pop out on my son.",1
Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Activity Center,"My husband picked this for our son, and we had a different fisher price one for our daughter.  There was a reviewer talking about their kid getting stuck in the net...you have the net attached backwards.  It will &#34;lean out&#34; if you put it on correctly.  The pieces are entertaining, but I feel like it's actually not a lot for a kid between 5-8 months (when you'd use it the most) to really play with.  My son doesn't love it. Also, I feel like, for the one we had for my daughter, it bounced, and this one doesn't.  I'd say, go with one that bounces and maybe actually has less to look at and more to actually play with.",3
"Evenflo Triumph 65 DLX Seat, Lincoln","This is a GREAT car seat! We have owned and used this car seat for about two months now, and we absolutely love it. We upgraded to this car seat from the infant carrier we were using because our eight-month-old baby had gotten too big. This car seat gets excellent safety ratings. We like the infant cushion/insert that comes with the DLX; it makes our baby very comfortable and safe. While this car seat is significantly bigger than our old one, it also goes to 65 pounds. We love that it is both rear facing and forward facing and has the LATCH accessories for easy installation. It fits well in the back of our Toyota Camry (we didn't have to move the front seats). Our baby seems to really enjoy riding in it and has actually traveled much better since we started using this seat. We were worried that it would be really wide and take up a lot of space in the backseat of our car, but it isn't too huge. Adjusting the straps for growth is EXTREMELY easy to do and not at all cumbersome, like some other car seats we've seen. The fabric cover comes off/on very easily (but doesn't fall off with use or look cheap) and is machine washable.When we were purchasing the seat, we were choosing between this car seat and the Graco MyRide 65 convertible seat; we are so happy we bought this one instead! Though the Graco seat is a little cheaper, I saw it in a store and it looked really cheap (fabric cover falling off, etc). The Graco seat also looked a lot wider in the store because of the two cup holders in the arms.We HIGHLY recommend this seat to everyone!",5
"NUK Toddler Tooth and Gum Cleanser, 1.4 Ounce, (Colors May Vary)","Your typical toddler toothbush and toothpaste. After a while, my son wanted to do it by himself. Not so much because of the colourful toothbrush, but because he wanted to mimic me. I'm a happy mom, indeed.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden",I love it! Very cushiony and sturdy for my lil guy! I love the nature sounds and lights. It was easy to put together too.,5
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",This body pillow was great at first. I was 7 months pregnant when I purchased it.  I am now 8 months and the pillow has gone completely flat on both sides. This is where you need support for your belly.,2
"Lifefactory Glass Baby Bottle with Silicone Sleeve, Raspberry, 9 Ounce","I love the glass bottle, but there really is no venting with this bottle. I bought the Dr. Browns narrow plastic bottle and the internal venting system fits perfectly in this glass bottle... But that adds an extra $6 to total cost of this bottle. I only bought 1 and won't buy any more. Avent glass is vented, cheaper & less parts to clean.",3
"The Safe Sporter Water Bottle, Blue, 16 Ounce",I loved this bottle at first - it was my favorite but it stopped working after a few months - it continues to leak so much that we don't even use it anymore.  Too bad.,2
Snoogle Chic Cover - Replacement Cover in Sunny Circles,"I am so happy with this purchase - i ave been sleeping so comfortably, my cats love it, and i take it out onto the couch to watch tv so my back doesn't hurt! definitely recommend it",5
SmartNoggin Noggin Stik,"Our son reacted to it right away, came with batteries and turns off without movement. I cant wait till he can grab it himself.",4
"green sprouts 8 Ounce Trainer Bottle, Blue","This is a great transitional cup from bottle to cup and it happens to be the only one my son will drink milk from. Like some others said, the only downside to this cup is that the spout gets sucked in and has to be pulled out constantly. I have the blue and green one and both give me the same problem so I don't think it's a one off.  I like that it's a ""green"" cup and that my son is now off the bottle at 12 months due to this cup. So other than the suction issue with the spout I rate this cup well because it has served the purpose for what I need and I love that it has a cap.",5
Sassy Developmental Carrier Mirror,"Well shaped, three objects to play with and a mirror that has better quality than most mirrors in kids toys. A lot of these plastic mirrors are deformed, or deform easily. This one gives a natural reflection.",4
Serta Organic Waterproof Mattress Cover,"I'm a faithful amazon customer. This is a great cover, luxurious comfortable and great buy. It is soft, no smells and very pretty. My grandson loves it.",5
"Gund Baby Baa Ba Plush Toy, Lamb",My little cousin was in an arm cast.  She's only three years old and she could hold this little lamb in one hand AND  It's about as cute as Mia is.  Made an instant new sweet little friend,5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I'm sure that this isn't true for all babies, but my little boy (5 months) loves this.  When we're putting him in his crib he'll start to cry a little, but once we put him in this he'll start giggling.  I'm not sure why he likes it so much, but it sure is cute!",5
Sassy Earth Brights Wooden Baby's Loved Ones Toy,"Sassy makes very cute and compelling baby toys and I love that the new Earth Brights line as we are trying to reduce the amount of plastics we buy. Babies love to see photos of family, and this toy is a great way to present photos to young children. However, there are only slots for 3 photos, compared to 6 in Sassy's vinyl and plastic version. So, I would give Sassy 5 stars for using renewable wood and fabric, but only 3 stars for this specific product.",3
"Britax Marathon G4 Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","This seat is very comfortable for my Granddaughter. It is very sturdy and well contructed. It is a little expensive but nothing is too good for our little girl,",5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink",Pros:*Holds heat well*Dishwasher safe*NOT plastic*Easy for little ones to open/close*Doesn't leakCons:*The plastic on the base started spinning and seems lose*Difficult to hand-wash (too small to fit hand/sponge in)This is definitely a great way to transport hot and/or cold food.  I would recommend.,4
Northstate Superyard Playgate Light Gray,We use this as an outside/inside pen for our bunnies.  Personally for children or medium dogs I would buy three of them to connect together and make a play pen worth playing in. The one for our bunnies serves its purpose but I wouldn&#8217;t stick a kid or small dog in it for the space it offers is limited. On the other hand two of them would take up your living space quite a bit. Also if you have children it would be excellent as long as they can&#8217;t climb.,5
GumDrop Neutral Pacifier in Green / Blue,My baby loves this style of pacifier. This is a quality product and we have several lying around the house to make sure that we are never without one.,5
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Extra Tall Walk-Thru, Bronze",I love it... the dogs hate it... just as I planned. Easy installation and includes easy take-down connectors for moving it out of the way when needed.,5
Infantino Swift Classic Carrier Black,"while i was using it, i had lower backache. it should support waist level. i think it is not comfortable.",2
"Supergate Deluxe D&eacute;cor Metal Gate, Espresso","I ordered this gate from another company first.  It was made poorly, broken when it arrived and I was extremely disappointed.  I ordered it through Amazon and it was PERFECT!!!  Better quality, extremely sturdy, works perfectly, I have no complaints whatsoever.  I am extremely satisfied with this product and it looks good and gets the job done.  I'd give it more stars if I had that option.",5

Tiny Love Take Along Arch -Tropical,"We have been happily ""taken"" with our Take Along Arch.  My baby has loved it.  It has been the one toy we take with us to restaurants.  We started using it around 1 month and continue to use it today (9 months).  Initially, our little girl would enjoy looking at it, then began to bat it,  then pulled it, and now mouths and touches the toys.  The toys are removable so she can explore the textures and sounds.  When she outgrew her infant carrier we began using it on restaurant high chairs.-Happy Mom & Dad",5
Peter Potty Toddler Urinal,"The young man who this ws purchased for could barely wait for the box to be opened, as any child he was excited about his new ""toy"".  Once it was explained to him what it was, he wanted to try it. We could tell that when he ripped off his diaper, proclaimed to the world around him ""I'm Naked"" and then proceded to try and sit on the potty.  Once he was given a few seconds of instruction he used it like a pro and even remembered to ""flush""  This has been a real confidence booster for him, and a relief for us.",5
"Adiri BPA Free Natural Nurser Ultimate Bottle Stage 1 White, Slow Flow (0-3 months)","The BEST bottle for breastfed babies! My 2 1/2 month old is exclusively breastfed. I'm going back to work next week so I decided to give her a bottle 2 weeks ago to get her used to it. She was drinking from the bottle occasionally until she was 6 weeks old so I didn't think she was going to have a problem taking a bottle again, but SHE DID! I tried Born Free, Tommee Tippee, Playtex Drop-ins, Avent, and Gerber and nothing worked! I even dropped her off at my mom's house a few times and left so she wouldn't ""smell"" me but she just cried and cried until she cried herself to sleep! I was devastated! I didn't know what else to do until I was reading an article on how to get your baby to take a bottle and one of the reviewers mentioned this bottle.I found it here on Amazon and was amazed at the look and shape of this bottle! I thought it looked so much like the breast but after trying so many different kinds of bottles, I was skeptical. Still, I was desperate so I ordered it. It came in the mail last night and I decided to try it today. I had my sister feed her and SHE TOOK THE BOTTLE!!! I was even in the same room! I was so relieved!At first the bottle did leak but when I pushed the cap in tightly, it did not leak! This bottle saved my life! =)",5
"Regalo Extra Wide 58 Inch WideSpan Walk Through Safety Gate, White","After waiting forever for this to arrive it finally came.  I bought it used, but it was in great shape.  It took me a little longer to put this one up compared to it's smaller sister but I did it all by myself! It takes a while to get the tension right but I put this up without the wall cups as I rent and don't want to put holes in the walls.  I've seen people complain that it is unstable and I thought so at first too but I just kept tightening the tension until it became more sturdy.  You have to remember that this gate comes in several pieces and is not one solid gate, it is going to have a bit a wiggle.  I like that it comes like this though so if we move and don't need a 58'' gate we can scale it down.  Worth what I paid for sure.",4
"Bumkins Waterproof Starterbib, Blue Fizz","This bib is seriously too small. Other than a drooling bib (which a waterproof bib isn't needed for), I wouldn't think it would be big enough for any baby to stay clean while eating solids if they are doing so when the World Health Organization recommends at 6 months.",2
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","These are great for under clothes. These are my go on outings diapers since there so thin. But they are hard to stuff since the inside fabric tends to stick to the inserts. Also my son is 6 months old and 23 pounds and these seem to be getting a bit snug, so I highly doubt they can go to 45pounds. Other then that they never leak and all in all are really great diapers!",4
"Sunshine Kids Warm N Go Insulated Travel Bottle Warmer, Royal Blue","I bought this last week to go on a 20 hour road trip with my 9 month old baby.  We make a homemade formula for him that has to be kept refrigerated, it gets lumpy so it has to be warmed up for him to drink through a bottle nipple.  We used a tall, skinny Gerber bottle, the Sunshine Kids Travel Warmer didn't touch the sides.  After 15 minutes, the lumpiness of the milk had liquefied but was still cool.  It took 45 minutes for the milk to get warmed nicely.  The warmer is the size of a normal koozie, so if you have bottles about the same width of a soda can (like Breastflow) it will fit snuggly and probably warm faster.  It doesn't take up a lot of space, fits well in car cup holders, it travels very well.  I think it's a good buy for the price, just give yourself plenty of time to warm the bottle before it's needed, until you know for sure how long it takes with your bottles and formula.",4
"Combi All in One Activity Walker, Pink",This is cute. its entertaining for both toddler and adult. I put my tiny human in this when she was about 4 months old which I'm sure was way too young but it worked. It is descent quality the seat part is very well made but the plastic as a whole should be a little more stout. It should last though at least one child.,4
"Taggies Strap Covers, Pink","perhaps if the tags were positioned a bit lower, or the covers made longer, i'd give it 4 or 5 stars. but as it is, the tags always hit my baby's cheeks whenever the covers are positioned properly.",3
Aden + Anais Bamboo Crib Sheet - Azure Leafy - Aqua,"I decided to purchase this &#34;higher end&#34; sheet as I had thought the brand's reputation and quality would be worth it. It is pretty to the eye, but after two washes, it ripped at one of the seams. I have a six month old, so I know it isn't from wear and tear. I followed the care instructions as well. I am really dissapointed. I thought spending more $ up front for quality would save me money in the end. I was wrong.",1
"Joovy Scooter X2 Double Stroller, Greenie","PROS:*Very nice looking,*The bag underneath fits loads of things,*the fabric is very Rigid*I had it for about three years now and it still fits kids*very easy to collapse.*It folds flat and it can be fitted in the trunk of a sedan car easilyCONS:*the Orange Color is very nice but the Bottom and the Back of the seat stains and the aren't detachable so over the time the Seats will look dirty and there is go way around it.*The stroller becomes harder to steer as your kids grow bigger and you will have to get used to sliding the gear wheels of the stroller sideways to turn it, once you get used to that it won't be a big deal,",3
WubbaNub Infant Pacifier Penguin - Limited Edition,Our friends recommended Wubnubs when we saw their son's ducky. We purchased the penguin because we love the vibrant colors! It is adorable.  The pacifier is stitched into the Wubanub so the pacifier cannot be changed out.,4
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","We were so disappointed with this enclosure system we returned it the next day.  The hinge mechanism between the panels is not easy to use.  To position the panels into a circle is surprisingly difficult.  The worst part is that as I forced the hinges into the angle required I could feel the plastic flexing.  I could tell that it was a matter of time before I either broke off a plastic hinge or broke a plastic panel.  I thought for sure I was doing something wrong because this product has received so many positive reviews.  I carefully re-read the instructions, and I concluded that I was using the product as directed.  We were hoping to easily deploy and then store this enclosure on almost a daily basis.  Given the difficulty of operation, and poor design it was an easy decision to return this product.  Fortunately, the Amazon return procedure was quite easy.  I hope this review is helpful.  I usually do not take the time to write reviews, but hopefully I can help someone avoid wasting their time on this piece of junk.",1
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","We love WubbaNubs, however this one is not great because the legs dont offer any support for you to make sure the paci stays in the babys mouth.",3
Tolo Activity Shape Box,"1 year olds love to put things into things....... but they can't do the whole shape sorting thing just yet.  I got this hoping this would bridge the gap.I do like it as the shapes are easily grasped and the spots they fit into match the color of said shape, so this helps reinforce the idea behind the toy.  The different handles are fun too.My only grip with the toy is that it is difficult to extricate the shapes from the toy once they are in there.  You have to reach in, then up and around to get them all out--definitely not something the 1 yr old can do on its own.  Thus, it is a toy that needs to be played with help or the kid will just get frustrated",3
"Summer Infant Character Change Pad Cover, Butterfly Ladybug",This is much softer than I had expected but that's not a bad thing at all. It will fit nicely on the changing pad once I get it. Highly recommend.,5
"Born Free Drinking Cup, Colors May Vary","Initially, I thought I liked the bottle. After 2 days of using it, I regretted buying them. Luckily, I only bought 3 (Drinking cups). Such a shame because I would have liked to continue using them (because they are BPA-free).  The other reviews talk about leakage and they were right. The spout hole gets bigger, quite easily, not with normal usage I'm sure, but with chewing. The Drinking cup has a hard spout but unfortunately, not hard enough for both my girls (3 yrs and 1 yr). They both like to chew on the spouts. Only Avent sippy cups have survived their teeth...I found assembling them a chore after using the Avent sippy cups. Takes much longer to wash these (has more parts) than Dr Browns bottles which I've used and hand-washed for more than 2 years.Same number of parts as Avent cups but the Born Free cups has more 'nooks' to clean.Perhaps I expected too much from a cup that cost $10.99(Babies-R-Us).....",1
"Re-Play Divided Plates, Aqua, Green, Orange, 3-Count","These plates are bright, easy to clean and have helped my son with his messy meals. They do not go in the microwave but that is ok because we try and not use it with our sons food.",5
PRIMO Infant Bath Seat (White),"This seat is just what I was looking for. For my first baby I got the whole baby tub with all the colorful gimmicks... which I never used. It was alright, but the kids slumped to the side in it. When I had my second I wanted to bathe them together, but the baby tub was too big to put in the big bath tub and have any room left for the 2 year old. In comes the PRIMO bath seat. It fits perfectly in one end of the tub. My little guy is 25 inches and 15 pounds and it is still quite comfortable. This would also work on the counter for those first sponge baths. Our sink is pretty small, so it wouldn't fit there, but it would in a bigger one.",5
"Disney Sophia 4 Piece The First Toddler Set, Sweet As A Princess","My 3 yr old has two disney princess bedding sets for her toddler bed.  the cinderella one (which is SUPER SOFT) and this one.  This is not as soft as the cinderella one (and if i could find adult bedding as soft i'd own it) but this is perfect for her.  she loves it, its soft enough and keep her warm enough at night.",5
Eddie Bauer On The Go Organizer,"My brother purchased this as a baby shower gift for us.  It did not work well with our Britax B-angle stroller.  Because the loops go around the front of the handle, instead of the sides of the handle, it swings back and forth as you walk.  It is quite annoying.  I'm assuming this works on some strollers, but not the Britax.  I suggest you instead buy the Britax brand stroller organizer, it is fantastic!",1
Lil' Topper Sipper Caps,What a great idea!!!  Our daughter who is 16 months old always wants to drink out of our water bottle.  Which of course means wearing more than drinking.  She will now drink water out of her own bottle with the Lil' Topper.  So many people ask us where we got it and want to get one right away.  It does leak a little sometimes and once in awhile she gets a little too much water but overall it is a great product.,5

The one I've been using is U-shaped but uneven, so each time I turn over I need to turn the pillow. However, it also has an ""ear well"" - an indentation that keeps my ear from getting sore while sleeping so much on my side.I had hubby buy the Leachco for me so I could have one big pillow that doesn't need to be turned over in the night. I love it so much - EXCEPT that my ears start hurting in a matter of minutes. I've tried making it work for a couple of nights, but I'm starting to lose hope - I just end up with this other small softer pillow, in the middle of this huge leacho thing that just isn't working out :-(This pillow would be SO PERFECT if they added that ""ear well"" feature!",3
"Stork Craft Portofino 4-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib and Changer, Espresso","Got this for grand baby, real good quality, it has lots of parts to put together. Be prepared 2 hours set up time",5
Safety 1st Oven Front Lock,The Safety First Front Lock was just what I was looking for; 1) Cheap 2) Simple to operate 3) Easy to install 4) Installation did not require modifying my oven (drilling holes and such).  I have twin boys who are 16 months old that love to open everything and explore.  This lock has withstood both boys pulling down on the oven door handle at the same time on multiple occasions.  I know some reveiwers have said the adhesive tape did not stick well for them.  All I know is I cleaned the heck out of the area I applied the lock to with degreaser and then used a damp cloth (with water) to wipe away any residue left by the cleaner.  Has worked like a charm.,5
Maya Wrap Baby Sling - Medium - 58 - Solid Olive Green,I have used pocket slings with my second child and wanted to try a ring sling with my third since I had heard good things about it. The best thing about the ring sling is that it's completely adjustable so you can continue to use it as the baby gets older. I love not dragging the car seat into the store and the baby loves to cuddle and sleep while I shop. (You'll get a lot more things done with a quiet sleeping baby vs. a screaming child). It folds up small enough to fit into the diaper bag so I have it with me all the time. I get tons of compliments on it and people want to know where I got it. I also think it's made the baby cry less often because once he started holding his head up I would put him in this sling even around the house to keep him close to me for the majority of the day. I did this with my second child as well and both babies were so mouch calmer than my first who spent a lot of time in the swing and infant seat. Nursing in it while walking around was kind of awkward for me but I could sit down somewhere and use it as a nursing cover. You can also open it up and use it like a blanket if you want to sit baby down somewhere.,5
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"The Bjorn is a wonderful invention!  With my older daughter, we lugged her around in her car seat until my best friend bought me one of these.  That's what best friends are for...  My oldest was a large baby but we were able to use the Bjorn until she was about 20 lbs and she started to be too heavy to comfortably lug around.  There was still room in her Bjorn but my back just couldn't handle too much more.Now, I have a 2 month old who was 2 month premature.  Fortunately she is finally large enough to put in the Bjorn.  This allows me to chase my oldest around the house or put my oldest in the shopping cart and shop in relative peace.  The little one (in the Bjorn) falls asleep almost as soon as she's put in it.The only problem I have (if I'm by myself) is getting my oldest out of a shopping cart.  Your field of vision can be a bit limited with the Bjorn with baby on and your leverage to get the older one out of a shopping cart is definitely decreased.  I found that out at Babies R Us last night.  Had to ask someone to help my get my oldest out of the cart since I couldn't lift her in front of me with the youngest strapped on.Overall this is an awesome invention and very comfortable and easy to use.",5
"Disney Soft Spout Sippy Cup, Cars","Good value. Great for toddler lunch boxes and on the go, as has a locking position to prevent spills, But toddler will need to ask for help to move to unlock position - that can be either a plus or a minus depending on your needs, but its a plus for me.",5
Kids Easter Egg Baskets by Bearington Collection DUCK,"Adorable for my three-year old granddaughter.  Doubtful that handle will last more than one season; however, the size was sufficient for the eggs she found.",5
"Disney Recliner, Toy Story 3","We purchased this chair for our 3 yr old, and it is impossible for her to recline it, maybe it is defective but not worth the 49.95 that I paid for it.It came in a huge box that was very beaten up but I dont think that had anything to do with the reclining feature it is simply u sit and have to push your body back to get it to recline. I have to lay it down to pull the leg portion up to even open it for her.",1
Baby's My First Photo Album of Family &amp; Friends,"This photo book is great with my 11 month old.  He can put it in his mouth, or flip to the back that has a mirror.  He loves looking at it and laughing.  Seems very safe for this age group.",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red","I have used this carrier for 4 years with 3 kids. In short, it is great to use with 0-6 month olds but is not too comfortable thereafter. And after 2-3 years of use, the clips can become a safety issue.THE GOOD:-Ease of use. The design of this carrier is so ideal for new parents, new baby wearers, grandparents,etc. Adjusting for a different wearer is easy, both short and tall people do fine with it, and you can get it on and off gracefully even if you're not a pro babywearer. Great to throw in the car for errands.-Facing out option. Some babies simply dislike facing in, and many popular carriers (like the fantastically comfortable Ergo) do not allow for facing out.-Got a drooler or &#34;spitter&#34;? You can buy drool pads for this carrier and wash them, and the carrier itself washes up well. My second child basically kept Oxi-Clean in business, so I have good experience with this facet of baby carrier use!THE BAD:-Lumbar support becomes an issue, in my opinion, at about the 15 lb. mark.-Because of this, the lifespan of this carrier as a comfortable option is short.THE UGLY:-Sometime into using this carrier with my second child, one of the side clips began to spontaneously loosen. Yikes! Major safety issue there. As easy as the clips on this carrier are to use, consider other carriers with more of a safety feature on the clips (like Beco carriers, which are my favorite).Do I still use this? Yes, sometimes, but with caution, and not for more than the first few months. If you want a soft structured carrier with good versatility in carrying positions (and that allows facing out), I would recommend the Beco Gemini instead. Hands down my favorite carrier and still going strong (and safe!) with child #3.",3
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","We installed this gate at the top of our basement stairs (door-less) to keep our blind dog from taking a tumble down.Installation was a breeze. You can install either with screws (actually mounting the gate to the wall) or just use the adjustable &#34;feet&#34; to hold it in place with tension. If we'd been child-proofing I probably would've gone with full mounting, but in our case the latter was fine. It's really very stable just &#34;wedged&#34; in there, with the rubber feet gripping the wall solidly; I really have to push pretty hard on it to get it to move out of position.I've seen a few reviews stating that the gate won't fit certain widths, contrary to what it claims. Maybe I got lucky but I didn't measure my opening and it fit (using the extensions) with no problem.I like that the gate opener is not too easy to open. If we DO have a small human in our house in the future I'll rest easy that he/she won't be able to pop the gate open accidentally just by messing with the handle. It actually takes a bit of coordination and strength to unlatch it (but not so much that it's annoying)I think this gate is a fine value for the price, and does it's job well. Just be sure to check that it will fit with your particular situation!",5
Sassy Bathtime Pals Squirt and Float Toys,"These were just creepy looking, and ugly colors. I couldn't even tell what creature they were supposed to be. I sent them back.",1
"Summer Infant 3-in-1 Potty, Hippo Tales","Love this potty. My son is just starting to potty train. He looks comfortable when sitting on it, unlike most potties that have hard plastic seats. Perfect size. Easy clean.",5
DaVinci Sleepwell Willow Natural Coconut Palm Crib Mattress,"Just received our crib mattress and I am thrilled. I had done a lot of research and wanted something natural for baby but was hesitant to spend 300+ for some of the more common natural brand mattresses. I also wanted a mattress that would be a snug fit, and while most mattresses say they are &#34;standard&#34; there is a huge variance between sizes! This mattress fits perfectly in my Babyletto Hudson crib with no gaps, but is still easy to get in and out of the crib! I would highly recommend this mattress!",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","This is a great booster seat with a removable tray.  It also has a cupholder that snaps right on to the tray.  Because the tray can be unsnapped, you can use this as a booster seat for your older kids.  Cute colors, too.",5
Kids Line Organic Willow Hamper,"This laundry hamper looks nice and matches my nursery, but the frame fell apart after a couple months and the net bag that comes with it had holes along the seams after only a few uses.  The frame can be fixed yourself with some wood glue... it seems it was only stapled together at the factory.  The net bag you will either need to replace or do without, sooner rather than later.  The quality of the fabric portion of this hamper seems good and I have no complaints about that.  Overall, however, I think this hamper is more trouble than it is worth.",2
Fisher-Price Baby Papasan Infant Seat Nature's Wonder,"We got the baby papasan as a shower gift, and we have loved it so far!  Our daughter is 5 months old, and she still loves to relax in it!  It's cozy and folds up really easily for storing.  It does tend to eat batteries if you use the vibrating seat option with the music, but it's worth it!  The cover is fairly easy to remove and wash, and overall, it's a great product!",5
OXO Tot  12 Piece Baby Block Set,"I purchased these after much research and I give them 4 stars. I had a cat that was very sick so I was making her homemade food and needed food in small doses for syringe feeding. I wanted containers that were convenient but most importantly, ones that were BPA, pthalate and PVC free.It's nice that these are stackable and even though I didn't read the description carefully enough (I thought all the cubes would be the small size but am now grateful for the larger ones!) I am mostly pleased with these.My biggest complaint is that the insides of these have scratched (thank goodness these are free from most VOCs) and turned into a &#34;milky white&#34; in places. I've only ever used food, plastic syringes and stainless steel spoons in these- never anything sharp or jagged. I don't put these in the dishwasher- I prefer to wash them by hand. I occasionally use them in the microwave but always with the top off.I did use these multiple times per day every single day for about 2.5 months so maybe my over-use of them has caused the scratching.They're still perfectly functional so I'll keep using them.I would recommend these to anyone who needs to syringe feed a sick pet (cat or small dog) for mixing and storing food. I don't have kids but I imagine this is perfect for people who make homemade baby food as well.",4
"Munchkin Click Lock Super Suction Bowl, Yellow/Green",The suction up on this bowl works well with this bowl.  It is supposed to work with other flat bottom plastic bowls but we found that it works best with the bowl in the set.,4
Medela 150 Ml Colored Storage Bottle Case of 10,"They look the same as the bottles that come with my 2013 Medela breast pump.  I like that the writing on the side is in color b/c I think it makes it a little easier to read.  We have found that the bottles are better for us than the bags.  This is for several reasons:1. Our freezer has a top drawer that these bottles sit in nicely in an upright position.2. I don't store a lot of milk in the freezer (only about 8-10 bottles) so the bulkier bottle is not an issue for us.3. I don't have to mess with trying to pour milk out of the bottle and into a bag for storage.4. Easier to transport the milk home from work.5. We have a 3-year-old and the bottles are simpler for carrying milk to the playground, etc. (in a mini soft-sided cooler)6. My workplace has a ""sanitizing machine"" that uses boiling hot water to sanitize dishes so cleaning the bottles is easy.When I was researching storage options, it seemed that people who preferred the bags liked them because it was a less expensive way to store a lot of milk (b/c of overproduction) and/or because the bags will defrost quicker.  In my case, I only freeze milk on Friday and rotate through milk that I take out of the freezer on Sunday night.  On other days of the week, my baby eats the milk that I pumped the day before so it isn't really ever stored long-term.  I don't really have a store for ""just in case"".  The only time I've needed to pump and dump was on my birthday and I planned ahead for that.  Also, we have a box of formula packets for ""just in case"" though we haven't really needed them yet.",5
"aden + anais Easy Swaddle Blanket, For The Birds Owl, Small/Medium",great fabric. Good for winter because it's not to heavy. Will use if for summer too with a light onsie underneath. There are several snaps for growing baby. We like this better than the Velcro ones.,5
Jeep Linkables,Strong and durable.  Nice bright colors.  Enough of them so we can have some for the car and for the playroom.,5
"Britax Advocate 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I bought this after the Britax Boulevard 70CS I already owned was discontinued before I could purchase a second. Since the Advocate replaced that model, I decided to buy it.  Installation was easy, however my husband and had a lot of difficulty loosening the straps after they had been tightened. This doesn't seem to be as great an issue anymore, but I have no difficulties with my other seat.  Otherwise, the seat is well-made, has wonderful safety features, and is definitely worth the price.",4
Graco Tot Wheels V Mobile Entertainer Center,"we bought this walker when my son was 4 months old. he loved the activity tray right out of the box and tried to eat the star and rocket. we lived in a small apartment at the time and he could only go backwards at first in our very tiny kithchen. when he was 5 months old we moved into our new house which has mostly tile and watch out! he was going everywhere and giggling the whole time. when his legs got a little stronger he could even go on the carpet. we never had a problem with this walker. we could easily remove the seat to wash it, the stoppers always worked, and when it was time to adjust the height it was easy and worked just fine. even at 10 months when he could walk he would still push the walker from the spoiler or play with the activity tray in front. he never got hurt (i would watch him always) he never got bored, and only our cats were bothered. this  walker is worth any price. i finally put it away when he was about 13 months old (he still played with it from the outside for 3 months after he could walk) and am saving it for the next baby!",5
Combi City Savvy Claret,"Very light and compact, I like how it folds. Butthis stroller does not maneuver well without the use of both hands or one hand placed right in the middle of the handle bar.",3
"Safety 1st Guide 65 Convertible Car Seat, Victorian Lace",We have a Subaru Impreza and this car seat fits comfortably in our back seat.  Before this we had Graco infant car seat which didn't give us much room if I'm sitting in the front passenger seat cause the carseat was a bit bulky.  This one works fine though even if it's for a bigger baby.  It's a nice design for your baby boy.  He seems very comfortable there.  The price is great too!  Overall pretty happy user...,5
"BOB Sport Utility Duallie Stroller, Orange","Great stroller.  Folds up fairly easy; need two hands to lock it closed when folding and transporting.  Takes up fairly little space given the size of the stroller.  Nice hand break for going down hills fully loaded.  3 Year old loves the sun shade; she can pull it down almost completely to block the sun and the seats recline pretty far for a nice nap on the walk/jog/run.Only complaint, if it can be a complaint - the front tire being fixed (non swivel).  Good for jogging/running but somewhat agitating for just around the neighborhood.  I think the wife and I will just have to get used to it :)Definitely worth the money!",4
Levana Astra 3.5&quot; PTZ Digital Baby Video Monitor with Talk to Baby Intercom 32006 (White),It works as it should.The image is good to do a quick check on baby. There is one step zoom.The commands are a little trick to understand initially but no problem after all.Intercom works fine with clean sound.the chargers are identified for the camera and the screen.,4
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,I love this pump my grandma bought it for me while I was expecting my daughter and it has been worth every penny I started pumping when I was in the hospital with my daughter the day after she was born because she wouldn't latch well and I didn't want her to get jaundice from not getting enough milk. I've been exclusively pumping for most of her two weeks of life so far and it's working out really well even though some people will tell you that you can't exclusively pump with a pump that isn't hospital grade because you can't keep your milk supply up that isn't true at all. I'm producing more than enough and my daughter is just 18 days old.,5
Bink Link Pacifier Attacher By Fruitabees - Skully,"After one use, I was unable to close both the clasps and the product was completely useless. I would not recommend this purchase.",1
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","I like this bathtub-size better for babies because there is more room for them to lounge in, get bathed in, and feel the warmth all around them.  I prefer this to the others i.e. one that is almost as large but has a smaller insert that can be used for the infant.  More work and more surface area to keep clean.  This is practical.  It's the cat's meow!",5
Montessori Organic Wooden Baby Toy Gift Set,My 5 month old guy loves his wooden toys. I love that he's gnawing on wood and not plastic so it works out good for both of us.,5
"Baby Doll Bedding White Cradle Mattress, 15X33","My daughter wanted to use a cradle that had been in our family for years.  The original mattress was pretty disgusting, so I was very excited to find this one, which fit the cradle.  It's a nice quality...a little thicker than some.  I paired it with a bassinet sheet I also found on Amazon for the perfect restoration.",5
Kidswitch Light Switch Extender- 3 Pack,"When we were visiting my parents house my oldest son just couldn't reach the light switch! It's an older home and the switches are up very high. This helped him be able to turn the lights on, on his own. We are very happy with this! I love that it glows so he can see it when it's dark. It has been so very helpful and I would use it again and again.",5
"Philips AVENT 11 Ounce BPA Free Classic Polypropylene Bottle, 1-Pack",My son has been a silent aspirator since the day he was discharged from the hospital . These are lifesavers. We had to thicken his milk and these were the best nipples. They are very durable and I highly recommend them.,5
Customer Baby Bedding - Brown Zebra 13 Boy Girl Crib Nursery Bedding Set,"I ended up buying this on a different site because the shipping isn't included even with a prime membership! I must say, although this is not a set I would normally pick out (let the hubs pick) I am pleased with it. Alot of pieces for the price and they don't feel all ""starched"" and hard. I like that the blanket has a velvety touch to it. The orange in this set is sort of a burnt orange which is really hard to find a matching color to try and offset so much pattern and just throw in a plain piece here and there. I paired this set with cherry wood furniture and it matched great. All in all I really can't complain about the set nor the price considering all the pieces are there.",4
Green Camo Fitted Crib Sheet for Baby and Toddler Bedding Sets by Sweet Jojo Designs - Camo Print,This product is way too much. I thought stuff wasnt so much on here but I found this exact same sheet set for $20 at target!,1
GEENNY Musical Mobile For Boutique Western Cowgirl 13 PCS Crib Bedding Set,"I got the mobile along with the matching bedroom set and I just love it. It's super cute and can't wait for our little one to get here and use it. It plays music and the pieces spin just like a normal mobile. I thought about giving the product 4 stars vs 5 is because, even though it was simple to figure out, it did not come with any instructions which might frustrate some people. I was able to look at the picture of the product and put it together that way. Enjoy!",5

Baby Einstein Take Along Tunes,"This is a cute toy, sort of like an iPod for a baby. And, as others have noted, the music box is not annoying. I don't think my granddaughter will be a genius because she has it, but this is the best &#34;noisy toy&#34; I have seen.",5
Balboa Baby Nursing Cover Solid Brown with Floral Trim,"The first time that I returned this, it was because the neck opening was deformed and I could not straighten it out.  (It was bent in two corners and formed a squared U shape versus being a nicely curved U shape... as it should be.)  I returned it on Amazon and bought a second one (since it could not be exchanged).  The second one was slightly deformed and so I returned that one as well.  I decided not to keep it or get a third one because a mom mentioned that the dark brown color prevented her from being able to see her baby when she is in a low lighted area.  Also, the brown would not be ideal for summer time since it gets so hot inside.  I had also bought a yellow one and that's the one I kept.",2
Sassy Look Photo Book,"My son received this as a gift from his Aunt for the day he was born. He has been looking at it & teething on it since he was able to hold things in his hands (about 4 months old).

Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"My 5 month old LOOOOVES this jumperoo.  I bought an exersaucer first and he liked it, then went out of town and Grandad had a jumperoo...and he looooved it...so, we had to come home and buy one.  He likes the bouncing action much more than the stationary exersaucer and the seat is more snug so he has better body control.",5
Safety 1st Secure Lock Bed Rail,"I've tried a few other bed rails at relatives houses, and nothing compares to the security and fit that this one offers.  It may be a tiny bit hard to set up but once you have it set up it is super easy and fits great!  There are certain ""tricks"" to it, like you don't have to rise it all the way up and out of it's socket to change a bed, a little rise and you can get the sheets out and it makes it so much easier!  It is a quality product, sturdy and smart.Oh, and I found it for $29 at Burlington Coat Factory Baby section on their website.",5
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","My baby didn't like baths so this was a huge help. With this, he could lie down comfortably while I clean him up, I don't have to worry about him slipping around. It fits our sink perfectly and while the color has started to fade but it still serves its purpose. The hanger is very convenient, i just hang the whole thing to dry and it's ready for the next use.",5
Little Ladybug Wall Decal Stickers by Sweet Jojo Designs - Set of 4 Sheets,"After searching in stores & not being able to find these, I decided to check out Amazon.  I was excited to not only find Lady Bug decals, but the very ones that matched my great-granddaughter's bedding & curtains.  They arrived quickly, were affordable and look adorable on her walls.",5
Kidco Y Spindle,"I'm sure the product would work great if you have a KidCo gate. Unfortunately, when I purchased this, it did not state anywhere on the listing that it was for use with KidCo gates only. It did not work with my Regalo gate, and I had to send it back. Hopefully they will change the item description to state that this product only works with KidCo gates. We ended up using heavy-duty zip ties to attach the gate to the spindle. (Our gate is at the BOTTOM of our stairs.)",1
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White","I have this gate up in my home to keep my dog locked up during the day. He is a 70 pound Black lab, and this gate works perfectly for what we need of it. The gate opens and closes to prevent us from having to step over. I think this product is very handy and works great for the price.",5
Mommy's Helper Tip Resistant Furniture Safety Brackets,"I researched all kind of furniture brackets before deciding on these.  They work well and do the job.  I can unhook them to vacuum behind the furniture, but they are secure and keep our daughter's dresser in place when installed.  Nice product!",4
"Britax Frontier 90 Booster Car Seat, Zebra","Bought this on instructions from my son who resides in Sweden but who needed a car seat for his three year old while visiting in the USA.  Swedish standards are apparently stricter the USA standards.  He researched seats extensively and determined that this was the least expensive seat that would meet his standards.  He specified this particular model, not just the Britax brand.  We found it relatively easy to install in the family car, easy to belt-in our granddaughter, and easy to clean after she left.",5

"OXO Tot Sprout Chair, Orange/Birch","Easy to assemble and nice looking. Easy to adjust heights and foot rests are nice for the parents too so you have a place to put your feet when leaning in to feed your baby. I did think that the pictures made the cushions look cushier than they really are. I am really glad there is a non toxic high chair out there and it seems really sturdy. The cushions are removable too so you can clean all of the chair. The only thing that could be better is more of a lap restraint instead of the upper harness. I just don't like all the upper extremity restriction, personally.",4
"The First Years Compass B540 Booster Seat, Abstract O's","This chair is a must have for travelers or in cases where you need to easily move a chair between cars.  We needed something easy to travel with, but our little one was not big enough to go without the full back booster yet; this is perfect.  We get the safety of a full booster and the travel size of a half booster.",5
Lamaze Garden Bug Wrist Rattle &amp; Foot Finder Set,"I received this product in the mail today, I can't say that I am thrilled with how it arrived. The pieces were loose and in a plastic bag, they were not in any type of professional packaging and was concerned they were not new. I washed them in the wash before letting my daughter use them. Had I ordered these as a gift, I wouldn't have been able to give them out as they simply came in a regular zip lock style baggy. That is very disappointing as the product itself is cute and my daughter really likes them. We use them while she plays in her play gym and during tummy time they are helpful and she finds them enjoyable.",2
Medela Swing Breastpump,"It is a great, small and a light pump. However I find that it leaks a little around the valve it you turn it at 45 degrees angle. I also wish it was stronger as I still have to squeeze my breast to get the most milk.",4
Double-Touch Plug 'N Outlet Covers - 2 pack,"I found this product worked very well in my situation.  We wanted to plug a lightweight extension cord into an outlet that is near my 2-year-old's crib for a few weeks for some Christmas lights in the hallway outside his room, and I was afraid he'd lay there in his crib and play with the cord.  With this on there, he can't get two hands in the right place to open the cover and pull the cord out.  I'm not going to say it's totally childproof or a permanent solution, but in this particular situation, it does the job.So I have pretty standard outlets with a single screw in the middle.  Installation took about 3 minutes, would have taken 2 minutes except I forgot to put the outlet cover plate back on the first time.  I find it easy enough to lift and close the cover, it takes fairly gentle squeeze from both sides simultaneously with lifting with the other hand.  Maybe a clever or determined child could figure it out but so far mine haven't even tried.This will not work for you if you have anything other than two outlets (top & bottom) with a screw in the middle with a standard thread (I think it's #6-32).  So if you live in an old vintage house with sideways outlets on the baseboards or whatever other non-standard configuration, this product will not work for you.  It will also not work for you if you're plugging in a large three-pronged straight-on plug or one of those big fat round heads, or a DC wall adapter, or any other sort of &#34;large&#34; plug.  It will be a problem with any heavy-duty cord that can't bend into a fairly tight radius.  This is fine if you're plugging in a basic lamp with a two-prong cord, or similar with a typical light-duty two-prong plug.  It would probably also work for a right-angle three-prong plug although those aren't so common.",4
Playtex Embrace Breast Pump System,bought this pump when i was pregnant with my daughter 3 yrs ago. i then let my sister borrow it with her son and i now have it back for my 2nd daughter and it is still goin strong. when i got it back from my sister i called to order replacment cups and playtex overnighted them to me free of chargh. well worth the money.,5
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty","Was researching many different convertible car seats for our 2001 Subaru Forester.  This SUV is rather on the small side, especially in the rear seats and no latch system (belt only).  I took the results from multiple baby car seat review sites and compared them to each other in terms of features and size.  Even going so far as to check the SubaruForester forums for other users with our model vehicle to see if there was a  preferred choice.  It basically came down to this Recaro ProRide & the Britax 70-G3 series (marathon, boulevard,...).  Both offered virtually the same features, but I liked the side protection on the Recaro series more than the Britax series; the fact that it was a bit cheaper was icing on the cake.  I was worried about the size, but in the end the seat did fit in our small suv and I was able to secure it (admittedly with some haggling) into the middle section in the rear seat.  Love the adjustable features and even more our toddler loves it more than her previous car seat (always a bonus).  It does take up a sizable amount of room, but still allows us to move both front seat as far back as we want.  Pretty happy with the purchase so far.",4
Playtex Ortho-Pro Silicone Older Baby Pacifier,"Upon my sister's recommendation, we tried these out.  Our son loves them.  When we lost them (can you ever have too many pacifiers??), the local Walgreens only carried other brands, so that's what I bought.  Ended up being a waste of money--my son definitely preferred the Playtex Ortho pacifiers.  I think nursing babies must like them so much b/c they're relatively flat and very pliable in their mouth...like their mother's nipple.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,"This hands-free gate works when you step down on the foot paddle which causes a latch to open. You can then push the gate open with a hand or a knee. The gate is fairly easy to install (a necessary slim wrench is included in the box) and requires no screws or glue. The gate provides good protection. The bars on the gate are well-spaced so even small infants shouldn't be able to crawl through. When properly installed, it provides solid protection, although (important!) you should regularly check it to make sure it's securely affixed to the door frame. Also, over time the gate tends to bend a little, so you should use the little wrench-like tool to adjust it when necessary.In short, a very good gate for keeping kids out of a certain room. But this is *NOT* designed and should never be used to guard the top of a stairway.",4

"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy",The Bob Revolution SE is a great quality stroller and is perfect for someone looking to walk/run/jog on a regular basis.  I've only used of twice but so far I love it. I'm waiting for the weather to warm up to take my son out for long runs.The only criticism that I have right now is that it doesn't stand up when folded down. Right now it's laying down in my garage but I would love for it to stand while folded.,4

Protective Belly Blanket by Belly Armor (Blue),I bought this product for my peace of mind. I mostly use the product as a barrier when my laptop is on my lap. We do not know the affects of Wi-Fi and ElecrtoMagnetic Fields on unborn children. I'd rather be safe than sorry.,4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My baby loves this teether. She likes to wave it around and play with it, she loves chewing on it and the squeaking noise it makes causes her to laugh out loud. Love this little toy. I will  be purchasing two more for each of my new nieces.",5

Madison Crib in White Finish,"Crib arrived about a week after we ordered it. My husband wasn't home to help me assemble it and I was impatient. I'm 7 months pregnant and it took me about 45 minutes to do it solo. Hardest part was doing the mattress support part alone. Other than that super easy to put together. Looks great in the room. Doesn't look cheap at all, looks exactly like pictured. Excited to be able to put it to use!",5
Sunshine Kids Monterey Booster Car Seat - Monterey Red,My son absolutely loves this car/booster seat. Its comfortable for him to sit in it. The cup holders that retract in and out sometime holds not only his drinks but his toys or some snacks. When he falls asleep I don't have to worry about his head laying on his shoulders since the head rest is very supportive. The seat is very sturdy and secure so it doesn't move all over the place while I am driving. Only draw backs is the seat it really heavy and does take a lot of time to take it out if you had to move it to another car which I guess is good. And the strap that latches to the metal in the seats is really short and difficult to stretch out. Its best if the seat doesn't have to be taken out a lot. But overall I rate it a 5 hands down. I purchased this seat 11/27/2009. My son started in this seat at 2 yrs & 2mo old and he is now almost 4 and he still cant fit in the seat so I wont have to purchase any other seats for him again. I like to give reviews after they stand a little test of time. I got a great deal for it but you have to look around for the best bargain.,5
KidCo Swivel Cabinet &amp; Drawer Lock,"If I had saved the cabinet latches that I removed when my kids grew out of the need for these, I never would have found these GREAT latches! I had already purchased another type of safety latch at a local store, but had not yet installed them because they seemed unnecessarily complicated. No big deal, but they had actual metal springs on the bendable prongs and it seemed to me that simple flexible plastic would do, like the ones I had taken down years ago. (I think I actually did save them, but do you think I can find them now?). Anyway, in the search for an alternative, I came across these and, wow! - am I glad I did. Once you re-install safety latches, you find all over again just how annoying it is to open a cabinet or drawer only to have it come to a sudden stop and you think - &#34;Oh, yeah. Those %#@* safety latches!&#34;  It takes weeks or months to re-learn the smooth opening action with the safety latch push integrated into the motion. But now we don't have to!  When the Grandkids (just one so far but we're keeping our fingers crossed) are coming over we &#34;turn on&#34; the latches and when they leave we just rotate them 90 degrees and can enjoy smooth, uninterrupted cabinet and drawer opening until their next visit. Life is bliss!",5
"Britax 2012 B-Agile Stroller, Red","Easy one handed compact fold. Comparable to baby jogger but a lot less cost. Folds to 10 inches thick.The fabric on this stroller stains easily.  It seemed to me to be tippy.  Our baby was uncomfortable in it. I have a bumbleride indie that I adore so maybe I wasn't comparing apples to apples.  Anyway, after 3 months I've sold it and bought a baby jogger city mini gt to replace it.  Loved the compact fold...hated the plastic like tires.",3

North States Supergate Top-Notch Gate,This is going back immediately.  I can barely move the sides back and forth.  After spending thirty minutes with this gate my wrist hurts from the strain. It wasn't locked.  The metal piece was free from the notches.  The one I have is simply extremely hard to slide wider or more narrow.  I have had several pressure gates over the years. I would have never dreamt that one could be so difficult to use.  I hate this gate.I bought it at a local store.  And it was much more expensive than the price on Amazon.  Whatever I buy to replace this one will most likely be from Amazon.,1

"Prince Lionheart 2 Stage Seatsaver, Black","Not sure what car is in the picture shown, but this cover doesn't come nearly to headrest in my Fusion. Other than that, the material is thick and this should prevent carseat from making indentions in leather like we were getting with the cheaper vinyl protector.",3
"Bumkins Reusable Sandwich and Snack Bag, Bright Blue, Large","I'm all for reusable containers. I have more bottles and lunch kits than I can count. But one thing I didn't give much consideration to is my use of ziploc bags. I put all this other stuff in reusable containers but little things like chips, cookies, granola, etc. I just put it in a ziploc bag. Well with this little bag I don't have to do that anymore.Yeah Dr. Seuss' Cat in the Hat is kind of childish but I really don't mind. It's a nice pattern and it stands out. While this bag is called a 'sandwich' bag I don't think it's wide or deep enough to be accommodating to average sandwich. You'll probably have to cut corners on your favorite slice of bread to make it fit just so. But that's not why I got this anyway. I've used it for cookies and chips n things and there's not anything bad about. It's just become part of daily routine to use this bag.The zipper slides easy but stays shut until you pull on it again. I don't see it being accidentally opened by jostling around in a bag or pocket. It's easy to clean too. Just flip it inside out and wipe it out.So I'm going to buy a few more of these and maybe I can finally ween myself off of disposable plastic bags. +1 for the environment!",5
Mommy's Helper Outlet Plugs 36 Pack,I needed about 3 packs to cover the house. I started with the nursery and then after my child got bigger I just lambasted the house with these for safety. Good buy. They fit tight and children will not be able to remove these,5
"Fisher-Price Musical Mobile, Rainforest Peek-a-Boo Leaves",What a cute mobile and I just love the Fisher-Price Rainforest decor. I was a little hesitant reading that it was only recommeded to use the mobile part of the crib till the baby is 5 months old we decided to go ahead and get it (our baby was 4 months at the time). Well Noah is now 8 months old and we are still using the entire mobile on this crib. He loves watching it and I love the different selections of music and nature sounds. Also I love the fact that once the baby is older and pulling up etc. that you can just remove the mobile section and use the musical base to help soothe. You can't go wrong. I wish we had found this when he was a newborn.,5

Evenflo Aura Select Travel System - Caroline,"I'm about to be a first-time mom, so I spent weeks and weeks researching different travel systems, reading reviews, etc.  The big selling point for this one was the one-handed steering and folding.  My boyfriend suffered an injury that rendered his left arm almost useless, so the one-handed operation is a big deal for us.  And this product far exceeded our expectations.  Assembly is a breeze.  It took me fifteen minutes, while 34 weeks pregnant, to put it together.  I love how sturdy it is!  And it looks amazing!I've come to the conclusion that this system was designed specifically for parents with a disability similar to my boyfriend's.  I've seen other travel systems in person, and was actually very concerned about how well he would be able to operate it on his own.  Most travel systems have multiple latches and require both hands to operate.  But my worries have been put to rest.  Everything can be done with one hand. It even has a handle in the center of the console specifically for one-handed steering.  I had my boyfriend test it out to make sure he could fold it, unfold it, and remove the car seat with one hand.  It's so much easier than we anticipated.  The only thing that absolutely requires two hands is adjusting the position of the handle on the car seat.  That, I can understand.  It's a safety issue, and leaving the handle up doesn't interfere with adjusting the umbrellas or anything, so it's not a big deal.  Another reviewer said she calls this product ""the Cadillac,"" and I can totally see why.  It just looks gorgeous!  I would definitely recommend this to any new parent, but it's an absolute MUST for parents with disabilities.  I have friends who have different brands of strollers, and you just can't beat the ease of operation with this one.It does have a couple of cons, although none of them are a big enough deal to affect the 5-star rating for me.  First of all, it is large and takes up a lot of space, even when folded.  It is also a bit heavy.  However, I have a PT Cruiser, and it fits in the back of my car just fine.  Even as heavy as it is, I can still lift it (I'm now 36 weeks pregnant) on my own to put it in and take it out of the car.  My boyfriend can also lift it with one hand, and although it's a bit harder to maneuver the heavy stroller into the car with one hand, it can be done without too much headache.  And I'd prefer something heavier and sturdier to something lighter and flimsier, anyway.  Also, I've noticed other reviewers talk about how it doesn't stand on its own when folded.  This is true, but a stand-alone feature wasn't on my list of priorities when buying a stroller, so I really couldn't care less whether it can stand on its own or whether we have to lay it down when folded.  Again, an absolute MUST if you or your partner have a disability.  But it's a gorgeous, sturdy, simple-to-use travel system for any parent.  This is by far the best buy for the money.***UPDATE***My daughter is now almost two and a half years old, and this product is still as amazing as it was when I took it out of the box.  She's now outgrown the baby carrier, and sits in the stroller ""like a big girl.""  Even now, I occasionally get comments on how nice it is.  A woman recently asked me if it was new, and was shocked when I told her I'd purchased it more than two years ago!  This is an excellent buy and will last for years and years.",5
"Major League Baseball Umbrella Stroller, New York Yankees",Great Stroller for Yankee fans.  Haven't seen anyone with it and I know fans love it.  Yankee fans or not I'm sure people wish they had a stroller to show their team pride.,5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","This rocker is amazing and a must have! We have used it in restaurants, wedding receptions, vacations, you name it's been there! It folds up nicely and is light weight. The baby is cradled so nicely in it and is very comfortable. We didn't use it as a bassinet but more of a napper and lounger. It's a great place to put the baby when you are cooking dinner, cleaning, or trying to get something done but also want them right there with you. Highly recommend.",5
NUK Freezer Tray,Great storage for baby food. Lid does not fit very tight so you have to transfer food into a ziploc once frozen. Very easy to remove food from tray though.,4
CherryCreek Decals Cherry Blossom &amp; Birds Decorative Nursery/Room Wall Sticker Decals,These wall stickers are so cute and I love the colors and the birds actually look like birds. At first I had trouble with them sticking to the wall but the next day I rubbed them again and haven't had any problems. Fast shipping. The instructions are easy to read and they number the pieces so you don't have to guess how they go up.,5
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,"We used a baby tub with a sling for our daughter from birth, and she grew out of it at seven months. So we bought this bath seat and it worked great until she was ten months. Then she wanted to climb out of it and stand up! There is no belt to strap the baby in and it is a very wide seat, so it is easy for a baby to climb out. Of course our baby is never unsupervised, but she is very strong willed and if she wants to stand, it is a difficult battle to get her to sit down. There really should be a safety belt of some sort.",3
"Kalencom Diaper Bag, Ripstop Orange","This diaper bag is just what my expanding family needed. It offers stylish versatility and a strength unmatched by other bags I considered. I love the magnetic snap closures because at best I have only one hand to secure the bag while carrying my son. The included matching bottle warmer, changing pad and wet bag all come in super handy too. I truly appreciate the ability to wear this cross body too so I'm not constantly wrestling to keep the strap on my shoulder. I highly recommend this bag to anyone considering it!",5

"Colgate Eco Classica III Dual firmness Eco-Friendlier Crib mattress, Organic Cotton Cover","I bought this as a montessori floor bed for my 5 month old- so far it is great.  I have it on the infant side and it is quite firm, which I like.  I guess my baby likes it too because the first night she slept through the night only getting up once for a feeding- usually she is up at least 2 times over the night. This mattress is firm enough for me to nurse her to sleep and then get up without disturbing her- so far I'm happy and no chemically smells right out of the packaging.",4
Safety 1st Kirby Inflatable Tub,"Pros: Soft and comfortable for babies to bathe in.Fairly roomy for bathtub toys.The loop on the back of the tub comes in very handy.  You can hang it on any hook inyour bathroom.  It dries well and doesn't take much space.Cons: The initial inflation was quite a work out, and I guess blowing air in by mouthis the only way.As with all inflatable products, the air does leak, but the leak in this one is veryinsignificant.  We only needed to replenish a little bit once in a month.The tub, when filled with water, is very slippery.  You just need to be very careful to secure your baby all the time.I think it is a great transitional tub for most babies eight months and older.",4
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,Has 8 recognizable tunes and easy enough for our 9 month old to figure out. Nice silicone-esque edging makes it easy to grip and keeps from sliding.,5
"Ju-Ju-Be Be Prepared Diaper Bag, Black/Silver",Definitely a must for long trips. It can literally hold a ton! Maybe too large to carry on an every day basis but perfect for airline trips or sleepovers. Can hold extra clothes and diapers for more than one child! Every momma needs one of these! I took mine on a two week trip to Mexico along with my BFF and spilled milk inside it. I washed it a day later and it came out like new! I was truly amazed. This is a bag for sure I will keep handy for years to come. Even thinking about taking it with me as my hospital bag for baby number 2!!,5

Jolly Jumper Pashmama Nursing Cover - Tan,"I really love the look of this product, and like that in the winter/fall I can wear it which will cut down on bulky things to carry around.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was that for me the neck opening is a bit large and it is a tad warm.  I have to be pretty careful about positioning otherwise it can slide down a bit low and if you are using a traditional nursing bra/pull down neck nursing top you can end up a bit exposed.  The fabric is great, but as with most nursing covers I feel like the kids get SO warm while feeding.  I would love it if they could make this product with a light gauzy fabric (as this is still fairly on trend right now!).  But overall I love how it is not as obvious as a nursing cover or blanket.  Plus it can be used as a scarf.  I would recommend for nursing mamas on the go! :)",4
TrueWomb Sleeping Swaddle - Blue - Preemie,"We tried muslin swaddling blankets, we tried sleep sacks with wings, we tried swaddle me blankets...and our little Houdini escaped them all, causing him to hit himself with his escaped hands and wake himself up...until we found this one...The design of this sleeping swaddle is different than anything else we tried.  The leg pouch holds nicely, but allows for stretching.  But what's really cool is the arm pockets...the way that they come over the baby's shoulder, and not just the arm, prevents escape, which means baby doesn't hit himself in the face with an escaped hand and baby sleeps more soundly (and let mom & dad sleep more soundly)...",5
"Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 8 Ounce, 3 Count","I had to feed my baby with formula apart from breastmilk. This bottle have the perfect size for her until now, that she is 4 months old. Easily to wash and doesn't leak.",5

Kidco Safeway white G2000,"The gate works well and it easy for a household with kids of all ages, as the older children are able to unlock and open the gate and close it behind them. I did buy the attachment for a bannister railing...works well. My husband did the install, not sure if I could have done it on my own. Just wish that the gate stayed wide open when you want it to....it doesn't, therefore you always have a gate in your way, whether you want it there or not.",4

"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","My husband and I were lent this by a friend when we had our son. This is a definate must for any parent (whether a new parent or not).  We loved this so much that when the time came to return it, I immediatly went online and ordered it. My son spent alot of time sleeping and just hanging out in this.  It is easily portable and is perfect if you have an event to go to and can't use something big like the pack and play.  We brought this to restuarants for family events and was perfect.  People kept commenting on how wonderful it was and had never seen anything like it. He was able to hang out in it  and take a nap while we ate.  This is also good for when yoru baby is teething as he/she is able to sleep and being somewhat elevated.  There's no concern about their spine being curved or anything.  As you can see from the picture the back is completely straight.  My son is nearly a year old now and is too big to sleep in it,  but I still let him hang out in it(strapped in of course) while he watches mickey or ice age while drinking his bottle or just vegging.",5

Blue Moon Muslin Crib Sheet - Organic Cotton,"I was a little nervous about how well this would fit the mattress because of the material, but this has a more secure, snug fit than half of our regular crib sheets!  It is absolutely perfect for warmer weather with the lighter, breathable material.  I've washed this several times now (even had to put it in the dryer once, which I usually don't do with crib sheets!) and it still fits very nicely on the mattress.  I'm very happy with this sheet, and will probably buy more.",5

Philips AVENT Microwave Steam Sterilizer,My family loves the Avent Microwave Sterilizer and I had to buy it for a family friend. It's great quality and lasts forever. I use it to not only sterilize bottles but any nicknicks that my kids use regularly.,4
"Dream On Me Double Twin Stroller, Pink",This was a good price for a double stroller however I used it for the first time on vacation this last week and one of the pull strings on the back already broke. Also it is hard to maneuver and definitely doesn't fit in tight spaces. The other thing I don't like is the umbrellas. They are very hard to get on and don't cover much. Overall is a good stroller but I don't expect it to last very long.,3
Kids Line Organic Willow Hamper,"The hamper is very cute and the colors are very accurate so it matches ou nursery perfectly!  I haven't used it yet, so I am not sure about durability.  The only downside to this item so far is that the fabric is easily wrinkled and did not come out fully when I ironed it (and it only recommends an iron on low).  Otherwise I think it is the perfect size and will go with our forest theme very nicely.",4
Delta 3-In-1 Activity Center Walker,"I RESEARCHED WALKERS AND ACTIVITY CENTERS FOR MONTHS BEFORE I FINALLY DECIDED ON THIS ONE!! IT IS THE BEST ON THE MARKET FOR THE PRICE, QUALITY AND AMAZING FEATURES!! THE PIANO PLAYS 3 DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF SONGS AND TUNES AND ALL THE BUTTONS ARE EASY TO PRESS AND KEEP OUR SON INTERESTED FOR QUITE A WHILE. WE PUT OUR SON IN IT AT 4 MONTHS AND HE LOVES IT!! YOU CAN RAISE AND LOWER IT DEPENDING ON HOW YOUNG YOUR BABY IS. WE HAVE IT AT THE LOWEST POINT NOW SO OUR SON BARELY TOUCHES THE FLOOR AND HE REALLY ENJOYS IT! WE EVEN PUT A SMALL PILLOW UNDER HIS FEET SO HE CAN TOUCH THE FLOOR AND ITS ALMOST LIKE A JUMPER FOR HIM. THIS 3-IN-1 CENTER IS PRICED VERY REASONABLE AND SAVES A LOT OF SPACE FROM HAVING TO PURCHASE 3 DIFFERENT PRODUCTS! YOUR BABY WILL GET GREAT USE OUT OF THIS AND KEEP THEM OCCUPIED LONG ENOUGH TO GET STUFF DONE AROUND THE HOUSE!!",5
Lulu Ladybug Rocker by Rockabye,"This product should be recalled.  My little girl is 2-1/2 years, and while riding this toy in a gentle fashion, she along with the rocker suddenly tipped over backwards and completely over.  She wasn't at all riding it hard as all this happened in front of me.  The fall was dramatic because the rocker is a solid 10-1/2 pounds and the flawed design results in the full weight of the toy landing atop your child in addition to his/her fall.  The nature of the fall results in the child's head impacting on the back side which has little protection.My little girl was wearing solid hair clips on the back of her head and the force of the tip-over shattered her hair clip into many pieces.  I can't imagine how much more damage this dangerous toy could have caused.This toy is so dangerous I won't even give it away as a hand-me-down.",1
The First Years Hands Free Gate,very good gate the only down fall is that it is only hands free gate if the mobile home or house or apartment is leveled other than that it is perfect and hand free and easy to install and it is alot harder to knock down than other baby gates my daughter could never knock this gate down no matter how hard she tried even when she was a year in a half she would stand on it and lean on it and it still wouldn't fall so it is all round a very good gate.,5
Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor with 5&quot; Screen,"The idea of this product is great.  We get so much static that it's almost impossible for us to even use this, I've been startled numerous times in the middle of the night.  It's so loud at night that we have to turn the volume down almost all the way, which totally defeats the purpose.  When there's a lot of static the picture is so distorted you can't see anything.  You can't leave the screen on at night because it lights up the entire room.  The picture isn't very clear, so it's hard to watch for detailed movement - like breathing.  I would not recommend this product.",2
The First Years Everywhere Gate,My little 7 month old girl was really getting around. I wanted to make sure I got a large steady gate that would work with both wall mounted and pressure mounted features. This gate is beautifully designed and the pressure mount is wonderful and doesn't move a bit! And it's so easy to open and close and installation takes only a couple minutes. Its incredibly steady and my lil one can't get her hands stuck in it. Perfect!,5

Nurseryworks Storytime Rocker in Slate with Dark Legs,"I ordered this chair off of an external website and received the product yesterday.Ease of putting together: (9 out of 10) It was extremely easy to put together.  It was a great idea to store the legs underneath the dust cover under the chair. Be sure to look there first if you find yourself without legs in the box. The chair is very sturdy and built well.  Very heavy so I would recommend that, if you are pregnant like me, you find someone else to do the heavy lifting as it is pretty heavy (my doctor's recommendation).  Of course, you may be different and able to help.Looks:  (9 out of 10) I love how it looks!  My husband, who is notoriously picky about EVERY.THING. loved the looks of it.  It is soft material, plenty wide, nice neutral color.  It will hide small stains with ease.  I do wish that it came with a pillow (like the Sleepytime rocker does) but it allows me to be creative and buy a coordinating pillow.Dimensions: (8 out of 10) The size of the rocker is fine.  The height of the chair back is lower than a typical chair.  You would have to slouch a little in order to rest your head.  The Sleepytime rocker has 6 more inches on this rocker so if this bothers you, you may need to order that rocker.  This didn't bother me because you aren't supposed to fall asleep while feeding a baby, which was my main purpose for this purchase.Overall, we are very pleased with our purchase.  I can't speak to its longevity because I only just got it.  I will try to provide an update in the future.",5
"Tadpoles 16 Piece Squared Playmat Set, Pink/Orange",Just like everyone else my baby took all the pieces apart.  It's so much work to get them back together every day that I just quit using them altogether.  I'm going to go out and get an area rug instead.,2
"Philips Avent BPA Free Classic Bottle to First Cup Trainer, 4+ Months, Clear","I have twins and I bought the Avent bottles. When my twins were newborn we went through 16 bottles a day. I HATE the ring that you put on the bottle supposedly to reduce fussiness and colic. The ring causes the bottle to leak. It is very frustrating at 200 AM to have a leaky bottle, it's messy and sticky.However, I do like the wide opening, it makes it easy to add formula. I would not recommend this product because it wastes formula and makes a mess.",2

Picci Dafne Toy Bag in Pink and White,"I would have given this iteam 5 stars as a rating in amazon but the fact is that, I could have paid less else where, after I found it in another store..... I should have looked closer, that goes for all the piccy dafne iteams (diaper stacker, toy bag, bed setting, canopy, pillows, etc..).If amazon is to be competitive, they should make sure their baby competition like baby r us and buy buy baby etc.. does not outdo them in price.Never the less, I bought it as i have Amazon prime membership and it is free shipping, but still... it does not equate me paying 10 dollars more :(So iteam is great I love it, amazon price is not :( booo",3
"Tadpoles 36 Sq Ft ABC Floor Mat, Pink/Brown",This product smelled so strongly of the chemical that they use to make foam that I was not comfortable having our baby play on it!,1
Medela Personal Fit XX Large Breastsheilds 36mm - Medela 87084,This is not as big as you think. Thank goodness they make this size! I pump all of my daughter's milk now and this makes it easier!! Less Pain,5
The First Years Take and Toss 28-Piece Feeding Variety Pack,"I really like these products and the price is great.  The forks are a bit thick and do not really work very well.  My son's teacher also says he can remove the lids off the sippy cup, but I have never seen this.",4
"Britax Advocate 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","This car seat was easy to install using the latch system and our daughter loves it compared to her first car seat. We have a mid size sedan and the car seat is in the middle of the back row. Down side to this seat is the size - any passengers sitting on either side of the car seat have a hard time buckling themselves, and have serious violation of their arm space. In all though, very happy with the purchase.",5
"Proudbody My Little Prints Baby-Safe Ink Pad, Blue",Ink pad was very dry. Prints came out light grey at best. I would recommend looking around for another item.,1
Safety 1st Advanced Solutions One Way Nasal Aspirator,"I purchased this for use on my 3 month old after the hospital bulb cracked. I am so surprised that this product has such low ratings. It works better than the hospital bulb and without making the baby scream. It only required 2-3 pumps in each side to clear her out completely. She is my 3rd baby and we have gone through dozens of aspirators and this is by far the best, inexpensive option there is.",5
Bumkins Waterproof Sleeved Bib - On-The-Go,"Long sleeve! Machine washable without wearing out! Pockets for catching food.  And unlike velcro bibs, my daughter doesn't mind having these tied around her neck. These are seriously the best bibs.",5
"Pura Kiki Pebble Silicone Bottle Sleeve, Grape, Tall",I really struggled to get these sleeves on our bottles and finally turned the task over to our babysitter. She went online and tracked down the solution that you need to make the sleeves slippery by using dish soap to get them on. There was no helpful information included with the product.Even using dish soap there are still hard to use.They do keep our kids hands from getting cold so they do what they say they do. They are also attractive and have texture to keep the bottles from slipping out of little hands.,3
"Jeep Liberty Renegade Walker, Storm",my daughter loves this product she's always running around in it I love it is well just that the side mirrors on the Walker are able to pop off easily beside that 1 thing is product is great,4
Animal Planet's Big Tub of Dinosaurs,Picture makes it look like the mat is very large and well made. In reality the mat is not printed even with the same pattern and is made of a very thin plastic almost like plastic wrap. The dinosaurs are not that detailed and light weight plastic as well. For the money I was not happy with my purchase.,2
"Kaloo Zig Music Rabbit, Blue",This bunny is so darn cute.  We got it for a girl even though it's blue because the bunny is so much cuter than the bear.  It's really high-quality manufacture and really lovely to use.  Plays a lullaby version of &#34;Hey Jude&#34;.  My niece loves to cuddle with it like a stuffed toy when it's not expended and playing music.,5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I looked in every local dept. store.. Checked out tons of different wraps here on Amazon and everyone had some reviews that left me lingering with doubt. After all, I'm carrying my daughter in it, I want to know its safe! I ordered the navy blue one for my wife and I and received it in about four days.The product is perfect! The fabric is soft as all get out while completely durable. It's in no way questionable as to stitching or anything. In fact there is no area a stitch can break. It's just one looooong strip. You can tie it as tight as you want. I'm 6'1&#34; and weigh 170lbs. My wife is 5'3&#34; and is 120lbs. Our daughter is 6weeks old and was born premie so is still itsy-bitsy; the medium one fits great for us! Totally worth it!Of course I hold her as often as I can with my arms and hugs... But it comes in hand when shopping or cleaning up the house... Especially when my son wants to play. :)",5
Baby Safe Disposable Feeder (Pack of One),"although i don't have this specific feeder, i do have one by Sassy. the whole idea is great, and my 7 month old son loves it. we also looped a pacifier keeper around the handle so that when we go out to eat we don't have to worry about it falling on the floor. i got the Sassy brand one at k-mart for $4, it has a few bonus features such as the inside part of the handle (not the part you hold, but the part that is on the inside of the bag) is filled with water that keeps the food chilled if you want. Also a big bonus is that it comes with a cover so that you can cap it and put any unused portions away for later, and the mesh bag won't touch anything. it also has a safety feature, like on pill bottles--that clicks so you know it is secure, and has 2 buttons to push on while turning that releases it. it's a great invention whichever one you buy, i highly recommend the Sassy brand.",5
"Woombie Convertible Baby Swaddler (Big Baby 14-19 lbs, Little Monster)","I agree with other reviewers that stated that the neck on this is too tight.  I ordered the Convertible Baby Swaddler in Big Baby for 14-19 pounds. My 4.5 month old is 25"""" and about 15 pounds.  There is no way I could zip this all the way up on him without fear of him choking.  I'm going to try a bigger size or one without a pattern because I read those are not quite as tight.  Such a bummer.",3
"Graco Stanton Convertible Crib, Classic Cherry","The crib was purchased from Amazon and was received in a timely manner.  The crib will be used occassionally for a visiting toddler.  It's attractive and seems to be very sturdy.  It was pretty simple to assemble...took maybe an hour.  Main reason for purchasing was the fact it also makes into a toddler bed, day bed or full size bed.",4
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","I could not find XLs anywhere!  my child has used these since he was a newborn, after swaddling ended - he sleeps well in these, and he does not get caught up in them, or knotted up.  We found our first one 2nd hand in a mothers club rummage sale and thought ""hey this would work!""  My son knows he cannot walk in it (18 months), and doesn't walk across the crib, though he can stand to complain about being in the crib.  I wish it had arms on the fuzzy ones, but we dress my child in a onesie and long sleeved pjs so he's warm enough - and we heat the room to 66 so he's really fine.Love this product.",5
Smart Mom Teething Bling Donut Shaped Pendant Necklace (Onyx),This was bought for a baby shower.  My daughter wears one for her baby and it is awesome.  Plus it's nice when the baby is using it that you can hold the other end and not worry about it falling on the floow.,5
"Gerber First Essential 6 Pack Silicone Nipples, Fast Flow",My daughter's twins are 2 weeks old. The girl had difficulty with standard nipples but did well with the newborn slow flow nipples from the hospital. So we purchased the Gerber First Essential. The holes were too large. Simple place some milk in the nipple and watch the steady drip of formula.,1
"NUK Infant Tooth and Gum Cleanser and Finger Toothbrush Set, 1.4 Ounce","I have not yet it. I hope it easy to use, appears to be a very good way, I hope you can fall in love with the baby teeth.",5
"Pura Stainless Kiki Sippy Bottle Stainless Steel, 11 Ounce, Natural","I love this stainless steel water bottle for my 2 year old.  One thing that I didn't see in the description was that it comes with a silicone cover for the sippy top, which is great for keeping it clean when throwing this into your bag.  I ordered the Avent sport lid, based on some other reviews, but found that the silicone sippy top it came with works just fine.  It has a nice fast flow and is easy to clean because there are no membranes or small crevices.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Polypropylene Bottle, Pink, 9 Ounce, 3 Pack",LOVE LOVE LOVE THE AVENT CLASSIC! I  was using the Breastflow bottles while nursing but when I stopped nursing my son decided he no longer liked those bottles.  So we tried these and he loves them!  and so does mommy!,5
"Baby Buddy Natural Bath Sponge, Natural",This sponge was really soft and lasted for at least six months before my 2 year old tore it apart. I bought a cheap one from world market and it fell apart the first day. I tried baby buddy natural bath sponge from amazon and it was not soft. I am ordering another one of these hoping that I get a soft one. I think they are all different so you never know what you're gonna get.,5

"Munchkin Sesame Street Toddler Fork and Spoon, Elmo",I wanted a distinctive set of toddler silverware to keep at my house. Other generic forks and spoons somehow made it home with my granddaughter. But Bert and Ernie are definitely identified with Grandma's house!,5
Rattle Boyo - Blue,"I still want to find a pink rabbit, but the blue one works ok for now!  Have daughter who cannot do without her rabbie.",5
"timi &amp; leslie Hannah 7-Piece Diaper Bag Set, Pewter",This bag is amazing!!!!  Really goodlooking and I love the pocket layout.  The stiching was loose on the front upon arrival so I sent it back in hopes that the next one is better. I really love this so much that I may just have my tailor see if she can fix it if it comes loose again.,4
Summer Infant Newborn-To-Toddler Bath Center &amp; Shower,"I was so excited to get this tub.  I thought the shower feature was such a plus.  I find it easy to add baby wash to the bath water, wash my baby, then rinse with fresh clean water from the shower.  The tub is a little short.  My daughter is very long and she already has to bunch up her little legs to fit (at only 8 wks old this was a problem).  But it still works.  Here is my big gripe...IT RUINED A SET OF BRAND NEW RECHARGABLE BATTERIES!!!!  The battery compartment is evidently not waterproof.  We installed the batteries and used it.  Then the next time I tried to use it and it didn't work.  My husband opened the compartment and found the batteries all corroded!  We took a picture and I am going to contact the company.  Based on one other review I think it might be a fight to get the cost of the tub and batteries reimbursed to me.  I am also going to try and contact a buyer or high up from BRU and let them know about the problem.  Upon opening the case we found that acid had leaked INTO the shower bucket - that is dangerous to our baby!  I can't imagine if she would have gotten some in her eyes or something!BUYER BEWARE!",1
Tommee Tippee Newborn Starter Set,I can't think of why this is so popular. I have Medela bottles as well and I like them much better.Cons:There is a lip that catches the last of the formula/breastmilk and makes it difficult to empty the bottle completely.The bottle is so big I can't see baby's face.It's awkward to hold.,1
Fisher-Price Disney Baby Nemo Squirt Teether,The sound this sound makes is fine but is way too quiet. I guess that can be a good thing but what's the point of having sound if the baby can't hear it.,2
Ladybug Parade Toddler Bedding 5 pc set by Sweet Jojo Designs,"Looks just as in the photo (note that the bedskirt is not included).  My 3 yr old. daugther loves her new bedding.  It's true it's not that thick, but it is definitely warm enough for us here in So. California.  I had to wash the whole set before use because it came with a chemical smell on it (perhaps from the plastic packaging).My only complaint is that I wish the sheets and the quilt were wider so that I could tuck them in better under the mattress on the sides.  They often come untucked in the middle of the night when my daughter moves around.  But I looked around a lot and it's hard to find such cute sets, and Pottery Barn is so much more expensive it's kind of ridiculous for something they will grow out of soon.  I think I would get them again, I may just need to look for different sheets that are wider.",4
"Pumpin' Pal 2 Pack Super Shields Angled Breast Pumping Flanges, Large","I have a Medela Pump In Style (purchased summer 2012).  Upon my first few uses, I was annoyed (and uncomfortable!) at how vertical I needed to sit in order to get the milk to flow into the bottle.Enter Pumpin' Pals.  I first bought the multi-pack.  The large size fit me best, so I bought a second set.  They allow me to sit comfortably in my bed, in a chair, at a desk, anywhere.  Especially for someone who is pumping several times a day at work, they were worth every penny!For sizing help, I am currently wearing a 38 D/E nursing bra, and the 24mm shields that came with the pump worked fine for me.  I think the sizing on the Pumpin' Pals has more to do with breast size than nipple size.  (The Medela breastshields are the opposite, as I understand it).",5
The First Years miPump Double Electric Breast Pump,Really practical because you pump in half the time. The bag is very handy. In case one pump is broken you have the second for spare. Easy to clean . Great price!,5
"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane","My son absolutely LOVES this car seat. He's hated car rides since he was born (I think it was just his infant seat) But when he uses this, He's quiet and just looks out the window and talks. He's so comfortable in it :)",5
EllaRoo Wrap Maija size M,"I like everything - good price, very thin and comfortable for me and baby. Cheaper than on some other sites. Nice colors too!",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Open-Top Cradle Swing,The thing I ordered this swing particularly for is that it seems to sit up more than the other infant swings. I found that my children could use it longer since as they get older they really like to look around and not miss out on anything. I also loved that it would swing in 2 different directions. Front to back & side to side.,5
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Percale Fitted Portable/Mini Crib Sheet, Pink Dots",Sheets were too small for the porta crb mattress.  The thread count was ok but could have been higher.  I do not like knit sheets so will put up with these.,2
"Combi Pod Bouncer, Lady Bug","My daughter is under 25 pounds and cannot sit up, yet this bouncer managed to flip forwards, pinning her to the ground. I do not reccomend this bouncer. It needs a 5 point harness. Very dangerious!",1
Delta Fun Time 36 X 36&quot; Play Yard,"It's colorful, durable and easy to clean!  It's a very good size for a little one.  Our daughter used this for play and occasional naps until she was too big and able to run around which for her was between 1 and 1 1/2 before she just got too big and mobile.  She loved the colors and the animals on it-had lots of fun!",5
"OXO Tot Bottle Drying Rack, Orange",The OXO bottle drying rack is great!  Provides enough storage for several bottles!  I also purchased the matching bottle brush!  Another great product from OXO!,5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","After having spent a considerable amount of $$$ on an avent bottle supply, I was leary to make the switch.  I am so happy that I did it.  Although the bottles are a bit pricey, it is so much better having the piece of mind that I am not causing my son any harm with a chemical-laden bottle.  And a friend of mine helped me save a lot of money by pointing out that the nipples from dr. browns and Avent bottles work perfectly well in the bornfree bottles so no need to spend extra cash if making the switch.  The only down-side to using the nonbornfree nipples is that the bottle caps dont fit snuggly so leaking can occur, but it has not been an issue for me, I just wait to make the bottle when I am going to give it to him, and use my finger to cover the nipple when I shake it.",5
"JOTO Premium Screen Protector Film for Barnes and Noble NOOK HD 7 inch Tablet, Anti Glare, Anti Fingerprint (Matte Finish) with Lifetime Replacement Warranty (3 Pack)",Product very hard to apply could not get the air bubbles out quality very poor,1

NUK Mash &amp; Serve Bowl,"Easy to use. Quality is good. My wife loves it. But sometimes, I prefer to have a nicer blender, which could be way more expensive.",5
"SwaddleDesigns Baby Burpies, Classic Polka Dots (Set of 2 in Sage)","I love these burp cloths.  So, very cute and holds up wonderfully in spite of many trips through the washing machine and many messy clean-ups.  I have given several as gifts and always a big hit!  Highly recommend.",5
Pink Turtle Safety Bathtub Bath Tub Thermometer Baby,"Item was cute, that's where the 1 star come from, however the screen was chipped and the battery was dead...don't waste you money unless you have amazon prime and want to try your luck.",1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"This is the second one of these seats that I've purchased. The other was for our second son.  It holds up well. My only &#34;beef&#34; with this booster seat is that the seat is textured so tiny food particles get caught in there.  Not the end of the world, you can clean it, it just looks a bit dirty.",4
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","Way more impressed with this baby carrier that originally thought. Our 10 lbs kiddo is still pretty small, but it has been great for neighborhood walks and around the house when he'd like to be held but I still need to be working at my desk. We've also got a great Bob stroller, but honestly I'd rather use the BABYBJORN carrier because of its size and lack of hassle.",5
"Baby Deedee Sleep Nest Baby Sleeping Bag, Dream Blue, Small (0-6 Months)","For the most part, I'm very pleased with this purchase.  My only complaint is that the colors bleed despite following the care instructions.  I purchased the color ""Cookies & Cream"".  Unfortunately, the ""Chocolate"" trim bled all over the ""Cream"" and now it just looks dirty all of the time.  Since it's used only at bedtime, I can put up with this annoyance.",4
"LA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32&quot;, White",I purchased this pad because I didn't want a changing table. We attached it to the top of a standard size dresser and it fit perfectly. I like the raised sides and the fact that it's waterproof. I purchased two very soft fleece covers made by Circo that work well with this pad and its safety straps. Great purchase!,5
"Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","This is a great carseat... comfy for my son and easy to use except for one feature... it is very difficult to adjust the tightness of the chest straps when the seat is installed facing backward. On another note, we love the fun pattern and my son loves the softness of the material.",4
Beaba Soft Bowl Set,"Everyone in my family laughed because they look like little doggie dishes, but at least they don't flip over.  Of course my baby's little nose isn't stuffed into the bowl.  It works well enough but does stain with certain foods.",3
Dapper Snappers Baby &amp; Toddler Belt (Boys 3 Pack with Clips),"These are so easy to use and work great!  No more having to choose between """"high waters"""" or safety pins for my son. Turns our regular pants into adjustable waist pants.",5
"Safety 1st Vantage High Back Booster Car Seat, Nitron","car seat is average. really wished that the arm rests flipped up like they do on the majority of other car seats to make it easier to get child in and out of the seat. also, the cup holders are so low and because of the fact the arm rests dont move, i just removed it because it was too hard for my son to get his bottles or juice cups.",3
"Graco SnugRide Click Connect 35 Car Seat, Tangerine",good quality,4
Munchkin 3 Count Stay Put Suction Bowl,"The suction cups on these bowls are no match for a toddler.  They fail to stick, which defeats the purpose of buying the product.  The bowls still work as unbreakable bowls, and the covers make them good for carrying food on trips if necessary, but if you're trying to thwart a little dumper, don't bother with these.",2
"BabySmart Cooshee Booster Seat Hybak with Travel Bag, Onyx","My daughter refused to sit in her other booster seat, but needed help reaching the table without standing on her knees.  I was afraid she would still hate it, but tried.  She didn't like the idea, but tried it once because it was pink - she loved it.  It's comfy on her legs and fills the whole chair (no more marks on the back of her legs after dinner from seats that didn't fit.) She also has back support. I love it because it's so easy to remove for other guests, and replace for her.  The surface cleans well - wish it cleaned as easily as hard plastic - but it's well-worth the trade-off.",5
Graco SnugRider Elite Stroller &amp; Car Seat Carrier,"This has been a back saver! It's so light yet durable. We bought this after I ended up having a c-section and couldn't lift the larger, heavier stroller. Now this is all we use and will continue to use until we change to a convertible car seat. It has even made multiple airlines trips as a gate checked item.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,We bought this for our daughter when she was 4 months old and it is the best thing we have gotten her so far.  She loves all the activities and always has a smile on her face while jumping in it.  The spinning sun is her favorite.  It was very easy to assemble and fits in our home well.  The product is very sturdy and I feel very comfortable having her in it.  We tried out others in the store and the rotating seat seemed as though it would be difficult for a child my daughter's age to turn.  This seat turns very easily without a lot of effort from her.  Overall this is a terrific product and tons of fun to have in the house for our daughter to use and it is great entertainment for us to watch her in it as well.,5
Imiss Party In The Tub Light For Children Bath Time,I saw it and my wife and i fell that it was amust for our son. He loves itevery time we give him a bath.,5
Nike Jordan Classic '23' Red and Black Infants or Baby Bodysuit Cap/ Hat Booties+ Free 3.5mm Anti Dust Plug- Iviva,I have to disagree with the reviews where this product is bashed. I have had a couple issues with it but Once I actually took the time to work with the product i was good to go. I bought this for my daughter right as she turned 4 months old. SHE LOVED IT from the very beginning. I was so happy. SHe loves to sit and play for awhile which is great because she is one that has to be constantly entertained. she is short so she does not reach the ground when she sits in it but i just put a blanket under her feet folded and she can touch that just find and jump a little to activate the music and lights. She loves to look up at the money other toy hanging from the arched bar above her head. It was simple to put together and i am more than happy with it at this point. The only issue i did have was that the seat kept coming off when i would pick her up out of it. Come to find out i am pretty sure that the fabric was caught causing the seat to not fit in all the way. After i took it apart put it back together and snapped the seat back in i have not had another issue. the base of this product has been redsigned so that it is no longer a full circle i saw the revised version at target but I find that the price i paid for mine was much better than the 90.00 for the updated base.,5
Jeep 2-in-1 Safety Harness,"As others have posted, arm holes are definitely big enough for child to get out of. When you adjust the straps enough, the back part is up by the child's head...I don't like that part of the design. I don't really understand exactly how to use this as just a wrist strap. We haven't used this much, but it was something we wanted to have in the event that we are in a somewhat crowded public area (assuming our 2 year old will not be so willing to always sit in a stroller). It gives him the freedom to walk, and us the comfort of knowing he's close. I would not advise this for any children who &#34;try&#34; to escape and run off. I would suggest a backpack style of the harness or a different brand. Our son is quite calm and tends to stay close. Price was good on this, but I guess that's because of the strange design.",3
"Lifefactory Silicone Nipples Stage 2, 2 Pack, Clear","I have used the Stage 1 version of these nipples. The Stage 1 nipples lasted me the entire 3 months without the need to replace them. I have already begun using the Stage 2 nipples and have been using them for 3 weeks. The quality is the same as the Stage 1's. I use the nipples for at least 8 feedings for each 24-hr period, which means I have used the Stage 2 nipples a minimum of 168 times already. Needless to say, the nipples are superb in quality, and these are the best in the market. If only the nipples were marked somewhere to indicate the stage. However, it is not big deal as I am able to distinguish the difference in the stages when I wash the nipples. The Stage 2's show a faster flow than the Stage 1's when I run water through them during the rinse process. Great product!",5
DaVinci Sleepwell Emily Two-Sided 260-Coil Crib Mattress with Border Wire,My daughter has slept on this mattress for 15 months. It fits our Davinci Emily crib great and we have not noticed any problems with sagging or tearing. She slept on the infant side until about a year old and now is on the toddler side. The mattress is a material that will easily wipe clean but we have a protector pad on it also. When changing the crib sheet I have no problem lifting it out of the crib myself and still can at 21 weeks pregnant.  I will be buying the same crib and mattress for #2 arriving this summer. I would recommend this mattress.,5
Monkeys Swinging on Vines Giant Peel &amp; Stick Nursery/Baby Wall Sticker Decal,"These are so adorable, I keep sneaking into my babies' room at night to peek at them. I seriously love them so much!My walls have a little bit of texture to them and the decals are sticking really well. After reading the other reviews, I actually bought some double-sided poster tape to help keep them on the walls but I ended up not needing it. I did go over each piece of flannel after putting them on the wall (I kind of rubbed the decals with the flannel to make sure they were stuck on the wall.)I think whether they stick really has to do with the kind of paint you have. Anyway, I love these little monkeys, and it is a really economical way to decorate a baby/kids room.",5
Jeep Deluxe Stroller Weather Shield,"I ordered this product a few times because I keep one in the basket of each of my strollers.It looks and works just fine. The Delux version basically covers your basket in the back so rain doesn't get in. The regular version is shorter in the back.This product is also supposed to come with a nice black cover for the rain cover. This product also comes in a green and brown cardboard box.Last time I purchased this from The Baby's Gallerie through Amazon, I got only the rain cover, not the black cover for the rain cover and wrapped in a plastic bag instead of the manufacturer's packaging. When I wanted a refund, The Baby's Gallerie says ""The packaging is what we like to call internet packaging. We find the fancy store packaging to add unnecessary costs. Not to mention it is less waste making it environmentally friendly as well."" They went on to tell me that this product does not come with the bag anymore.I'm sorry but when I buy something that is new, I assume that I also get the packaging. I want them to ask me if I want ""internet packaging"" as Amazon does, and IF I elect it, I want it to be packaged professionally, not in someone's kitchen ziplock bag. Of course, replacing cardboard with a plastic bag does not make it more green and that's how much credibility I give them when I consider their claim that it does not come with the black cover anymore.",1
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White","Tried to assemble the gate, but the extension insert was defective and couldn't even be added to the gate itself.  Very cheaply designed. The door handle was broken when delivered and would stick.  Returned this item right away!!!",1
"Bunnies By The Bay Blue Plush Bunny, Blue","Bunnies by the Bay plush are SOOOOO SOFT!  Baby loves it! This was a perfect Easter basket addition for our little boy who was 3 months at the time.  His Sister was given Itty Bit when she was born, so we have a few of these now.  Enjoy!",5
"Graco My Ride 65 LX Convertible Car Seat, Rane","Very sturdy seat. My 16 month old loves it. Half the time, he doesn't even want to get out of it. It is a little on the large side, but it's not a bad thing unless you have a coupe. There are two drink holders built in, and the seat is easy to get in and out of the car (I drive a 2006 2.5i). Also, there is one large seat belt style pull strap that adjusts snugness of the harness piece, so adjusting is a breeze. I actually didn't expect this kind of quality for the price.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"I recently purchased this playmat for my daughter.  I chose this particular mat because it had good reviews and the price was great.  My daughter is 3 months old and loves this playmat.  There are multiple sound levels and music options; lots of toys with various sounds, textures, and colors.  There are additional loops on the play mat that do not come with toys.  These were perfect for us to add links or other toys to.  Our daughter loves to watch the lights and grab the toys.  She coos and laughs while she is playing with this playmat.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a fun playmat that will keep their little one entertained and happy.",5
"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","I have a 2 month old with reflux and this bottle really works. I had a very hard time even breastfeeding her. I tried the avent bottle, because my one year old uses it and loves it. But the baby hated it , the minute she started sucking she would stop, choke on the milk in her mouth and start screaming and later spit up big time. She was gassy all the time and it was miserable. The first feeding with the ventaire I saw the difference. She started sucking and didn't stop until she was full, and didn't spit up later. What a relief. And for the bottle warmer issue, I just hold a burpy under the bottle until the excess water drips away, its so not an issue. Bottom line, love it love it love it!",5
"Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey",I loved this seat so much that I bought a second for grandmas house. But then it started to crack...after only halfhearted potty trained attempts and little use. Bought a different one that's not as soft but seems like it will hold up. Hoping the grandmas house one survives!,2
"The Happy Closet Baby Closet Dividers, Pink and White",These are really cute and excellent quality.  Not flimsy like some.  I like the assortment of labels that come with the dividers.,5
Sassy Wonder Wheel,"Bought for an 8 month old girl, she enjoys it everywhere. Its suction cup bottom allows this toy to go anywhere there is a flat non porous surface. Shipped on time and in great condition.",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","This bra has been a lifesaver because it allows me to type on my computer at work while pumping. I usually pump three times during the day and I didn't have to take breaks since I could keep working. This is the second bra I bought as the Velcro started to wear on the first one. But I used it very hard, 3 times a day for 8+ months. Definitely recommend for a hands free option.",5
Tadpoles Classic Gingham Fitted Sheets - Set/2 - Black,"I plan on washing the heck out of these before I use them,just to make them softer,I received two gingham check prints and they are cute to look at.",2
"Cardinal Gates Stairway Special Gate, Black","I first installed the gate and was going to give it 3 stars because it was difficult to open - the latch on the gate kept getting caught on release hinge/hole.  Turns out, the side that the gate hooks on to was installed upside down.  At first glance, it looks like both sides are identical, but if you look carefully, one side is thinner around the slot/hole which makes it release easily.  Having said that, it installs easily.  Here are some suggestions:1.  Recommended tools:  Electric screwdriver, stud finder ($10 or less on Amazon), and laser level2.  Make sure you pay attention to the parts and not make the same mistake I did by installing one part upside-down.3.  You HAVE to screw the gate on to a stud.  Even with the drywall plastic anchors, it will pull right out.  The entire weight of the gate will be resting only on one side.The nice thing about this gate:-  Perfect for crown moldings along the base-board, especially thick ones.-  Opens and closes easily and smoothly, with one had operation.-  Can be installed at an angle to accommodate where the stud is located.-  Paint and finish is great and feels extremely strong and sturdy.In conclusion, I highly recommend this gate.  It's pricey but for us, we really had no choice because of crown molding along the floor.  We returned some much cheaper ones but these are great and they actually look pretty decent.",5
Infantino Shop and Play,"I bought this for my daughter because it was the only one they had available at Target at the time, but I soon learned that I had wasted my money.  Like other reviewers said, it does not fit most shopping carts.  It also leaves the sides of the cart completely exposed, which unfortunately happen to be my daughter's favorite spot to put her hands.  My daughter did like the little toys, especially the ones that make sounds, but this product is completely worthless if you're looking to protect your little one from the filth and germs on shopping carts.  At this moment, I am here searching for a better cover.",1
Cosco Umbrella Stroller without Canopy,"My husband and I bought two of these recently because we have twins, but wanted to have lightweight strollers for our upcoming trip, we weren't able to take our double as it is too big to take into the airport and check at the gate.First of all, the strollers handles are way too short. I am about 5'4"" -5'5"" and I feel like I am slumped over trying to push it, plus you are standing so close that you hit the wheels or the back of the stroller often.Secondly, we didn't pay much for this stroller, but I expected it to be like other umbrella strollers I have seen. According to the description this stroller can sustain a weight of 40 lbs. But I don't see how. My girls are each about 16-17 lbs a piece. When you put one of them into the stroller the material pulls so much that it strains the stitching, if they weighed anymore it would probably break!Thirdly, it is very hard to fold up. With having twins we are always trying to rush in putting them in their car seats, getting the stroller(s) into the van and getting whatever we purchased in the van (usually because someone wants our parking spot). It is the type with a metal bar that you essentially just have to use your foot to pull it towards you to get it out of the groove then lift up. It is impossible to use your foot, and you have to lift the stroller up to do it by  hand.I am now in search of a different umbrella type stroller that we can buy two of, for our trip. If it was just for the airport, I wouldn't care too much. But we plan on using these during our trip, but I just can't see us trying to use them all slumped over.Save your money and buy something nicer that has better quality.",1
Safety 1st Sound 'n Lights Discovery Walker,"The Discovery Walker was just right for my 4 1/2 month old. I read the other reviews and noticed that most said their child was not able to reach the ground. My son is 28 inches, so keep this in mind when you buy. I think the toys were great.",4
Safety 1st On-the-Go Fold-Up Booster Seat,"I purchased this instead of a highchair for my 6 month old, we didn't really start to use it till he was 8 1/2 months old.We are limited on space for a highchair and I thought this would be nice and he can sit near the table.I do like it, easy to set up to use on a chair, easy to clean, the tray it large enough, and my little one likes it.Its nice that it can travel nice, but I use my floppy seat for travel. But I like that this can grow with my baby and I don't have to worry about the space the highchair would take up.Don't use the tiny storage in the back, so I just put the intructions in there for future use.",5
"Safety 1st Alpha Elite Convertible Car Seat, Dolce Latte","I found it for $89 at Sam's. Also, I have twins so this should count as two reviews! The boys sleep in it just fine thanks to the adjustable base and seem comfortable just riding around town in it when it's fully upright. Also, I love it because of the price. With twins, everything is twice as expensive and I have to keep an eye on cost. It had great safety ratings and was the right price. Cup holder is a huge bonus! It only lost one star because the shoulder strap adjustment (little cord up front that you release or pull to loosen or tighten the shoulder straps) seems to stick quite a bit when it comes time to loosen the shoulder straps. The wifey has a hard time with it. Takes some effort from me.",4
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Stainless Steel Straw Bottle, Pink/Purple, 10 Ounce","I was really happy with these straw cups until the straw started to disintegrate after only a couple months of gentle use! I expected more from these cups! However, customer service was nice and sent me replacement mouthpieces right away..",4

Graco 1 Second Ear Thermometer,"Our baby is due to arrive in Feb. I took my temp, it showed as 98.6. I took my husband's (he runs hot all the time) and his showed as 100.3. this product is so easy to use!",5
CNC-KE Taby Tray White,"I need to purchase a string to tie the sides to the back because this constantly slides forward ! It's so frustrating how their snacks took a nose dive to the floor. Good if you are not driving, but still has a tendency to slide.",2
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'N Play Sleeper, Pink Gingham and Giraffe",I bought this after dreading night time. My two week old will not sleep anywhere but on mommy. He hates back sleeping in his crib and bassinet. I read reviews for this item and it seemed like it could finally give us some rest. I bought it and he would have slept through the night if I let him! I actually had to wake him twice during the night to feed and change him. I will definitely be giving this as a gift to new moms with a baby on the way. I know too many babies like mine who hate back sleeping and this is an easy fix.,5
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,"I have been using the Avent bottle system for six months and have been completely satisfied. I introduced an Avent bottle to my daughter at four weeks old and she transitioned easily between breast and bottle. She is still breastfed in the morning and evenings but receives an Avent bottle at daycare and has never had a problem. I have never had a bottle leak of which other consumers have complained. I would recommend this system to any parent, especially those of part-time breastfed babies.",5
"Baby Delight Snuggle Nest, Green/White","the sounds quality is not the best, but the led light is helpfull, material are good quality, this articule is good size for a king bed specialiy if you have to share the bed.",4
Boppy Bare Naked Pillow,This a wonderful while feeding the baby or to prop them up while sitting on the floor. Have used it for two different grandkids and it still looks good and has held up great.,5
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","I bought one of these for our home as well as the in-law's house.  It covers the spout well and is not hard plastic like other covers.  You can also take the whale off nightly and hang it on a rod (by its tail) so it doesn't get yucky.***Updated March 2013- We built a new home and installed Moen T3693BN Voss Moentrol Tub/Shower Faucet into the kid's bathroom.  The spout on this one is longer, so the whale doesn't fit properly.  It still goes on, but water squirts in 3+ directions.  I'd still give it 5 stars because it still does its job.",5
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,Makes formula feeding sooo easy.  I mix a batch in the morning and it lasts all days - makes feeding fast and easy,5
"Stroller Hook - 2 Pack of Multi Purpose Hooks - Hanger for Baby Diaper Bags, Groceries, Clothing, Purse - Great Accessory for Mommy when Jogging, Walking or Shopping - Best 100% Money Back Guarantee",My wife uses these to hang some snack bags and her purse and they are easy to use. I'll order her a couple more since it's so convenient.,5
"Honeysuckle Breast Milk Storage Bags, 75 Ct (3 Boxes of 25 pcs)","I have tried several kinds of bags.The Medela bags are sturdy and you can pump directly into them, but they do not freeze flat, so they take up much more space.  Additionally, they are super expensive.The store brand bags (babies r us and target have the same bags) leak.  About half of the box leaked.  This is a deal breaker, since no one can afford to lose breast milk!  BUT they do freeze flat and they are very inexpensive.The Nuk brand bags are sturdy, seem to have an accurate measure, haven't leaked for me, and are reasonably priced. The only reason that I chose the honeysuckle bags was price.Oxo-honey suckle are wonderful.  They are sturdy, and freeze flat, the are really inexpensive and I haven't had any trouble with leaking.  It is hard to read the measure, but that is true of all of the bags.  Do you read them sealed with all of the air removed? No.  Do you read them with the top open? Closed? It's hard to say, so it does complicate labeling how much is in each bag. For that reason, I decided to stop pumping directly into the bags.  If you want to, Honeysuckle also makes bags that you can pump right into.",4
"Graco Duo Dinner Highchair, Brunswick","This is a sturdy highchair, i like the big tray. I like the fact that it folds, but be careful where you put it when in folded position as it may tilt and fall down on your kid. I would have liked to have a place to hand the tray on while folded.",4
"Kids Basics Contour Changing Pad Cover, Sage","Perfect fit for my changing pad. The color is a perfect soft green, even though the color in the picture looks a bit grey.",5
Annabel Karmel Masher and Bowl,"This masher has been perfect for making soft fruit purees like bananas either at home or on the go. The ridges on the inside are ingenius, the rubberized handle and bottom rim make for easy handling and tabletop use making mashing food fast and easy. LOVE this product! And the price!",5
Similac SimplySmart On The Go Powder Cap,"I use the Similac bottles and these caps are very helpful. However, like other reviews say, it squishes the nipple, the opening can be better designed, and it is a very large cap. Considering what is available, this is a great product. But I'm only giving it four stars because it is a little bit awkward, and I believe it can use some improvements.",4
"North States 3 in 1 Metal Superyard 2 Panel Extension, Taupe","Please see my review of the North States Superyard 3 in 1 Metal Gate. If your pooch is big enough (mine is about 80 pounds with his both rear legs injured) and needs room to stretch, buy this item. I have made a mistake and purchased the Superyard itself and this item separately. Being an Amazon Prime subscriber, I have not incurred any loss except for the time delay.",5
WubbaNub Giraffe,"As soon as I got pregnant, my mom started talking about getting my baby a WubbaNub.  I won't lie, I initially thought it was kind of stupid idea (with a really STUPID name).  Chalk this up to one more time that I'm glad I listened to my mom.  We love our ""Wub""!  The stuffed animal is very firmly attached to a ""Soothie"" silicone pacifier (the pacifier used by most hospitals). When my son we liked it because if he spit it out, it didn't go far, it was really easy to locate in the diaper bag, and it was really stinkin' cute. Now, as he gets a little older (two and a half months), he's started cuddling the little animal and grabbing it by the legs.  It's like his little friend.I think the ONLY drawback might be that now that he's putting the legs and ears in his mouth, it has to be washed more frequently.  Which is why we have TWO!  (We also have the little lamb, which is also super adorable.",5
Boppy Cradle In Comfort Bouncer - Blue,"Our son loves these!!  We have 2, one for downstairs (the blue model sold at BRU) and one for use in the bathroom (this one) while we are getting ready in AM.  This one seems larger and more round than the Boppy blue one but both are great.  This one is more papasan like. He has loved it since birth and is now almost 19# and 8.5 months old.  He loves to nap in it now.  We did have to remove the toy bar now as he likes to do pull-ups on it so not so safe now.  He loved playing with the toys when he was younger though.  The music and sounds are nice as is the vibration mode.  This has made shower time and nap time so much easier in our household!  Now if someone would only come up with one for older, heavier infants that would be great since weight limit is 25#.  Great Item.  I highly recommend the Boppy brand bouncers over other brands I have seen in use at friends houses.",5
"Chicco Ct0.6 Capri Lightweight Stroller, Red","I am 5' 6"" and my husband is 6' 2"" and this stroller is comfortable for both of us to push.  It has a five point harness for baby and the fabric breathes which is great if you are in the south during the summer.  We love our Graco Snug Ride carrier and frame but it was too hot to leave that baby in during our trip to Hilton Head Island.  This stroller works great, has a 5 point harness and canopy, doesn't take up my entire trunk and even has a small basket underneath.  If the basket were a little bigger I would give this 5 stars.",4
"Dena Happi Tree Hamper, Pink",This hamper really brings my baby's nursery together. A must-have addition to any Happi Tree themed nursery. I got this item at a discounted price because it came in an open box and it was in perfect condition.,5
"Pampers Airwave Venting System, Stage 3, 9 Ounces, Clear, 3 Pack","These bottles have been working for my son, but there is nothing special about them, you can get cheaper bottle that does the same thing (feed your baby). One major flaw is that the number was off real quick, we now have to estimate the ounces because there is no measurement on the bottle, they faded and eventually just was off(disappeared)after a few boiling for sterilisation.",3
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),"These  were literally on the slow boat from China; took a month to get here. They're cheap, but I didn't expect much for the price.",2
"Skip Hop Pronto Changer Diaper Bag, Black","The first kid you have this huge bag filled with everything. Then you have another and realize that this bag is all you really need. It can carry two diapers, wipes and a mat. Fits nicely in a backpack or bag of granola bars and water, & isn't girly.",5
Baby Einstein Baby Neptune Activity Center,"I had been shopping around for an activity centre when my son turned 5 months, I saw this one online and loved all the fish themed toys on it. It was easy to set up and my little guy just loves it! He loves the whale and the crab he is drooling and bitting those two all the time. The seat turns all the way around too so he can grab the hanging sea turtle. This is great if you need 20 minutes and have something you need to do. Highly recommended!",5
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,"These bags are good for freezer storage, as they are compact and hold enough for about two feedings for a newborn.  However, the little attachment clip for hooking to the breast-pump is clumsy, and allows for leaks.  We gave up trying to pump straight into the bags after a few attempts because of the leaks.Again, the bags for freezer storage are fine, but you won't save any time trying to pump right into these.  It's just too messy.",3
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,We just got this a few days ago but so far it's been great.  The music is relaxing and the swing is quiet.  I also think that the little guys on the mobile could be positioned better. Other than that my son seems comfortable in this swing and it usually calms him down and puts him to sleep when he is fussy.I did notice that the papasan swing sold at  walmart.com has an extra feature.. lights...Well so far I am very pleased with this swing.,4
"BOB Revolution SE Single Stroller, Navy","Talk about the Cadillac of strollers!!! I have had my Bob for more than six months now and it is amazing!!! Bumps, curbs, smooth surfaces you name it you problem! And if we have an unfortunate event such as a dirty diaper there is plenty of room without having to subject my princess to nasty restroom lol.  On top of that since my daughter loves to ride it helps encourage me to want to walk ;)!!!! I would recommend this stroller to anyone it is a amazing!!!!",5
"Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman, White/Beige","this glider is certainly at a great price and was very comfortable until my baby was about 5 months.  After that it seems she's too big, or the glider just doesnt grow with her/us.  I'd prefer something that I could put my legs up and recline a bit more since I'm in it so much too.Aside from the negative, it's a great color and certainly still worth the price you pay compared to dept. stores that can sell gliders for more than $1,000",4
"Trend Lab Fleece CribWrap Rail Covers for Crib Sides (Set of 2), Natural, Narrow","Wish I would have ordered these sooner!!! Very nice neutral color, extremely soft with a little cushioning so she doesn't hurt her head, and perfect for preventing damage to your crib.  This will definitely be on my list to give my friends when they have babies!",5
The First Years Disney/Pixar Cars Simple and Secure Booster,"I love this car booster seat.  We have bar stool chairs that are very high, so we have to lift my son up into his booster seat.  He loves to sit in his booster seat, and looks like a big boy in it.  The little design is pretty cute.  Overall, I'm very pleased with my purchase.",5
Mommy's Helper Slide-Lok Bi-Fold Door Lock,"We have metal doors and the top is not a solid flat piece as wooden ones would typically be. Because of this, these would not work correctly on them. While with the extender provided, we were able to fit this over them in a way that would allow it to stay in place, it was impossible to &#34;lock&#34; it because the hinge in the middle that it had to slide over was then too wide to accommodate it. Without the extender, the door simply opens with this thing in the middle like it isn't even there. Would have been great if this had been mentioned in the description. Hopefully, others in my situation will see this review.",1
Evenflo Big Kid Booster Car Seat - Mercury,"This is a really nice booster seat at a very affordable price! My son enjoys it and feels like a """"big boy"""" when he gets to ride in it. I really like the dual cup/snack holders. I like how the back comes off to turn into a backless booster. The arm rests flip up so you can move them out of the way if needed. I have no complaints!",5
Sealy Soybean Foam-Core Crib Mattress,"While I can't speak to this mattress compared to any others, I've had one for 2 years and just received a second for my baby on the way. It is firm without being hard. I definitely like the foam versions of kid mattresses. I did notice the latest mattress seems to fit much tighter than my original one, but this could be just from use. It fits in my pottery barn cribs very well, and leaves 0 gap. Another plus is that it isn't super heavy so changing sheets is easy. Overall, no negatives that I see.",5
Cradle Mattresses - Size 15x33,"My mom gave me an old cradle for my-soon-to-be bundle of joy, I couldn't find the correct mattress size anywhere. But I finally found this one, and it is a perfect fit! Very soft and comfortable (i tried it...lol!) I would recommend this mattress to anyone.",5
Mommy's Helper Cushie Traveler,"I purchased this potty seat for my 20 month old daughter. She only weighs 28 lbs and after 6 days using it the seat broke. We were at the doctors office and the hinge broke and the seat fell right in the toilet. Good thing i was standing in front of her or else she would have landed in the toilet as well. Its a good seat, just need better quality materials.",1
"Delta Night Stand, Cars","I was expecting an IKEA style Night Stand, a lot better in terms of quality and of assembling.My daughter loves it",5
Infantino Right Angle Tummy Triangle,"I must admit that I was skeptical of this product before receiving it. It seemed 1) slightly dangerous - I thought my two-month-old would topple over and fall onto the floor (as she easily topples over and rolls during tummy time on the floor); and 2) completely unnecessary - seems like one of those baby products that really is not needed and does not serve too great of a purpose.I was pleasantly surprised with this product! My baby can lie safely on the tummy triangle without toppling over. It helps her to practice lifting her head, and she actually seems pretty comfy while on the triangle. I like that when her little neck gets tired her head can rest comfortably on the triangle, instead of her face being smooshed on the floor. The mirror and toy are kind of fun, and I think she will enjoy looking in the mirror and reaching for the toy as she gets older.I do have to say that I could have done without the little music timer. It is completely unnecessary, as it is not even attached to the product or related at all. And the songs give me a headache. My three-year-old sure enjoys them, though...Overall, not a bad product! I think we will give it some good use, especially since the flooring in our home is all tile and I hate the thought of my baby lying on a hard floor.",4
Marvel Superhero Squad Window Panels,I purchased these panels for my son's superhero theme room and they are perfect.  It made the bedroom stand out.  I would recomend this product.,5
North States 3 in 1&nbsp; Wood Superyard 2 Panel Extension,The play yard is of excellent quality in both looks and utility. I was very impressed with the factory packaging. We use it with two extensions to circle our free standing wood stove. It looks good and is sturdy enough to keep our granddaughter away from the stove. It is easy to fold up and store when she is not here. The rubber cushions under each panel protect our laminate floor and help keep the play yard from sliding around. I purchased this after reviewing all of the feedback from other play yards. I am completely satisfied with this play yard.,5
"Lambs and Ivy Luv Bugs Window Valance, Plum","The soft suede: the brown cloth loops for the rodThe corduroy: The plumb, large portion of the valanceThe satin: The pink ribbon that lines between the corduroy and boaThe boa: The white cloth along the bottom (fuzzier in look and feel than the other materials and will probably be a dust magnet so be prepared)It's simple, nice, and matches the rest of the set perfectly. It took the boring blinds she had and made the room MUCH more interesting to look at.",5
Taggies Big Soft Blocks,"I'm an early childhood teacher/nana and know the benefits of block play for children.  It's sometimes hard to find blocks for the youngest of children.  Recently, I became a grandmother, and wanted to buy my grandson his first set of blocks.  (I also bought him his first doll.) I looked at many blocks and chose these. This set of soft blocks is absolutely wonderful. They are bright, soft, easy to handle and visually appealing.  I would recommend these for any baby.",5
"Woombie Convertible Baby Swaddler (Big Baby 14-19 lbs, Little Monster)","My son is almost 5 mos old, weighs almost 19lbs and is 27 inches. He's a big boy, and this is fine. Yes, you do have to unzip around the neck, but that is fine. I just tucked the little tab in. The great thing is, you can wear this without a onesie and he stays warm, but not too warm. I kept his arms out. I really liked it.",4
Summer Infant Tub Time Bubble Maker,"I have two boys who are 3 and 6. My 3 year old was terrified of this toy because it is very noisy(similiar to a small handheld vacuum). Once he got past the sound of it, he enjoyed it a little. It does seem to go for a while without needing more bubble solution. For what it is, there are better alternatives available.",2
The First Years Hands Free Gate,We use this gate with one extension and it works perfect for keeping my very large 1 yr old (~30 lbs) out of the kitchen while cooking.  Very sturdy and nearly impossible for him to open on his own. The pedal is a great design feature and allows us to move easily in and out while carrying things (garbage?).  No complaints after 3 months of use.,5
"MAM Learn to Brush Set, 6 Months, Colors May Vary",my daughter started using it since she was one. Now she is two and we brush her teeth every everning (and she use one to brush for herself),5
Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"These score an A with me for eco-friendliness, but a C for effectiveness. They tend to kind of leak--as in they get saturated and then my bra gets wet and then my shirt gets wet. It would be nice if they had some sort of more waterproof fabric on the outside to prevent that from happening. That being said, I'm not sure if there is a better fabric option.",3
"Membranes for Medela Breastpumps, 16pc Value Pack, Suitable for Lactina, Swing, Pump in Style Pumps, Part # 87088",These membranes work as advertised.  They fit my Medela products just fine and there are enough to share with a friend.,5
Summer Infant Baby's Quiet Sounds Video Monitor,"We received this monitor as a shower gift and I love having it for peace of mind.  When my daughter was a newborn I could take the monitor with me to any part of the house and see her.  Now it is in our room and we only turn it on if she wakes in the middle of the night but it is nice to know I can see that she is o.k..  With that being said, the sound is terrible so we don't use the volume since she is right down the hall anyway, the visual is actually pretty good on ours but it has a horrible bright light so we keep it turned slightly away so we can sleep.  We are expecting another baby and will probably buy another camera to watch different rooms.",4
One Size Fit All- Diaper Covers for Prefolds or Regular Inserts PUL - RED,"I would give five stars, but sometimes the bububibi doesn't quiiiiite contain a wet diaper and the cover itself becomes wet. They do cover the prefold well. Fit is very good.",4
"Munchkin Shampoo Rinser, Colors May Vary","bought this for my 8th month old, who hated rinsing his head all together. After using munchkin shampoo rinser, my little one has no issues what so ever, and it's a pleasure to use.",5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow",My mommy-to-be loved this gift! This is a reasonable price for this item. I think the baby will enjoy this piano gym,5
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'n Swing with AC Adapter, My Little Lamb","Swing technology has certainly changed a bit in the last few years.  I was skeptical when I first saw this design, but it really is amazing.  Our son loves this swing.  It is very smooth and quiet in its operation.  For those of you that recall the days of 4 D cell batteries in a swing, always dying at the wrong time, this plugs in!  That in and of itself is a great development.I do not think this will last as long as the ""old style"" swing.  I think the weight limit will come into play.  However, for now, it is incredibly popular in our house.You will not regret this purchase.",5
Baby Buddy: Baby's 1st Toothbrush,This is a perfect 1st toothbrush. My LO loves to chew on this and very soothing since he is teething too.,5
Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate,"Our boy is 10-months old. He loves to crawl. He'll be walking soon. It was time for a few gates in the house. My wife and I looked around and selected the Evenflow Crosstown pressure-mount gate as a start for his bedroom door.When we attempted to put it up, we found that it was too wide for the door. It's our fault for not measuring first, but keep the dimensions in mind if you purchase. Fortunately, it could be installed from the hall walls outside the door and that worked just as well. It was a real struggle to install the first time. All the controls are under the cloth and are very awkward to use. We had difficulty getting both the top and bottom rails installed with the same pressure. If the  top was tight, the bottom was loose and vice versa. Finally, it was installed and works rather well although it is rather awkward stepping over with the baby in our arms. It opens wide enough that we probably can install it several other places in the house and, as he grows, we'll probably do just that. Fortunately, no screws or anything like that are required. It's portable so we can take it with us when visiting other houses.I have mixed feelings about this gate. Right at the moment, I wouldn't buy a second one. However, it serves it's purpose and it was relatively inexpensive.Gary Peterson",3
Gift Mark Fire Engine Step Stool with Storage,"I bought this step stool for my 8 month old son who is now pulling himself up to stand, knowing he would need it later.  I was drawn to it because it is cute, it's taller than a lot of step stools, there is a hinge to prevent fingers from smashing, and it provides some storage space.Once we put it together, I wasn't nearly as happy with it as I had hoped.  The wood is sturdy, but the hinge inside was so stiff and strange that my husband and I were never able to figure out how to attach it.  The directions were far from detailed.  There was nothing except a picture saying to attach the hinge inside.  The lid drops down without the hinge attached and it will eventually lead to smashed fingers.Also, the hinges that hold the lid are positioned as such that they will not allow the lid to close.  It hangs open about an inch because the screws in the hinge prevent it from closing.  This could have been an easy fix if the company would have just put the item together to test it before mass producing.Since the paint is smooth and slick, I am a little worried about my son stepping on it when wearing pajamas or socks and then slipping on the step.  I'm going to return the product, but if I were going to keep it, I would probably have purchased some sort of tread to stick on the step.  Maybe some of those sticker ones that you can buy for the bottom of bathtubs.I have to say I'm quite disappointed in the design which seems lazy for an otherwise sturdy and cute step stool. I had high hopes and I liked the picture and color, but unfortunately the negatives outweigh the positives for me.",2
"DaVinci Parker 4 in 1 Crib with Toddler Rail, Pure White","My husband and I purchased this crib to have at our house. We are first time Grandparents and wanted a nice, safe place for our grandaughter to sleep when she comes to visit. I read all the reviews before purchasing and was fully aware that the crib was not white, which was perfect for us. The furniture in the room where the crib is set up is vanilla, so it matches exactly. We are completely satistifed with the sturdiness of the crib. We have not yet assembled the trundle drawer, as I am not sure I want to use it. I was very surprised that the toddler guardrail came included. I am sure that it was in the description when I ordered it, but didn't even read that far. I knew just looking at it that this was the crib for us. I will agree the directions were less than stellar, but I put it together myself in an hour or so, so it wasn't that bad.Overall, I love this crib and can't wait for my little grandaughter to be born any day now!",5
Eddie Bauer Belmont Duffle - Grey/Black,"Nice diaper bag, al those pockets are really helpful, I just wish there were more room in the inside. Otherwise, I love it.Update:My baby is now 13 months old. This diaper bag is still in excellent condition and I use it EVERYDAY! I changed my mind about the inside space, It is perfect and actually I always have extra space in there. I can fit a lot of things (even medium size toys) and it does not look bulky. I got this model cause I wanted something that my husband could carry too without complaining about a ""girly"" diaper bag. Well, he never ever has complain about this bag, we both can carry it around. I am so glad I choose this bag!",5

"Fisher-Price Ipad Apptivity Seat, Newborn-to-Toddler","As an early childhood and family education specialist and parent educator, I urge you to not buy this product for your baby! If I could write you a prescription for ADHD, attachment issues, delayed language, lack of self-regulation, sleep problems, and delayed development- this would be it. Even in small amounts, this screen time CHANGES an infant's brain development. You are better off letting the child fuss for a while.

Medela Pump in Style Advanced Double Breast Pump,"I have had many different breastpumps, but this one is the best! I use it 2-3 times a day when at work and nurse my baby when I am home.  I have the pump in style advance backpack version.  It works great and quickly. My only complaint is that it is heavier and a little noisier than I expected. The bag is very attractive and can be used as a day bag without the pump. I did consult with a lactation specialist and was told this is the preferred electric breast pump on the market. I would advise everyone to shop around for the best price, I bought my for $220 with no charge for tax, shipping or handling!",5
"JJ Cole Mode Diaper Tote Bag, Mixed Leaf","I had high hopes for this bag when I ordered it. It arrived yesterday, and I liked the overall look of the bag and the fact that it came with stroller straps. It was a little smaller than I was expecting, but even that would have been ok. I will be returning this bag because it has one major design flaw, and that is the fact that it does not zip completely across the top of the bag. When zipped, you end up with a hole on either side of the top of the bag where smaller items could easily fall out of the bag if it were to ever tip over (or get jostled/tossed around in the car).",2

PottyCover - Disposable toilet seat covers. (6 individually packaged seat covers in each bag.),"Having an aversion to public restrooms myself, I didn't know how I was going to ever go to a restaurant or travel when my daughter was potty training.  I first bought these on a recommendation and I'm so thankful I found them! My daughter is now 5 years old and we still use them because as those with small children know, kids are less than concerned with germs/dirt than you'd prefer and tend to touch everything, everywhere. These cover the sides so they can hold the sides with both hands and the front enough that their legs can grip the seat and not come in contact with the toilet itself. They have a water proof underside so nothing leaks through the paper, though I still wipe down the seat pretty well before I place the cover on it. Of course, I'm still repeating &#34;Do not touch anything in this bathroom!&#34; over and over while we're in there, but I don't feel like she needs to be hosed down with disinfectant after she's done. I wish they were flushable but I don't mind picking it up and carefully tossing it in the trash on our way out. They're a bit expensive but for people like me who cannot deal with germs, they're well worth the money!The seller is amazing. Pretty reasonable shipping time. I've only ordered them twice but each time there was a handwritten note on the packing list thanking me for the order. Super nice personal touch that makes me feel appreciated as a customer!",5

"Boppy Cottony Cute 2-Sided Slipcover, Polka Stripe Green",I purchased this replacement cover for a used boppy. The color is beautiful! Some other reviews said that they were disappointed with the fabric but it is very soft - softer than the cotton covers. But it is not velvet by any means :) I didn't expect it to be so I am very pleased with the softness of the fabric. I have yet to wash it so I will certainly report back if there are any issues. I have other covers that I've washed frequently and have had no problem so I don't expect this to be any different.,5
Graco UltraClear Analog Baby Monitor,"My annoyance isn't really over the product, since I haven't even opened it yet to try it out.  I'm annoyed because I was looking for an inexpensive second monitor but wanted one with a rechargeable battery.  After carefully reading the description and even going to the graco specific site it stated the power source was ac adaptor/rechargeable batteries...which I stupidly took to mean it had rechargeable batteries.  Received the unit today only to see that it requires 3AAA batteries.  So if you're looking for a monitor with rechargeable batteries then this is not it!",1

Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This product deserves a thousand stars! I can't even find words to describe my gratitude for it. If you have a difficult baby, you must get this swing! After half a day or night of consoling my baby, my back is too aching to keep holding her. I would feel desperate if it weren't for knowing that I can always put her in this swing and she will relax and go to sleep. It has saved our lives! Not all babies need so much consoling, but if your baby happens to be colicky, this swing will become your most precious possession. It is of very nice quality- well constructed and safe, with comfortable soft lining. And it works really well. I don't have a single complaint about it. Also, the sounds console baby if the swinging alone doesn't work. And if swinging side to side doesn't work, then often swinging front to back will relax baby. It's amazing. I can't imagine how anyone would survive colic without it.",5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Jacques the Peacock Take Along Toy,"My 4 month old loves her Jacques the Peacock.  I was plesantly surprised when it arrived that it was larger than I had expected, but yet still is the perfect size for my baby to pull into her mouth.  She loves the krinkly material in the wings, and all the different features.  I love that it keeps her occupied in the car oor laying on the floor for long periods of time.  This is my third baby, and the peacock is one of my favorite infant toys I have had for any of my children.",5

"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I discovered the Moby Wrap accidentally and am so happy I did.  I bought mine off of craigslist and LOVED it right away.  It was perfect for my son.  He was so comfortable and my back did not hurt.  I also own a baby bjorn and a hot sling, but the moby wrap is my favorite.  It is difficult to put it on the first few times, but becomes second nature after a while.  The comfort is totally worth the hassle of getting the thing on.  Especially tricky in a parking lot because the fabric will fall on the ground.  I got in the habit of putting it on before I left the house so I would be all ready.  If I was going to multiple stores I would just leave it on in the car.  Be warned you will get a lot of comments from people while you are wearing your baby around.  I've had people ask me if the baby was going to fall out, or if I was pregnant.  People are ignorant, what can I say?  I got a lot of comments at the beach and lake where I would wear my son all day.  (He was about 5 weeks at the start of the summer.)  I didn't have the one with SPF, but that is a great idea, because I would adjust the wrap to completely cover my son from head to toe, at times when he was asleep.  I would wear him into waste-deep water with no problem.  I miss those days.  I passed my Moby Wrap onto a friend today.  I helped her put it on and load her 1 month old into it.  She loved it, wore him for hours and said it was sooooo much better than the bjorn she has walked into my house wearing.  I have also purchased this wrap for 3 other friends for their newborns.  I am definitely a fan!!!",5
Comfort U Total Body Support Pillow (Full Size),"This is my second pregnancy using this pillow.  As other reviews suggest, the pillow is totally huge and a tight squeeze in anything smaller than a King (though I used it in a Queen with my first pregnancy, with minimal complaints from my husband).  There is no perfect pregnancy pillow out there, but this one comes close, in my opinion!  It supports you all the way around and is body-length.  It offers many options as far as getting comfortable, and no flipping the pillow in the middle of the night when you turn over.  The only thing you have to do is move one half of it aside to get out of bed, which is cumbersome but gets easier with practice.  I think having this pillow made for better sleep later in pregnancy when it is hard to come by, if anything because it decreased the amount of ""rearranging"" of pillows i had to do in the middle of the night.",5
"Pearhead Babyprints Memory Babybook, Pink","I've seen boring baby books but this tops all.  The book arrived with one of the screws that binds it together already falling out.  There are absolutely NO pictures, only pages to fill out.  I guess it would work if you are looking for SIMPLE.",1
lillebaby Nordic Carrier,"I used the Bjorn with my daughter for the first 3 months and couldn't wait for her to fit into an Ergo.  I tried the infant insert with the Ergo and it didn't work out at all (she wasn't happy, positioning weird, too hot).  The Bjorn isn't very comfy and you can't nurse in it.  The Ergo is just too big for the under 6 month crowd.  BUT... the Nordic is perfect!  Very comfortable for baby and mama right from the beginning because the seat adjusts for small babies (vs the Ergo which is very wide and the baby has to really spread their legs).  There is no need for an insert, you can nurse in it very easily, and you can wear the baby forward as well (you can't in the Ergo)!!  My little one needs to be facing out once in a while as she fusses if she is facing in too long.  I have a 3 year old to keep up with, so I think it is great that I can change positions to keep the baby happy as long as possible in the carrier. She sleeps facing in or out and is a very happy baby in this carrier.  She is in it for at least 4 hours a day and I have no pain.  It is very, very comfortable. It looks nice, and is very easy to put on (easier than the Lillebaby Everywear because the straps are padded like the Ergo, not adjustable).  Two criticisms: there is a sleep hood attachment, but it does not come with the carrier and is not for sale on Amazon, and there is no pocket on the carrier (although you can order a cell phone case for $15).",5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet  Blue Sky Jumperoo,"Got this for our 6m old bc she was getting tired of the playmat. Easy to put together, but like some of the other reviews said, one side doesnt rest on the ground completely.  My daughter loves it and today I got the entire house's carpets shampooed while she was perfectly content. Some reviews said that they need to have settings where it can be closer to the ground so they put books under so their child could touch fully, but in the directions/manual, it clearly says just their toes should touch the ground. I love it, theres lots of things to play w. and it 'rewards' them when they bounce by lighting up and playing music. So cute, Im glad I went w. this one after reading TONS of reviews for other exersaucers!  I def. would recommend",4

"Safety 1st Infant to Toddler Tub, Light Grey","If you have a baby boy, I'd highly suggest getting just about any other baby bath but this one. It's bad enough (for any baby) that this tub has NO non-slip surface to it whatsoever. They're supposed to make these things safe, but it's impossible in this tub to even try holding baby still with one hand while washing him with the other. He slides sideways on the incline. And on top of that, they had to go and put that horrid little ball thing that supposedly stops the baby from sliding down. Hard plastic ball right between my son's legs, yeah, that's sure to make bath time a breeze. My son was made so uncomfortable that he squirmed even more, and we gave up on this tub after about three tries. I get that it's cheap, so I wasn't expecting much when we got it, but this was beyond anything I imagined. It's a crappy hunk of plastic, not worth a dollar, let alone ten.",1

Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,"Although I haven't tried other warmers, I absolutely love this one.  I love that you don't have to pour water into it each time you use it. It is great because it remembers the time you set on it and always goes back to that. The times that it recommends for bottles aren't exactly accurate, once you play with it enough and figure out what time works best for you, you can go from there (for instance, 5oz bottles I set for 3:25 and it is the perfect temperature for our daughter.  The one recommended was too hot).  I highly recommend this product and have not had any issues with mildew as other reviews have noted.  I have been using it for 2 mos now.",5

"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","We purchased this gate because the play room that we have for our three year old isn't ""baby proof"" and after looking at multiple gates and play yards decided that the reviews on this one were the best for the price of the play yard. Some of the reviews are correct in the fact that this play yard doesn't look expensive, but I didn't expect it to. If I wanted something that was more expensive I would have paid more and got the gates that permanently anchored into the walls and built another baby safe play room.It is a heavy duty plastic construction, white and it has blue on part of the corners of the play yard. My 9 month old is no where near strong enough to move it, it's pretty heavy actually, but I could see how the type of floor you have it on might affect that, ours is on carpet in the corner of one room currently and works just fine. It has a small ""handle"" that is blue and has snaps to make it a little easier to transport. I will easily be able to put it in the back yard in the summer for my daughter to play in. If I were looking to make it more permanent in the yard I would use tent stakes or something similar and anchor if wherever I placed it only due to my yard configuration and I could put my 3 year old in it that way.We are purchasing the foam mat to put under it and taking one users suggestion to add the rings to clip toys on the gate itself. All in all I am pleased with the product. I would mention it is six panels so if you want to use it in more of a square shape I would suggest buying either a second one or the 2 panel extension which is what we are doing. Otherwise the square is actually a rectangle and it's not as large as it is in the octagon shape.PROS:- Inexpensive (ours was $48 w/ free s&h;)- Gives me the freedom to do chores without worrying.- Gives my daughter the freedom she craves in a environment I can easily move and baby proof.- Heavy material but light enough to move easily.- It's short enough I can reach over it without having to climb in (see CON below).CONS:- The color of the gate (if that bothers you, it is a ""cheaper"" looking heavy plastic)- If I had known the shape configuration I would have bought a second or the extension immediately.- No gate - So if you are short like I am if you needed to get in it would take a bit longer.Personally the color didn't bother me and we are satisfied. Since today is our first day of ownership I will update after we own it for awhile if there are issues.",4
"Graco Sweet Slumber Sound Machine, White","I have been using this in my daughter's room for a year now.  We do not use the mp3 aspect to it so I cannot comment on that, but the white noise is perfectly fine in both volume and sound quality.  At first I thought the night light was a little weak, but over the last year I have become used to it.  My only complaint is that the power cord tends to slip out of the plug easily if you even just pick it up slightly.  I just asked my MIL to buy one for her house for our visits, so I guess that means I am satisfied with it enough to buy another one.  I do wish the price was lower and would sacrifice the mp3 aspect to it for a lower price.",4

"North States Superyard 3 in 1 Metal Curve Gate, Bronze","I purchased this gate to be used to block the entire landing at the top of our staircase.  Since our landing is oddly shaped and a traditional safety gate would not fit under the stair's handrail, I was looking specifically for a multi-sectioned safety gate.  I read reviews for multiple products and had decided to purchase the North States 3-in-1 Metal Superyard when I discovered this product.  I was hesitant to purchase it since it had only a single review at the time (positive, fortunately!), but the look of this gate was far more attractive than the original Superyard and I decided to take a chance.  The gate is a dark taupe/grey color which has coordinated with our home's decor far better and I feel the curve makes it more decorative and less severe.  Functionally, it is exactly as I had read for the original Superyard.  The gate is designed with male and female adapters, and since we used an odd number of panels (3) to block the space we had to monkey with the panel adapters to get them to work.  This was relatively easy, and something that I had read about from Amazon reviews of the original superyard.  Using the provided wall mounts, we attached one side of the gate into the wall and the other end into a banister (using a separately purchased banister adapter).  Again, this gate is not directly at the top of a staircase, if you want to block a staircase directly I would not use this product as it did not specifically say it was safe to use at the top of stairs.  The door feature of the Superyard is easy enough for me to use one-handed, but difficult enough that my 4 year old cannot open it without assistance.  The doorway opening is somewhat narrow, but functional for our family.  I have recommended this gate to other friends with young children and I would purchase it again.",5

The size is great, even for tiny little hands.You only get one teether and the seller chooses which design, although you can choose the color.The teether with the Y shaped end is great for side or back teeth and the teether with the flat round piece is great for when front teeth are coming in. Both have a round ring silicone end as well that is great for any area, or to hold it.",5

Kawaii Baby Newborn Reusable Cloth Diaper Pure &amp; Natural 6 - 22 Lb. With 2 Microfiber Inserts &quot;Milk Time&quot;,These reusable diapers are fabulous for going green. They're soft and cute for a newborn baby. I'm sure they'll last for several babies.,5

Medela 150 Ml Storage Bottle Case of 10,Fits snugly with medela pump. Great for price,5
"Hands-Free Pumping Support for Nursing Mothers - Choose from 5 Fabulous Colors , Large, Verry Cherry","I was going back to work when my baby was 4 months old.  I had a job that aligned well with pumping throughout the day.  This seemed ideal for multi-tasking.  It was very comfortable, the pattern is adorable, held the bottles in place when pumping, but I just didn't use it often enough to justify the purchase.  It's also not like this is an item that can be resold as 'gently used'.  If you know you are going to try to have at least one more baby, this would be something nice to put away when you are done breast feeding and re-use with each child.",3
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","Awesome product!!! I absolutely love this to my baby. However,  I highly suggest also purchasing the extension piece that is sold separately.",5
"Belle Baby Carriers with Head Support, Black",I should have bought this when my daughter as an infant! Se loved it and it was very easy to use and convenient!,5
Wall Decor Removable Decal Sticker - Colorful Butterflies,Would not purchase again or recommend. The decals were thick almost plastic like and were coming off the wall as I was applying them! The would NOT stick! Literally stayed stuck for about 5 minutes then started peeling off.,2
The Door Guardian Childproofing Lock Colors: White,I needed this product to dog proof my house to keep my very smart pit bull from leaving the doors wide open. Super easy to install and works like a charm,5
Dream On Me 3&quot; Portable Crib Mattress,"I had a hard time finding a good mattress for a Canadian portable crib and the Dutch ones here in Holland are different sizes so for our trip to Canada to visit the grandparents I needed a good one that would last a few years. It was impossible to get one in Canada so I started searching the US. This one was good vaule for money and I had it shipped to an aunt in the US and she brought it to Canada for me (Amazon couldn't ship this item to Canada unfortunately). It fit well (slight space on each side where the soother ended up each night)and wasn't too soft or too hard. It's harder than our normal crib mattress at home but our 11 month old slept perfectly on it for 3 weeks of vacation and seemed right at home. The only thing I didn't like about it is that it doesn't fold up so transporting it in the car wasn't as easy as with our Dutch portbale mattress which folds in three parts and fits in a bag. But I would reccommend it if you have a portable crib which basically stays put most of the time, or a big trunk!Lori Duin-Mosher",4

"Munchkin Sesame Street Sports Bottle, 10 Ounce, Colors May Vary","I bought this for my 2 year old daughter who loves the poland spring sports bottle. This is not a sports cap, it is basically like bottle nipple. This item is unfournatly going back.",3
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","We picked this monitor due to the large screen size, night vision and ability to add another camera later if needed.  Our baby is 3 months now and we've used this monitor every day and are very pleased with it.  We mounted it near her crib and no matter where we put her to sleep, the remote controlled ability to pan and tilt ensure we can always see her face when she is sleeping.  There is volume control so we can turn it down in order to sleep through her tiny squeaks and only wake up when she cries.  Not sure if the music it plays is soothing or not - we haven't had to use it.  But overall very pleased with this monitor.",5
Lifefactory Glass Baby Bottles 4 Pack (4 oz. in Girl Colors),"If you're breastfeeding, don't use these bottles. Their nipples are very small and don't help train baby latching. They look cute but I had to stop using them very quickly. Wasted money.",3
"Britax Parkway SGL Belt-Positioning Booster Seat, Cub Pink",I love this booster seat. It was super easy to put into the car and it's easy to buckle. My daughter now normally buckles herself. I had a Frontier before and I really like the safety features of it. But it was heavy and bulky and difficult to buckle. The seat on the parkway is shorter than the Frontier but my daughter is able to easily fall asleep and she tells me it's comfortable. She loves the cup holders as they easily slide in and out (the Frontier ones were more difficult). I really like the side impact protection for the safety as well as it holds her head if she falls asleep. Putting it together was very easy.,5
"Kushies Waterproof Bib with Sleeves, Blue Circle, Infant","I bought several of these for my 2 year old twin granddaughters.  The bibs are lightweight and really help keep toddlers clean during meals.  Even though these are labeled hand wash, my daughter washes the bibs with cold water on delicate and dries them on air only or line dries them.  That seems to work perfectly with no harm to the bibs.  My granddaughters love the patterns, too.  I searched for long-sleeved bibs online and found these at Amazon.com.  These bibs are well-made and relatively inexpensive compared to other choices available.  We are all very pleased with this purchase and I have already bought more of them.",5
"Snuza Baby Monitor, Hero","This is what folks should be giving for baby shower gifts! I'm so glad it was recommended to me. I wouldn't let myself sleep for the first couple of nights after my son was born, because I couldn't tell if he was breathing. The snuza gave me peace of mind so I could rest.",5
"NUK/Gerber Seal N Go Disposible Liner, 50-Count",It was the cheapest offer of breast milk storage bags I found on Amazon but still it is perfect. If need be I will definitely buy it again.,5
Roach O Rama Cockroach Racing Crawlers,My Roach O Rama Cockroach Racing Crawlers look real.  The sticky roller underneath helps them move in a realistic way.  They fooled some of our friends to the point that they wanted to smash the roaches.,5
Rich Frog Baby Duck Natural Latex No Phthalates,"I bought this duck because it's made of natural rubber latex (from the Hevea tree)and I'm trying to avoid PVC and as well as other chemical laden plastics, especially where my children are concerned. This cute little duck is free of Nitrosamines (as well as BPA and Phthalates) and is painted with food-grade soy paints.The paint job is a bit sloppy on the duck that we received but they are each hand painted so that may not be the case on every duck. Our duck also has a very strong rubber (latex) smell, much more so than anything else that we have made of natural rubber (not sure why this would be).The squeaker on this ducky is very soft and ""airy"", not nearly as loud as the baby toys by Vulli, but my son seems to prefer this as the Vulli squeakers sometimes scare him. Due to the squeaker I would not recommend this be used as a bath toy, unless you want to replace it frequently, as water will get into this duck & cause mold growth.Rich Frog and Lanco would get 5 stars from me if only they offered versions of these ducks in a one piece design without squeakers for people who want to use these as bath toys but don't want to worry about mold growth in their child's toys. Overall, I like this duck & love that it is made of a natural material and not plastic like nearly all ducks on the market today.--- UPDATE 1/6/14 ---After several month of use this duck is still a big hit with my now 10 month old son. My son is quite the chewer and this duck has held up very well...which is more than I can say for some of the other toys he has gnawed on. The only wear noticeable from all the chomping and chewing is a small amount of paint that has worn off the points of the duck's feet. I would expect this to be the case with any painted toy and seeing the damage that my son's teeth have done to other toys I find the paint on this duck to be rather impressive. Since the paint used is both food-grade and soy-based I still feel that this duck is a safe choice to help alleviate my little one's need to chew.Also, the strong latex smell that I mentioned originally has faded significantly and is now hardly noticeable unless I put the duck directly up to my nose. I am still very happy with my purchase and still recommend.",4

"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","Looks great, very easy to set up and works perfect.  It fits into my decor very well.  It was great to find a gate that works so well and looks like part of the house.  It is nice not having to worry if you shut the gate each time.  Very easy to open (for adult) and shuts by itself.",5
Lamaze High-Contrast Panda Rattle,"This rattle is great. It's the first toy that my kid paid attention to and was very helpful in distracting and engaging the little one during tummy time early on. Now that he's a few months old, he likes to hold and chew on it. I don't love the bamboo, though. He especially likes to chew on those pieces, which I fear could be a bit of a potential hazard if he could get them loose. I'm tempted to just cut them off. Overall, it's a great toy, though! It's nice to have a rattle that's loud enough to get the kid's attention without being too loud.",4
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom",I have this item for only about 2 months and I dropped it only once.  It broke after I dropped it only once.  I do not recommend at all if you have toddlers or happen to be tired from being up with a newborn and are a little clumsier than usual.  I also called Motorola and they refused to fix it or give me a replacement unit even if I was going to pay for it.  Do not buy this!,1
Skip Hop Dash - Canvas-Chocolate,"I use this bag as a purse/diaper bag combo on all of my daily errands.  I carry several diapers, wipes, disposable changing pads a blanket, burp cloths a change of clothes, and a couple of small toys, plus my wallet, keys, phone and lip balm. If you like to have every single thing you might possibly need in your bag at all times, this is not for you.  If you are looking for something that doesn't scream ""diaper bag"" to carry the basics, this will be perfect!  Also, I attach the bag to my stroller all of the time and it is quick and easy and keeps all of your stuff accessible.",5

"Fantasy Furniture Homey VIP Sofa, Sweet Brown","I bought this couch for my 3 and 1 year old daughters.  My 1 year old can stretch across it and she fits fine, but is definately too small for my 3 year old.  She lies on it, but her feet and part of her legs hang off the end.I am glad I got the navy because they have already put their dirty hands on it and it wipes right off.  I have the matching chair too and it also small.  Very cute, but just not for an older toddler.",4
"Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","My husband and I bought 2, one for his car and one for mine. We LOVE everything about this seat! Our daughter seems to love it too. She instantly falls asleep as soon as we strap her in. It secures easily, fits in our Acura TL and Dodge Ram nicely. All of the safety ratings were what sold us on this car seat. I would definitely recommend!",5
"BOB Graco Infant Car Seat Adapter For Duallie Strollers, Black","This product was very disappointing. I bought it so that we could use it for twins, but this will only allow for one infant carseat. It was very misleading and I had to send it back.",1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Sea Turtle","I got this thinking it was better than the other cloud b nightlights for my nephew. When it arrived thought I would check it out. Was cute and nice that the various sea life light up, but they take away from having as many constellations on the ceiling and the other sea life don't project. Also you have the choice between blue or green lights don't have red and don't have blue/green it is Blue and green giving you two sets of constellations. With 2 moons and everything paired. Ended up getting the Red lady bug instead. It will arrive tomorrow will update with the comparison.So far don't waste your money on this one unless the above mentioned not a issue. Very cute little night light.",3
"Carters Super Soft Dot Changing Pad Cover, Chocolate","So there's really not a lot to say about this pad cover. It's very soft and seems to be well made. We've washed it a couple times now and it's holding up well.I guess the only thing I worry about is that it's a really nice cover for a place we're changing diapers. While we've only had one accident on it so far it does seem likely to get ruined pretty easily and quickly. Especially since our daughter loves to squirm while having her diaper changed and the pad belt doesn't really do the trick when it comes to holding her still. It just keeps her from sitting up.To top it off when we took the cover off to wash it she really didn't seem to notice the difference, which made me think that the cover is more of a novelty than a necessity.I will say that it is really soft and snuggly. If she notices the difference at all (or cares) then it is a nice cover.My wife did point out that without the cover when she did have her accident the changing pad is water resistant so it would've gone everywhere and run off the pad. But since the cover soaked it up... disaster averted.That said I think it was a pretty good buy but I think a regular cotton cover would've been just as effective.As I mentioned, it's a bit over the top but it is nice.UPDATESo it's been awhile since we got this and as I mentioned my biggest concern was it getting ruined.Well it's still in great condition. It's been drawn on with some markers and we've had some accidents, it's been washed more times than I can count and it is still soft and white.We use charlies soap which is pretty gentle on clothes to begin with so that may be part of it but I have to admit I'm pretty impressed with the cover.It's comfortable and durable. The same can be said for most all the Carters brand stuff we've bought for my daughter.",4
Philips AVENT BPA Free Microwave Steam Sterilizer,"Very practical - I can sterilize several bottles, milk containers and my breast pump at a time. Great value for money.",5
"Carters Easy Fit Jersey Crib Fitted Sheet, Pink",Love this sheet. We live in north Dakota and the nights get very cold. The jersey material doesn't get the cold wet feeling that lots of plain cotton sheets do. This sheet has deep pockets enough to fit any crib mattress with mattress pad. Launders well and no pilling. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is that out of package it does have a chemical smell but once I washed it twice the smell was gone so it's a minor inconvenience.,4
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"The extra bottles and nipples are great for storage. We ended up getting the cheap Gerber bottles with silicone nipples also, and they work just as well.  My 4 mo. old actually prefers the inexpensive nipples. I use both types of bottles for pumping with my Medela Double Select Breastpump. Save some money for diapers!",4
"Baby Einstein Rattle and Teethe, Caterpillar, Colors May Vary","I did not purchase this item, but received it from my sister after going through three of her kids! My little one still loves this even at close to seventeen months. It is a regular fixture to the car seat and highchair, even though it isn't used for teething anymore...it just is a favorite item still. My husband's co-worker saw us carting it around recently and commented that his kids had this same exact teether, and they loved it way past teething age as well. Don't know what makes it so compelling...but it has brought a lot of comfort!",5
Britax B-Nimble Mosquito Net,duradero y comodo. de un excelente tama&ntilde;o que sirve para varias medidas de envases. ligero y de un acabado mate bello.,5
Ohio State Buckeyes Premium Cotton Baby Bibs: 2 Pack,I have bought these because my husband is originally from Ohio and likes the team. I have bought this and a few other Ohio State items to give to him once I do finally become pregnant. They are very cute and I know that my husband will love it...now just to get pregnant. *sigh*,5
"Summer Infant Quickchange Portable Changing Pad, Black","In some of the photos this pad looks pretty wide but in reality, it is narrower than in the photos. The shape is more rectangular than in the photo. Not a big deal but I wanted to point it out.",3
26-Piece Foam Puzzle Play Mat - Solid Colored,These are the best I've found so far. No strange scents at all like other brands and no annoying letters that can be pulled out. So far they have been pretty durable. I bought 2 sets and plan on getting 3 more!,4
"ERGObaby Options Carrier Cover Set, Bold","When I purchased my carrier on ebay, it came with the bold pack - these are so much prettier :)",5
"Graco Highback TurboBooster Car Seat, Spitfire",My son loves it. Only thing is the arm rest sometimes make it hard to buckle seat belt. My son says it is very comfortable and he really likes it.,4
Safety 1st Simple Step Diaper Pail,"We bought this to use as a trash can in our babies' room when they were a year old and starting to get into everything.  I figured if it is marketed as a diaper pail it must be able to handle simply trash!  I was wrong.  The pail is so light and flimsy that it flips over as soon as you hit the pedal with your foot.  Nor does it close tightly.  My kids were into it immediately, and we put this trash can in the trash a few days later.",1
Cosco Scenera Convertible Car Seat Black,"Background: My husband and I purchased this to use as a spare car seat for our second vehicle (a truck, obviously not ideal for a car seat) and for traveling. We had used a Graco Snugride (Graco Passage Travel System - Lowery) and felt it was time to upgrade to a convertible seat in our vehicle as our son was big and finally had the core strength to sit up well while carried around with one arm. Our main car seat is a Britax Marathon 65 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx.The scoop: the LATCH system is a little tricky because they are attached to one thread. If you follow the instructions and make sure the thread isn't caught on anything or twisted - you should get a tight fit. We are using the seat in the rear-facing position, and you MUST MUST MUST have SEVERAL rolled-up towels or a small, rolled blanket for it to fit correctly. This caused the greatest headache. Because it sits out away from the seatback where it's installed, we found that even in large cars it had to be in the middle seat position. Enter no-LATCH zone in one of our relative's vehicles.We used the locking clip to install the seat in the middle part of the back seat in our grandparents' car. This compared to the birthing process in 'things I never want to do again anytime soon.'It's a lightweight seat, and we have used aSafeFit Car Seat Travel Totewith wheels for air travel, which is nice because you can store extra items in the case.Our son is not fussy in the seat, so I think people who complain about the lack of padding might just have whiny babies. I'm sure I have jinxed myself now, but nonetheless he has never appeared to be in any discomfort.Overall, the COSCO Scenera is a pain in the rear, but it eventually installs properly (especially with LATCH) and keeps my kid safe. And it makes me appreciate my Britax even more when we get home.",4
"Britax Roundabout 55 Convertible Car Seat, Isabella","We were driving 55 and a car ran a stop sign and pulled out in front of us from a side road. We hit the side of their car head-on.  Everyone in the car was badly bruised, with multiple hematomas, sprains/strains and the person sitting next to my son had a broken sternum from the seatbelt. My son has 2 little tiny scratches on his neck from the harness, and is otherwise uninjured. I am so thankful that I purchased this seat. In the ambulance on the way to the hospital, I couldn't stop thinking ""Thank God, thank God"" over and over in my mind.  It may or may not have saved his life, but it certainly saved him from much worse injuries.Also, I had purchased a new booster seat that was in the trunk of the car, as he has just reached the minimum height/weight to move up to a booster. I am so glad I did not switch him to the booster yet - I am positive he would have had much worse injuries in that booster. I am buying another britax 5-point harness and will keep him in there as long as possible.  Think about it parents - your child's safety is worth the minor hassle of a 5-point harness. You won't regret it until it is too late!!!",5
Boppy Tummy Play Pad - Garden Girl,Bought it because my baby hated tummy time. I wanted anything that'd help. This mat is nice & not expensive but we didn't use it much. A regular activity mat & a rolled blanket would've been just as good I think. The mat seemed a bit small when my daughter was 6 months old.It's a nicely made mat & mini boppy pillow but we didn't use it much. I probably wouldn't buy it again if I had the chance to do it again,5
"Bumkins Lunch Box, On The Go, Large",Very sturdy. Has removable dividers. Nice padding. The handle is great because it works great but isn't to bulky when you put it in your bag. Neither is the lunchbox itself. Would definitely recommend.,5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units,"Love the intercom functionality. Great quality sound with no static, which was a problem with other units. Extra receiver comes in handy. Charges while plugged in, so you can easily take outside with you or carry around the house on the battery. Perfect solution - we actually bought another for our house because these were so great.",5
Summer Infant Dr. Mom Nasal Aspirator,"This simply doesn't work. Well, didn't work for us. When it comes to items like this its all about personal preference.",1
"Skip Hop Studio Pronto Changing Station, Pewter Dot","This is one of my favorite baby items! It really does make any bag a diaper bag. I don't always want to lug my full diaper bag around, (like when visiting someone in their house or using my umbrella stroller) and I can just grab this and know I have a diaper change just in case. I also keep a disposable diaper pad in one of the pockets for those nasty public changing stations. Very useful on an airplane too!!",5
"Bumkins Dr. Seuss Clutch Bag, Cat Hat","I have been a big fan of Dr. Seuss since I can remember. Now that I have a child of my own, I was able to buy this and the matching diaper bag for a reasonable price. Very sturdy and many compliments!",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"Twice I found my baby sticking the legs in her mouth and into the back of her throat and choking/gagging.  She was not able or could not figure out to pull it back out (of course, she is a baby)  threw this product away!  If I was not watching her who knows what would have happened. Looked this up online and found this to be a common problem and I believe it had been removed from some stores",1
"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large","This is a great buy for the price!  Made of quality materials, rolls smoothly across the floors and looks super cool!  Definately a NICE toy for a youngster!!!",5
Dinomite 8 Piece Baby Crib Bedding Set by Cocalo,"I purchased this whole set of bedding, practically everthing pictured, for my first grandchild.  I haven't actually seen the items since I dont' live in Virginia.  However, my kids told me they love it, so I will give it 5 stars.  I just wish Amazon sold the wall decals.  I can't find them anywhere.  My son was a dinosaur fantatic as a child, so he is passing his love for dinosaurs on to his own baby.",5
Totally Toddler 1 Gallon Economy Refill,"I started using this for my boys' smelly socks (they were teenagers). When I found that it took out the foot odors, I started using it for all their clothes, bed clothes, everything. The odor of teen age male can be difficult to remove and they didn't like the flowery odor of softener. This stuff is amazing. The boys are grown and gone but I still use it to keep my laundry odor free.",5
"JJ Cole Feeding Bib, Cocoa Tree, 0-3 Years","These are definitely fantastic initially -- the snap at the neck, the pocket at the bottom, the pretty prints, etc. are all wonderful -- but they mildew so quickly that they're simply not worth the high cost. We certainly try to air dry the bibs properly, but it just doesn't matter. JJ Cole needs to engineer these to prevent mildew. Until then, I suggest not using them.",1
"Motorola MBP36 Remote Wireless Video Baby Monitor with 3.5-Inch Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan, Tilt, and Zoom","After trying to get by with a cheap monitor, this one is awesome.  No static or humming and the video is fairly decent.  The intercom function works well too.",5
Munchkin 'White Hot' Duck Bath Toy,"very good,though I havenot use it ,I don't know if my son will love it ,but i think he will",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","I really like this lunchbox. I got this for myself to take to work (don't have to be a kid to like owls). It's just as adorable as it is in the picture. My only complaints would be that it's smaller than I would like and that I wish it was machine washable. Other than that, it's cute and great for both kids and those young at heart!",4
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Pupsqueak Take Along Toy,"great toy!!! my daugther loved this toy since she was like 2 months and has not gotten tired of it since.  These toys are sooooo well made!  They say just spot wash but i have thrown it int he wash and dryer literally over 50 times and not only is it still in PERFECT condition, not a single seam has broken and the electronic barjing box in the doggie tummy still barks!!! So well made and so well loved....great toy!!!",5
Sassy Bathtime Kitchen Sink,"I bought this for my 2.5 yo daughter based on the reviews here, and we weren't disappointed.  It's a surprisingly fun toy, with a lot of creative, interactive possibilities.  (And gee whiz, no batteries, no flashing lights, no annoying beeping!)  My daughter got excited about it right away.  I've since bought another as a gift.",5
"Similac infant nipples &amp; rings, Standard Flow, Ready To Use, Case of 25","It is not clear in this listing that these ready to use nipples are single use only.  Honestly, for the cost, I don't think it's worth it if they are meant to be used once and thrown away!  I mean... my son eats 8 times a day!!!",3
Fisher-Price Zen Collection Cradle Swing,"I ordered the Fisher-Price Zen Cradle Swing as they had a different kind of cradle swing at my sons daycare and it wasn't available for purchase on Amazon.  The Zen collection is definitely more money than the other brands.  When the product came, it was missing the mobile and I have yet to see that from the company.  The swing itself does the trick and he sleeps well, but the problem is mom and dad don't sleep because it is so loud.  It is rediculous how loud this swing is at all times!!  I would definitley NOT recommend buying this type of swing if YOU want to sleep.",3
"OXO Tot Divided Plate, Orange","I like this plate because you can microwave it. Comes totally clean in the dishwasher. I wish it had a cover. I just have to use plastic wrap. The other small plate that OXO makes does come with a cover. I sure wish this one did. Oh, well. I still like this plate.",5

Medela 100% Cotton Washable Nursing Bra Pads,"These are a little to big for me (even thought I have big-uns).  They tend to get wrinkles in them and you can see them through a shirt, an under shirt, and a bra all at once.  Not my favorite.  They are, however very absorbant.",2

"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","Love these reusable bags, I don't put everything in them because some things are harder to clean out. I've used them for food, small items, make-up, etc. and never been disappointed. The fun patterns on the outside are great too!",5
Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature First Sips Weaning Cup - 4m - 5 Oz. (Pink),"We love this cup! It is my daughters favorite! We got it when she was 6 months old and she wasnt a big fan then but i pulled it back out at 9 months and it has been her favorite ever since!Pros:- spill proof!- no air bubbkes like her Dr. browns's sippy- soft but structured nipple- handles stay in place- durrable! This cup has taken many trips of being tossed over the side of the high chair!- ounces measurement on the side to track how much our little eater drinksCons:- stains easy! One of my daughters favorite meals is spaghetti. This quickly stained the beautiful, soft, grippy handles and spout orange- lots of pieces that need to be snapped in to be leak proof. A few times these have gotten loose and caused a little spill.",5
Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet in Rise and Shine,"I am from the age of playpens, so purchasing a Pack 'n Play was new to this Grandma.  However, my daughter and her husband used one in their home and toted it with them when they traveled to visit us.  To make it easier for them, I decided to purchase one for our home.  Directions were easy to follow in set-up and collapsing for storage. Does not take up much space at all when collapsed.  Granddaughter sleeps fine and it gives her the illusion of the baby bed which she is used to sleeping in at home. I would highly recommend this for any parent or grandparent.",5

"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Swaddle, Soft Pink, Newborn","best thing and my go-to when putting baby to bed. swaddles without restraining baby and perfect to use with warm pjs or t-shirt onsie. great, since my baby pulls blankets over her head and this is just warm enough.",5
myBaby Soundspa Lullaby Sound Machine and Projector,My new nephew abolutly loves this. so does my other nephew now we have to get him one too and probley for the rest of them too,5
"Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey","we were looking for a training seat that fit our elongated toilet.  this one is easy to use and our 2-year old can easily use it by himself.  we love that it's soft, comfortable and easy to clean.",5
"The First Years Spinning Drying Rack, White","This drying rack is essential for air drying all the baby items: bottles, bottle parts, pacifiers, toys, Nosefrida parts, etc. It is easy to put together, easy to clean, and it's great to have a rack dedicated to just baby items (rather than using the drying rack we use for dishes).",5
Chewbeads Necklace - Perry Necklace - Black,This necklace is great.  My daughter is super interested in it and started chewing on it within a few hours of wearing it.  This keeps her from pulling my hair as much while I'm holding her and that is awesome.  I also love that it's white and can go with anything.  It's a fairly chunky necklace and I think it's cute.  The only drawback is that is looks quite a bit like Wilma Flintstone's necklace... but I should have caught that before I ordered it in white :),5
"Graco Comfy Cove Swing, Ariel","The straps are very difficult to fasten when you have a child that either sleeps light or does not like to be jostled. If they made the straps a few inches longer this may not have been such a problem. We gave up after 5 weeks.  Amazon allowed us to return it for a full refund.Otherwise the swing worked as advertised. The assembly was not difficult, especially for anyone with experience assembling consumer products.  However, the directions were not the most clear so I can see where some might have problems. The battery life was good.  Our baby responded well to the white noise options like waves washing ashore but not so much to the music.  The mobile is kind if a waste a time as it is so high above the seat and so uninteresting our kid never even noticed it, even though he is very observant.We had used an older, similar Graco model when visiting others at Xmas but it had a tray, which seems to make a big difference. The kid really liked having the tray to place his hands on, play with the attached toys, and also provided some sense of being secure in the swing. He suffers from reflux and colic so the swing was like a miracle as he took many long naps in it and liked to be in it sometimes when awake.When using  Comfy Cove model with no tray it seemed as if the kid was going to tip out,especially when in the most upright position and he seemed less comfortable and more concerned about falling. He did not like being placed in it.  We could only attempt to use it when he was asleep and the poor strap system often resulted in him getting jostled enough to wake him up while trying to fasten him in. And then he would scream.We are now using a used Fischer Price Natures Touch cradle swing, given to us by a friend It has a much simpler to use and functional strap and also has a tray with attached toys.  He likes it, we like it, and life is good once again. Baby swings can be great, but getting the right one is important.",2
BABYBJORN Smart Potty - Red,"This little potty is perfect for small spaces. It doesn't take up much room at all. It's just the right size. Very easy to clean. Stable and won't tip over. I would recommend this for anyone. It might be a little short if your child is very tall, but otherwise perfect.",5
"Joovy Caboose Too Rear Seat, Greenie",This has turned out to be one of the best investments that I have ever made for my grandchildren. My son and daughter in law love it and it works exactly as advertised. It's a very attractive design and sturdy one also.,5
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",I would recommend this product.  I wouldn't give it 5 stars only because my hip pain isn't completely gone.  I will state that I've slept much better since I've gotten this pillow.  My hip pain has minimized quite substantially.  I love how you can go from one side to the other.It is quite large.  My husband says it takes up WAY more than half of our queen bed.  I don't agree.  I think it takes up a little more than half (he is just not used to being totally on his half).,4
"American Baby Company Organic Cotton Interlock Crib Sheet, Natural","These sheets are the perfect gift for the mom who wants only the best, healthiest products for her baby. They are exactly what I expected, great service, prompt delivery.",5
"Summer Infant SwaddleMe Adjustable Infant Wrap, 3-Pack, Mom &amp; Baby","My daughter kept getting out of her swaddles that I made with her Aiden and Anais blanket, and it was seriously interrupting her sleep (and ours) so we tried this blanket.  It is easy to use, and she has a much harder time getting out of it.  The only downside is that the velcro wears out.  Our daughter is still swaddled, and we've bought 2 sets of the 3-pack because the velcro stopped working on the first set.  But we loved them enough to buy them again.",4
"Evenflo 3 Pack Classic Glass Bottle, 4-Ounce","My baby still has a tiny tummy, so these small bottles work well for the amount of pumped milk he can drink at night. Sturdy bottles, bottle nipples work well too.",5
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx",My son lovesIt and can seeOut the window now! No trouble with transition at all! SuperComfy and cushy!,5
Munchkin 6-Pack Soft-Tip Infant Spoons with 5 Pack Multi Bowl Set,"I love the Munchkin brand and the bowls and spoons are what they should be. Disappointed in the complete difference in colors not just shades. The pic shows pink blue and purple - however what came was orange and yellow - I didn't expect it to be that different in colors, I really wanted the pinks and purples. Timing was great and arrived as stated.",3
Chicco Keyfit Caddy Stroller Frame,"What prevented me from giving it a 5 star is that it is squeaky, and something else minor. But it is super light, easy to assemble, and has much better space than the regular stroller. I don't like the shallowness of the cup holders though. My drinks keep falling out when I hit a bump or have to go down/up a steep curb .",4
Summer Infant 4-Sided Changing Pad,"This is a very soft, nicely angled pad that keeps your kiddo put. We have only started to use it, so I don't know how long it will hold up, but for the use, I can't imagine it wearing out any too soon. It's easy to place covers on and pull off. Definitely worth the buy.",5
Yookidoo Stack 'N' Spray Tub Fountain,"My daughter loves this.  She plays with it every night in the tub.  The variety of """"things"""" to do on it is great.  She especially loves when the water shoots straight up.",4
Evenflo Position and Lock Tall Wood Mount Gate,"Be warned, the product description says it expands from 26&#34; to 42&#34; but that is not true - the box it came in says 31&#34; to 50&#34;.  My doorway is 29&#34; wide and I had to force it in so much so that it is bowing the gate's frame.  Other than the size being wrong, it's a decent gate.  I'm am using it as a pet gate for cats and it seems pretty sturdy for that.",3
Mud Pie Little Princess Ceramic Piggy Bank,My granddaughter loved it! She loves ballerinas and wanted a big piggy bank for her birthday. I never expected to find both in the same piggy bank.,5
"Safefit Day And Night Musical Mirror, Black/Silver","I thought this would be absolutely perfect for my car; what a great idea! However, the music sounds awful and the light is all but worthless. Plus if I remember correctly it required SIX batteries between the mirror and the remote... ugh! I returned it the next day.",2
Playtex Sip Ease Replacement Valve - 2 Pk,The old straight line design pops off less. You will be popping it back in the holes constantly and so you will experience more spills if you don't check it each time you give the cup to your child.,1
"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear",I love them,5
Kids Line Willow Lamp Base and Shade,"An adorable and sturdy lamp that is colorful and heavy which makes me think it is well-made. Not in the least bit cheap or crappy as many other kids' lamps I've had. Also has an on and off switch which the child can control without pulling out the plug which was a plus. Very, very cute.",5
Car Seat Undermat,"On the day my daughter and I were discharged from the hospital, my mom and dad took my car to have the car seat installed.  They had been advised to go to the Police Station or the Fire Department to have this done.  The officer who had been called to install the car seat advised them against using the carseat undermat.  He stated it would cause the car seat to slide which of course would be unsafe.  I was hoping to protect my seat with the carseat undermat, but my daughter's safety is my priority.",1
"Bumbo Floor Seat and Play Tray Set, Lime","this seat was completely unaccepted by my 3 month old but now, at 4 months, he is somewhat enjoying it when there are toys on the tray - he has a bit chunkier legs so i think it's a bit uncomfortable for him. it's a solid little seat, but i only get about 10 minutes of entertainment from it until he's ready to move on - giving this 3 stars due to the price; these can be found at your local consignment or &#34;once upon a child&#34; store and look brand new (since they wipe up so well) - recommend trying that first before purchasing for $45+.",3
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"We took this stroller to Disney World and sea world and it was great! So  maneuverable, easy to use and lightweight. It even reclines! And the tall handles are great for my husband, and storage to put a cup, bags, etc.",5
"Blueberry Training Pants, Monkeys, Medium",Thick enough to contain some wetness if needed. Soft and cute! looks like real undies. My son is comfortable in them.,5
"Boppy Blissfully Soft Slipcover, Green","This slipcover is super soft and comfy, for sure worth the extra cost vs. the cotton/blend slipcovers which are scratchy and rough.  I feel good that baby's skin will be on something so nice and soft.  Highly recommend purchasing one of the soft boa's vs. the regular slipcovers.",5
Wimmer Ferguson Wimmer Infant Stim Mobile To Go,"This mobile is a lot flimsier than I expected and seems to be cheaply made. The designs and the color contrasts are appealing and will definitely capture a baby's attention, however I felt paranoid when I read to keep this out of baby's reach. Anything that I'm going to have in a stroller or car seat needs to be safe enough for my baby to touch. This mobile is great to look at but that's pretty much it.",3
"Hooter Hiders Hooter Hiders Nursing Cover, Huntington",It fits the need. My wife is using it everyday. We have tried other brand and they are very complicated to use. This one is simple and easily can be used.,5
"Dream On Me 112 Coil Spring Crib and Toddler Bed Mattress, Superior Slumber, 6&quot;",Awful mattress don't buy it,1
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L",I tried this product as soon as it arrived. It's comfortable and very easy to use! I would highly recommend this product to any and all moms that are nursing and are super busy. I wish I had this product with my first child! Its a must have for every nursing mommy!,5
"JJ Cole Collections Storage Box, Blue Stripe, 6.5&quot;",I ordered these boxes to use in the closet in the nursery. The color is well represented online. They are exactly the size as advertised. A little word of advice is leave about 1/4&#34; to 1/2&#34; when measuring and accounting for the size of the box.,4
"Born Free BPA-Free 9 oz. Drinking Cup, Purple","Disappointed, I used these with my middle child and never had any leaks.  I purchased them again but things have changed very leaky spouts!",3
"Planet Wise Nursing Cover, Art Deco",Great quality with a perfect design. Really like the pattern and the little storage bag that comes with it. Use every day.,5
Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib,"This is my second time around as a mom and I have to say I've tried a lot of bibs.  With my son we were using mostly terry cloth bibs, but that was creating a lot of laundry.  I don't really care if he stains the bibs, but once the terry cloth is a mess, it has to be washed.  I like the idea of wipeable bibs, but I found a lot of them to be very stiff and get kind of gunky even when I scrubbed them with hot water.  So I finally caved and bought some of the bumpkins super bibs and I love them.  I can wipe them clean if his messes are reasonable or throw them in the wash if his mess is over the top.  I like that the material is soft and playable and isn't chaffing his neck.  The pocket it is a plus as it catches some of his crumbs and mess, but lets be realistic it isn't going to catch everything.  The bibs washed very well, they don't bleed and I even threw them in the dryer and had no problems.  I will say that the bibs are really for older babies who are mostly eating table food.  If your child is still depending on a bottle or breast milk for their source of food than you may want to hold off.  Yes they are waterproof bibs, but if your child spits up or is doing the dribble of milk down his/her chin while drinking, then the bib probably isn't going to stop that mess, you'll need something with some absorbing qualities in it.  Babies R Us makes a similar bib to the super bib.  Their bibs are also very good, have 2 and I've been using them for several months now with no issues.  Only thing I like about the Bumpkins more is that the velcro is on the side, near my son's shoulder, instead of attaching together in the middle of the back.",5
"NUBY BPA FREE 2 Handle 8oz. Cup / Flip-It Straw Top, Boy Colors","I really wanted to like this cup.  I normally love NUBY products, and this one was super cute, and it didn't leak. HOWEVER, I noticed my child could not get anything out of the straw.  He normally has no problem drinking with a straw, so I tried it myself, and so did my husband.  We could barely suck the liquid through the straw. Again, the cup is very cute, and it does not leak, but is not effective at all for actual drinking. Also, the price here is very expensive compared to other reatilers.",1
"UPPAbaby 2013 G-lite Stroller, Denny Red","This is our first umbrella stroller.  At first we look at the G-lux.  But it was heavier.  We like the recline feature on the G-lux but we found out the recline was not that flexible.  Since we will be carrying this to places,  weight reduction is our priority.Turn out to be a good decision, because our baby was able to sleep in it without problem.  When a baby is tired, he/she will sleep regardless the stroller can recline or not.",4
Cybex Solution X Fix Booster Car Seat- Cinnamon,This is a very comfortable and safe car seat. I would buy it anytime again. The back is easily adjusted and the seat is big enough to be comfortable. I would recommend it over and over again. The only thing I don't like about the seat is that it is hard to take the covers off to get them washed.,4
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White","I own two of these gates. The 1st of the 2 is great. I haven't had any issues and it works perfectly.The 2nd of the 2 is only 3 weeks old and no longer works correctly. (Latch mechanism won't release, like others)..Amazon is great about sending me a new one to replace this.I have no issues about installing the 2nd gate and trusting it. I'd buy this again for sure.",4
Avent Isis Manual Breast Pump,"I love this pump, it's great!  But there one mistake the manufacture made is it leaks milk when you tip the pump to the side or just move it a little which sucks!  Where the bottle connects to the pump it leaks milk all the time.  I use to have to older version of the same pump and mine didn't do that because it wasn't on piece!",4
"Mother's Minder Breast Feeding Bracelet, UV Sensitive","Got this for my wife for our first baby. It looks way more stylish than many of the other ones that you see so she could use it in different situations. The metal seems nice and the slider is a bit stiff at first but breaks in nicely. Is a great way to remember when the little one has eaten last.My mom also is thinking about getting one too because she needs to take her pills on time and this could help her out as she still has some memory loss from chemo.The only reason that this isn't a 5-star review is the color changing ability this is supposed to have. It does turn colors in the light but needs direct sun to have any effect. Even then it mostly changes color but doesn't look all that great, and then the other side is still light. Not sure why they added this feature but it is a case that they did more than they needed and it ended up hurting in the long run.",4
"Fisher-Price Space Saver Swing and Seat, Discover'N Grow","i really don't understand why so many people say it does not recline..it defiantly does..it sits in an upright position, but you can lay it back completely for baby to sleep..maybe try reading the instructions..my niece has this swing..she loves it..=)",3
Peewees Disposable Multi-Use Pads - 36 Pack,This was the best purchase!!  These work great and have saved our changing pad from being stained!!!  They are just like the paper they put under your chin at the dentist office - and they work great!!!  We use each one a few times - unless it gets dirty on the first use - then just toss it.  Great to have in the diaper bag as well - don't feel so bad using the changers in the bathroom with these!!!,5
"Boon Grass Countertop Drying Rack, Green","I bought this for my brother and his wife and it proved very helpful to them with a new baby. My sis in law was doing a lot of pumping, so there were all kinds of bottles and accessories to wash and dry, and they don't have a dishwasher. The grass is great because you can put all different sizes and shapes of items on it to dry. Great product for a great price! BPA-free a plus, too!",5
"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large",I bought this as a Christmas present for my nephew and he loved it.  I bought the larger sized one thinking he could grow into it but it was the perfect size for him.  He rode it around all day on Christmas.  Good build quality.,5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Water Teether Duo,"These are great for the beginning stages of teething, they seem like they might cracked easy once a tooth erupts but i haven't tried. But my baby didn't care for these as much as ones with more bumps for massaging.",3
"Keekaroo Peanut Diaper Changer, Solid Cherry","By the time you buy a mattress pad and (at least) 3 fitted sheets to deal with the blowouts, you have spent close to the same as this changer. Save yourself a bunch of laundry, and get a comfy, bright changing surface into the bargain.The material is firm enough to keep baby from rolling away. It always feels a bit cold to my skin, but our kid never seems to mind it. She is happy to lie there and stare at her mobile overhead for ages.",5
Sassy Wonder Wheel,we received this item as a gift and have purchased another one to give away as a gift.  our little boy has loved it for the past several months.  we have it suctioned to his high chair and it keeps his attention and keeps him entertained between bites.,5
Beep Beep Musical Mobile with Cars,"This was a great addition to a grandson's nursery where the theme is cars....old Bugs, to be exact.  Navy was perfect for our theme too.",5
Evenflo 60 Count Simplyabsorbent Nursing Pad,"They are softer than reg Lansinoh but not as soft as the Ultra Soft.I can tell the back is the rougher side w/o any issue. I prefer no adhesive b/c some of my bras are smooth nylon and adhesives don't stick on them.I would flip the Lansinoh nursing pad onto itself when nursing since the pads still slide on smooth nylon bras. I usually ended up w/ the pad sticking to my sore nipple when I tried to get it flat again- very painful. These I can easily remove, place on the bed in the middle of the night when nursing, and put back in again b/c I don't change after only 2-3 hours of wearing them when they are also completely dry. They stay put in my nylon bras too. I wish they were a little softer like the ultra soft Laninoh.",4
Fisher Price Brilliant Basics Corn Popper with Chatter Telephone,Great toys --always have been. They are still loads of fun and promotes healthy activity--my grandaughter loves both toys. Her parents were so happy to receive them for her.,5
NoJo Alexis Garden 4 Piece Crib Set,"Colors are rich, quality is satisfying (I'm sure if I had paid $600+ it would have been softer, but...), shipment was fast, price was reasonable. I'm so happy, and I can't wait to get the nursery se up. I bought the matching valance and wall stickers, both equally beautiful!",5
Barn Yard - 6 Piece Set,"I have also put this bedding on my registry.  The different textures and colors are fun to use in a nursery. It has given me lots of decorating possibilities.As far as price is concerned, the jcpenney price mentioned in another review states that the bedding set only cost $129.99.  This set only includes the comforter, fitted sheet and bumper.  The set at babiesrus includes those three items plus the diaper stacker and valance.  Both of which you could purchase individually from jcpenney but if you add it all up the price is the same, with shipping it's even more.  Something to consider!!",5
Safety 1st 2 Pack Custom Fit All Purpose Strap,My 10 month old son can open the cabinets with these on. All he has to do is pull on the cabinets several times and the straps slide out of the catch. Not impressed.,2
"Britax Adapter Strap Kit, Black",I love the Britax adapter!!! It works well with my baby trend sit N stand stroller.The adapter keeps my little one very secure . I highly recommend. Also it's very easy to setup. I'm glad I didn't waste my money on a stroller adapter.,5
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"This cup is the ideal size for my nine-month-old breastfed baby who is just learning to drink water from a cup. He figured out how to use the straw immediately after having trouble with a traditional sippy cup. He can hold it easily himself. We've had no trouble with leaking, and not for lack of being held upside down and thrown around.",4
"Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep","Only thing I can say, is I wish the volume could be a little louder. My 2 mo. Old daughter loves the rainforest sounds!",4
KidCo GoPod Portable Activity Seat - Pistachio,"This works just as I expected. I can take it outside and put my son in it while I play with my daughter or work in the yard.My son is just 6 months and was off the charts at his 4 month appt (27.5 inches) but most of his length is in his torso, and this seat works fine for him now on the lowest level and I expect to use it for him until he doesn't need it anymore.It folds up nicely just like a folding camp chair and we take it with us when we bring our son to other people's houses.I clip some toys on the strap and he plays with them. I haven't tried any snacks or drinks in the holders yet, he's too young. Right now they slant downward to much when he's in it for me to think they would work. But I don't mind as that is not an important feature for me.",5
Princesses &amp; Pirates Go Potty Too Portable Potty - Pink,This is a good portable potty.  I don't really have anything to compare it to though.  My daughter likes the colors.  The only set back is that it didn't come with the bags.  You have to purchase those separately.  That info was not listed in the description.  Please update the product description.,4
Philips AVENT iQ24 Steam Sterilizer,"I thought I would be receiving the iQ24, but I received a large size plastic container type thing that goes in the microwave. It is pretty much like a big tupperware container that you put bottles in and then put in the microwave to sterilize.  The directions say to wash the bottles with soapy water before using this contraption...so really I'm not sure why I'd need it.  I don't have a dish washer so I guess it makes sure your bottles are sterlized properly, but if you use really hot water and give it a good wash then you wouldn't really need to go this extra step.  But if you don't have the time or really need the bottles to be extra safe/clean, then I suppose giving them a quick wash and popping them in this container for the microwave could be helpful.",2
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!",I have 3 sets of these blankets and adore them. My babies live them. This is my first pick for shower gifts. Other brands are not soft like A&A,5
QuickZip Crib Zipper Sheet - Ecru,"I was really excited about the idea of this product.  However, the fabric that is supposed to cover the zipper doesn't lay flat (especially after being washed and dried) and I was afraid it could present a smothering risk if the baby ended up with the flap over his mouth/nose.  Probably unlikely, but I decided not to use the sheets at all just in case.  The sheets also are pretty rough and wrinkly.",1
"Graco Pack 'n Play Playard with Cuddle Cove Rocking Seat, Winslet","Really a lovely piece. The print is so chic. I had no idea the whole pack n play was able to vibrate until I started putting it together. Changing table & side storage is super convenient & I believe that I will get a lot of use out of this with keeping it bedside. I put diapers, wipes & nursing essentials in side compartments. There's enough room in between the changer and bassinet to store a nursing pillow, swaddle blankets and burp cloths. I did remove the padding that was in the bassinet and replaced it with a more padded Carters Car Seat Cushion. When she gets bigger I will change them out again I just like the idea of the extra support for a newborn. I can not wait to use this baby!",5
Kinderwagon Hop Tandem Umbrella Stroller - Red v2,"I've had my fair share of double strollers and this is my go-to. It folds up very compact (only a little bigger than a standard umbrella stroller despite the fact that it's a double) and is not the size of a suburban when you're pushing it around town. My only complaints are that it's sometimes really, really hard to get it to open - I have to step very hard on the back to get it to open. Also, the back seat seems shallow for a seat that can go up to 40lbs. But I really don't think I'll need this that long, anyway. Overall I love this stroller. And it seems that these are very hard to come by now so I'm very glad I got it when I did!",5
Dream On Me Baby Trand Nursery Center Inner Spring Mattress with Square Corner,This mattress is 24&#34; wide not 25.5&#34;. It leaves a gap in my pack and play.  It is going back.,3
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"My daughter loves her new big-girl seat.  She just turned 2, and the chair works perfectly with our dining chairs.  We also took it on vacation with us, and it came in handy.  This seat is a great alternative to the pricey toddler chairs out there.  I highly recommend it.",5
Infant Bucket Seat Liner Color: Pink,"I needed something to keep my baby cooler during our car rides and errands in the Texas heat.  Despite just being in the heat for a minute or two during transfers from the car seat to stroller or shopping car, she previously got really sweaty.  Now, with the liner, she seems much cooler and thus, not as fussy.  A happy baby makes for a happy mommy!",5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"There has been enough accolades for this product and i agree with all of them, babies demand attention and this swing does a great job of calming our son down, he loves it.The downside is that it requires you to buy recharable batteries and a charger to keep it cost effective, batteries last 3-4 days on full charge with 5-6 hours of use per day, there is no electricity outlet.",4
Oxo-biodegradable Honeysuckle Baby Food Storage Bags (Baby Food Bag 300 Count),"This company has lightning fast shipping and fantastic customer service. I have been using the food storage bags and breastmilk storage bags for 10.5 months. They stand up well, have reinforced sides to help prevent leaking, and an easy pour top. Highly recommend.",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor,"Do not buy this product as it is really bad quality. We received ours recently and straight away it developed below issues which deem the product useless.1. One of the power supply doesn't work so we end up with one, as the baby unit require constant power ( not battery powered). It's almost impossible to use both with only one power supply2. Battery in the parent unit would only hold about 30 minutes. Since we only had one power supply now, it is such a hassle to constantly needing to charge the unit.3. Both baby and parents units turn itself on for no reason randomly. We do not want it on all the time, especially when the parent unit turns itself on and it produces annoying warning beep as the baby unit is not on.In summary, if you want a hassle-free baby monitor that can do the job and with decent battery life, STAY AWAY from this product.",1
Yo Gabba Gabba Nap Mat,My grandaughter loves it. Its so colorful and cozy. I would recommend anyone to buy this as they will love it!,5
Bumkins Waterproof Sleeved Bib - On-The-Go,So many plastic bibs cannot go in the dryer. Mine always do and they mess up. So I purchased Bumkins and they are do not over heat. There fantastic.,5
Disney Princess Potty Seat by The First Years baby gift idea,This is complete crap bought it without looking around for $12. It is terrible my daughter fell off because it is not sturdy at all they give 4 small padding sticks they dont help at all! Said fits most toilets nope. I wouldn't recommend this to any one.,1
Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 3 (Mint color mix),I used these same 3 snappies for a whole year and never had one break!  My mother who used cloth diapers on me and my brother was very impressed with how well they worked.  You never have to worry about stabbing a wiggly baby with a diaper pin again!!,5
Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing - New Nature's Touch,THE MUSIC STOPS! WHY?!?! my baby finally falls asleep and after 10 minutes the music stops and baby wakes:(. The cradle continues to rock but why does the music need to stop? there is no override for this. I would not buy this cradle again. I would look for one that plays its music continuously. everything else is great but with the music stopping it is worth very little to me,2
"Goodbyn Bynto Food Container, Red",I bought this because I needed a lunch box I could slide into a messenger bag.  This was a great size and shape for that.  It also really encouraged me to think of new things I could have for lunch.  I don't think this would work for liquids but I put pasta and sauce in there and had no problems.  I would suggest this to others.(also the top looks a bit like a cat so I had fun marking it up with a sharpie!),4
"Philips Avent Soothie Pacifier, 0-3 Months, Blue - 6 Pack",The hospital gave him these in the NICU. These are the only pacifiers he likes. The only ones I will buy.,5
Ocean Wonders Musical Aquarium Crib Attachment,"We had the first Ocean Aquarium by Fisher Price with our first child back in 2002, it was awesome and our son loved it.  We literaly wore it out completely beyond repair.  It was easy to put on the crib and even straped to his toddler bed later for a nightlight he could turn on hisself when he needed it.  When our next two girls were born they had come out with the square designed aquarium (2003,2004) and we bought it for the them.  We hated it, and so did everyone we knew.  It did nothing to keep their attention, we have ours and one that was given to us by someone else who didn't like it sitting in our closet, mostly unused.  With our fourth child we bought this one and it is better than the second but still not as good as the original.  It is bulky, harder to get on the crib and limits placement.  It is not as soothing cause the light is so bright, and the settings are not as friendly.  My baby does like to watch the fish go around and we do use it, but it still isn't as good as the original.  I would recommend this as okay, but if you could find the circle aquarium that came out in 2002 at a garage sell, you would be much happier.",3
"Aden by aden + anais Muslin Sleeping Bag, Oh Boy, Small","This sleep sack is perfect for those warmer spring and summer nights. We put a onesie on under if it's a little chilly, but now that warmer evenings have hit, our little girl sleeps in just this and a diaper.",5
"Dr. Brown's Natural Flow Wide Neck Storage Travel Caps Replacement, 2 Pack",Bought these to cap off my 5oz and 9oz Born Free glass bottles so that I can pump directly into the bottles and store them in the fridge.  Fits perfectly! Happy with purchase.,5
Wild West Western Horse Cowboy Baby Boy Bedding 9pc Crib Set by Sweet Jojo Designs,The product is great. It is what we wanted. However the shipping was terrible. I ended up paying an additional $12 and the product was over 2 weeks late. It was a gift and the nursery was designed around it.,4
Born Free BPA-Free Microwave Steriliser,"No problems with this item. I would recommend it to others. Easy to load. I have only used it with 5 oz bottles, so not sure how or if it will hold 9 oz Born Free bottles yet.",5
"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red",I love it! I had it on and baby in it within 5 minutes of receiving it from Amazon. It is long and it will drag but there are ways around this. I set the ends on my diaper bag while spinning myself to wrap it around. It may get a little warm but so does my other carrier that is made of less material. Baby still more comfortable in this one!,5
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,"With an overactive letdown, my lactation consultant recommended I get this.  It works great!  It is quite large, so not practical for use outside of the home.  Even though I'm 34C, I was able to use it no problem.  Easy to clean.  The storage case is quite large, and I would rather just have a smaller stand to place the milk-saver after a feed while I take care of the baby.",4
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","I used the bjorn A LOT before I knew there were better options. The bjorn is only comfortable for carrying babies under about 15lbs for short periods of time. I didn't feel like my baby was secure in this carrier. The bjorn is not comfortable or safe for babies as it puts the baby in an unnatural position by placing all of their weight on their spine. There are better options available (wraps, ring slings, becos, ergos, etc.) that are more comfortable and safe for baby.",1
Sesame Street Bath Tub Bumper - White,"As other reviews have stated, very cute but don't try to move it...the suction holds so well that it tore the bumper when we tried to readjust the placement.",3
"Newco Kids Race Car Bean Chair, Blue",We have a race car themed room and this chair was a great addition.  My son (age 4) loves it.,5
Munchkin A&amp;H Disposable Multi-Use Pad - 20 Pack,"We got the Boppy cover, and the liner was too small. So we ordered the Muchkin's pads. These work great.",5
Badger Basket Company Portable Bassinet 'N Cradle with Toybox Base - White Batiste,"Beautiful, but a little hard to assemble.",4
Acrylic Mirror Effect 3d Wall Decals Flower Shaped Mirrors Stickers Pack of 5 Set,Worst Quality.. the product i received has alot of sratches... looks like used.. i will not recommend anyone to spend money on this product.,1
"Extra Large 40&quot;x30&quot; Hooded Towel, Mommy &amp; Me Turtles, Frenchie Mini Couture","I bought 3 different towels from the same company (Frenchie Mini Couture): green with turtles,  blue one without any applications and blue one with monkeys. Unfortunately, after first wash towel with monkey came out without ribbon at the edge on two sides. Towel with turtles and blue towel without applications both look good after several wash. Not sure if I just had bad towel initially or that was damaged during wash, but now I need it to repair. Anyway towel with turtles looks better (color and quality).",4
Kate Aspen &quot;About To Hatch&quot; Stainless-Steel Egg Whisk in Showcase Gift Box,mom to be won this from winning the clothes pin game.  put it in a bag with pancake mix.  very cute.,5
Baby Smart Cooshie Booster Seat - Blue,"My 26-month-old daughter would only stay in her high chair for about 10 minutes then would beg to be taken down.  Our regular table chairs are too low and she wouldn't stay in them very long either.  The first time we tried this booster, she had a smile on her face from ear to ear. The table was at the proper height for comfortable eating and she sat through her whole meal! She has never done that! The booster is made of a special non-slip material and it really works. My daughter got spaghetti sauce on it and it wiped right off.  When I bought it I thought that the price was a little steep for a foam booster, but it is totally worth it! I highly recommend it!",5
Munchkin Auto Seat Protector,"I bought these for my new highlander, to protect the leather.  They are excellent, wide enough, but don't block the seat belt.  Keep all crumbs, play dough, etc. off of my new leather seats.  Plus protect from car seats!",5
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink","Fisher-Price never disappointed me as a Mom and doesn't disappoint me as a grandma. So, easy to attach to a chair. I love the wide tray.",4
Graco 4 Gallon Cool Mist Humidifier,"Does its job. Not as quiet as I would have liked, but I wouldn't say it's loud either. I use it in my bedroom at night and it doesn't keep me from falling asleep. I particularly like the LED display and its intuitive design.",4
"Aden by aden + anais 3 Pack Muslin Little Bib, Life's A Hoot","One thing I hate about most bibs is the velcro, so I love the snaps on these. Plus they are soft and adorable. Great for wearing during a bottle or for drooling (not heavy drooling).",4
"FunBites Shaped Food Cutter Set, Green/Pink","We have been using FunBites whenever possible to cut up our 2 year old's food. We've used it on sandwiches, fruit, waffles, and more. He really loves having his food cut up, and this is a quick and easy way to do it. It cuts down on meal prep time for parents, for sure. Our FunBites cutters have come clean with no problems when we toss them in the dishwasher.*I received a complementary product in exchange for my review. All opinions are 100% mine.",5
Jardine Dark Pine Glider with Beige Micro Fiber Fabric,"I love the way this looks and it was great at first. There was damage on the base but we called the 1-800 number and they sent a new one (however it took about 6 weeks so we ended up puting it together w/the scratched one). It is very attractive and sturdy enough, plus the microfiber is easy to clean for the inevitable milk spills - the reason I'm giving it a low rating is the seat cushion. It went flat where you sit within a month. I am not huge or anything - to give you an idea, I was using it w/a newborn and I am about 133 lbs. I have not called to get a replacement but even if they send one I'm sure it'll go flat again. Although I'm not using it quite as much now that my son is a little older.",2
NoJo Critter Babies Musical Mobile,Just what I needed for baby's crib and nursery.  Plays lullabys and is well made. Can make brown with included minkyFabric or it can be all white for a white crib,5
Leachco Back 'N Belly Chic - Taupe,"Not very useful for me. Too bulky and gets in the way especially if you need to constantly get up and pee. Wish I didnt buy it. My body ached more, head and arm support felt awkward and leg part seems to short. Two king size or even standard sized pillows put together in between my knees, a regular pillow for my head and a small one for my belly did the trick better than this pillow... Now its just an expensive bulky piece sitting around in the corner of the room. Might not have worked for me but Im sure it can work for others.",3
Kids' Sling Bookshelf with Storage Bins - Natural Natural,"Though the case feels solid, the 'veneer' is made of really cheap surface material.. thinner than a shelf liner. Since I was assembling this alone as a surprise, I used white artist tape to help hold it together until I got the dowels positioned in place. Upon removing the removable tape, it peeled off a good 1"" portion of the veneer.. now my son's new bookcase already has a defect. I decided the PITA of repacking and shipping back was not worth it and like so many others I decided to just keep it. Too bad we are forced to contend with and accept such shoddy craftsmanship. If you have any woodworking abilities at all, I suggest going to the library and getting free plans and DIY. Other than this caveat, it is just OK.",3
"Munchkin Two Snack Catchers, Colors May Vary",Our daughter started using this around 12 months and she loves them. She doesn't make a mess around the house but can roam and snack at the same time. They are life savers when we go out to dinner and she's hungry or bored before our food comes.,5
Disney Pooh Folding Bath Sling,Really happy with this product. Fits great in the tub and easy to clean! Its light weight and compact so I can take it with me when we travel!,4
North States Supergate Stairway Gate,"It's an alright gate.  It's really flimsy, but I purchased it based on price. So I suppose you get what you pay for. I was also surprised when it came that it had to be mounted to the doorway with screws.",3
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"This is a great product. I bought it almoast 2 years ago and it still works like new. No static, No extra noise. Just the baby. The voice activated feature works really great for us since my daughter sleeps with the fan running in her room. I just switch the monitor to the voice activated setting and i dont have to hear the constant noise of the fan. The monitor turns ON the second she make any sound.For all the users that complain about the beeping and out of range alarms - just be sure to read the instructions and set up the transmitter and the receiver to be on the same channel so as to avoid the beeping. This is very easy to do and the settings are color coded so as to avoid any confusion. There are just 2 improvements that i wish for in this product.1. Only one receiver - even though it has a rechargeable battery so i can carry it around with me, i would have still preferred to have at least 2 so i can have one in my bedroom all the time and the other one could be elsewhere in the house.2. The transmitter (the unit that stays in babies room) does not have any kind of battery so it must be plugged in at all times which could be an inconvenience if the baby sleeps in other places then her dedicated bedroom.But in summary, I recommend this monitor to everyone.",5
Trillion Dollar Non-Monetary Tribute Coin Features Statue of Liberty &amp; Eagle,This coin looks and felt great. Lot of person tell me they like to have it. But they will not pay the price.,4
Lansinoh Diaper Rash Ointment 3 oz (85 g),"at any sign of irritability, i put this product on my baby and within one diaper change the skin has been healed and redness is gone!",5
NUK Milk Bag Storage Rack,This is a really cool product! I keep it in my freezer and freeze the milk flat.... Sooo convenient! Would definitely recommend,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","I bought this for my 4 year old grandson, and this Christmas I bought it for a friend with a one year old grandson.  It's a great night light, and the older ones enjoy seeing the stars, like a constellation.",5
Kidco Y Spindle,Works with munchkin gates. We have this at the bottom of our stairs and I was able to secure our gate with the help of this item.,5
Nojo Sweet Jungle Babies 6 Piece Bedding Set,This is so cute.  I am so happy that I bought it.  I just wish I could find the lamp but I definitely would buy again,5
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Floating Activity Hippo,"My 1yr old enjoys this toy.  I would really have appreciated it if Fisher Price had put suction cups on the hippo to stick the unit to the wall, rather than the measly little fabric loop at the top of the toy's head...",4
"Kate Aspen Baby Bird Luggage Tag, Tweet Baby",Kate Aspen luggage tags are unique; I have purchased two. If I need more I will return to the site and order more. They are cuter than the expensive leather tags and so distinctive and the price is so affordable. The colors of the tags actually match my luggage. A plus!,5
Bonaco Caboose Travel Potty - The Diaper Potty,"This is great to keep in the car, especially for those times there is no bathroom nearby.  I was originally drawn to this because I have so many newborn diapers left over...so I was disappointed that the newborn diapers wouldn't fit.  The seat is small and my daughter had an adjustment period before she would use it willingly.  However....I would still recommend it and you can't beat the portability!",4
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","Totes perf. A little unstable even with the legs fully open, but not in an unsafe way. Just like a wobbly coffee table. Just need to get it adjusted just right sometimes.",5
"BreathableBaby Breathable Mesh Crib Liner, White","we put this on the crib today and it fits perfect. I couldn't do it by myself, it was very easy with two people. And I love the color its darker then the picture shows it matches perfect.",5
Bugaboo Frog Complete Stroller - Black,"My daughter is now 16 months old & this has been the only stroller we have needed.  Some friends of ours are on their third stroller, with a baby the same age.  So, the price is well worth it.  Everything is great about this stroller, just like everyone said.  But, I do have a couple major complaints.  There is no cup holder for the adult & no cup holder for the child.  With my daughter being older now, a snack tray would buy me some extra time.  I ended up buying an after market snack tray for my daugher, which works ok. I also bought the attachable diaper bag, cause else there's no where to put anything.  It is a great stroller & I would buy it again.",5
Prince Lionheart Ultimate Wipes Warmer,"If you don't want to startle your baby during the mid-night changings. .  . you need this warmer.Yes, you have to make sure you keep the moist pad at the bottom wet (or your wipes will dry out), but that's it.  Your wipes are warm and always ready to go.I have never had any browning and issues with my wipe warmer breaking or leaking water outside of the warmer.  I do recommend the pampers style wipes that pop-up, but they do make generic wipes that are cheaper than pampers pricing.",5
"Nuby BPA Free 4 Pack Fun Drinking Cups (Colors May Vary), 9 Ounce","The whole line of Fun Drinking Cups, Bowls & Plates come in assortment of bright fun colors and are the perfect size whether your child is just learning to eat by themselves or is an old pro like my 3 year old. They are extremely durable, and I love that they are ok to use in the microwave and top rack of the dishwasher.",5
"Kushies 2 Pack No Scratch Mittens, White","The size is good and the cotton is soft. But I found there is a log of fabric crumb from the cotton, when I took off it from my baby's hands.",1
"Lamaze Cloth Book, Panda's Pals",Besides being adorable this book makes noises and has plenty of flaps to move.  My 7 month old stay entertained while reading it and I don't have to worry about him ripping pages out.,5
Little Green Pouch - Reusable Food Pouch - 4pk,So excited to have these to fill myself! My kiddo is a huge fan as well!! Will be buying more soon,5
Lascal KiddyGuard Avant Gate - White,Used on my porch to keep my 19 month grandchild from the porch steps.Works like a charm! Perform a careful installation and all will be fine.,4
Clevamama Oven Door Lock,"We followed all the directions to clean th stove before attaching, but it just doesn't stick solidly.  The lock is hard to operate and each time I try very delicately to operate it, the thing starts to unstick.  At this point, my 12 month old could pull this off with ease if he just gets the angle right - and I have no doubt he will manage it within a few days, so I'm here to order something better.",1
"Gund Baby Huggybuddy,  Winky Lamb Pink, 17&quot;","Sweet little lamb, very soft and cuddly. I have gotten all 11 of my grand children a cuddly for their first Christmas. I get their name and birth date embroidered on them. I got two of these lambs and a giraffe this year. The embroidery looks great, even on the fluffy lamb skirt.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Portable Changer,"The previous model that I have looked high and low for is the same size but blue with a couple of fish on the front, however it had a hard plastic wipes case and a slot to keep the case instead of this flimsy plastic wipes case. Some people might prefer this as it is probably a bit more compact since it doesn't have the hard plastic case in it. Of course one could easily purchase a hard plastic wipes case and just place it in the changing pad and it would be almost as good. Wonder why they did away with the older design? Please see one of the customer images for what I am talking about.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"I bought this as a gift for my niece. The detachable toys are a hit--the monkey is her favorite toy and is taken with her everywhere. She seems to really like the music as well. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 because the mat is not as large as I would like (one roll and she us up against the bar), it does not fold up and store as easily as the Tiny Love mat that I had for my son and the mat is thin (but they all are so you need a blanket underneath if you don't have a carpet). I would recommend it to a friend even with those reservations.",4
Diaper Safari One Size Pocket Diaper - Cardinal,"I bought this mostly because it's affordable but I love the color. The PUL is not the best or worst I have seen, it's nothing to write home about and I have had a couple of leaks. The wicking requires a booster.",4
"Thermos FOOGO Phases Straw Bottle, Blue/Yellow, 11 Ounce","Had hoped to be able to pack these in a lunch box, but I can't do it without a leak. For general use, they are OK, I suppose. They leak when you tip them too much... and not from the straw all the time, sometimes it is around the general seal. Had only used one, exchanged it, but I wish I'd just returned them both. A big bummer! Overpriced for shoddy cup!",1
Potty Time Potty Watch - Blue,I think this is a great tool to use for older chidern with bladder conditions like my step-daughter. I am also using one on my 2 year old daughter and it seems to help with her as well.,4
"Kalencom Laminated Buckle Bag, Multi Paisley Watermelon",I am very pleased with the diaper bag.  It's cute and has tons of room (without being too bulky).,5
Mary Meyer Taggies Musical Menagerie Take Along Toy,My niece absolutely loves this. She loves to chew on the tags or have different textures to grab all around the entire stuffed animal. Not sure why kids love these so much but they are always a guaranteed hit with the kids.,5
Sweet Pea Pewter Pacifier Clip,I thought for the price this would be much better quality.  But it serves it's purpose regardless...,3
RideSafer Car Seat Travel Vest - Size Small 30 - 60 lb and 34 - 52 Inches - Blue,"We used this 'small' sized RSTV for frequent city taxis rides during a recent trip with our 4.5 year old girl (50th percentile height) and found this to be ideal relative to other solutions out there.  Just as some have already mentioned, she instantly *loved* this 'astronaut' vest (I was honestly a bit surprised, although we did get it in pink).  I tried it out at home before our trip so as to be more confident at the moment of truth, and found it to be fairly quick to get your child set up with the vest on and a car seat attached to it.It is very lightweight and folds in half or thirds to shove into a tote bag, including the detachable foam neck support (which we did bring along as this seemed to be something she liked about it - not sure the foam neck support shows in some online images of the vest).I would recommend this to other parents whose children meet the height/weight specs and who anticipate vehicle travel without easy access to a car seat.Although I prefer our 5-pt booster for daily use at home, I would also use this vest in a pinch if we have larger guests and really need to use all of the seats in our cars (i.e. without losing space to a regular car seat).",5
Cybex Solution X - Fix Booster Car Seat - Berry,"We commute 1000 miles per week, and my 7 and 5 year old fall asleep frequently in the car.  They always ended up slouching forward in their other seats (which were also on the ""best of 2010"" review list for boosters).  I bought these seats b/c the company said they were made with adjustable head rest to keep kids upright and SAFE while sleeping.  Well, IT""S TRUE!  I also watched the video for installation and it was a PIECE OF CAKE.  These seats were really expensive, and that doesn't always translate to ""worth it""; however, these are fabulous.  We have had them for 3 months now, and one has already required washing and still looks new.  At first my kids did not like the large profile around the headrest, but after ONE super-comfortable ride, I have not heard a complaint again.  If your kids sleep in the car, consider this car seat.  You won't be disappointed.",5

"green sprouts Stacking Cup Set, Colors may vary","This cup set it worth every penny! Our daughter LOVES it, and has since she was just a few weeks old. She's 9+ months now, and these are still one of her favorite toys! Bath time, high chair time, tummy time or ANYTIME! There are holes in the bottom, so bath time water drops are really special for newborns!",5
Kidsme Food Feeder Essential Set,"i just wish it were a little cheaper.  Walmart has some for ~$5 and this is definitely better quality, but I'm still struggling with the price.",4
Munchkin Portable Diaper Caddy (Colors May Vary),i got the light blue one. I love it for next to my bed. I use it for my newborn - fits size 1 diapers perfect.,5
"4Moms Mamaroo Infant Seat, Orange","We purchased the MamaRoo for our baby boy based on many recommendations from other websites.  The 4Moms designers really did their homework...the bouncing and swaying motion does seem to work wonders, calming down our little guy in usually a minute or two.  The safety features are great (it won't start if the seat recline latch isn't locked).  He really likes the toy balls, have it on the newborn (black and white) side right now, and the fact that the bar swings to the side easily to load/unload the baby was well thought out.  The MP3 hookup is great, we use our iPods all the time with it, but it was also thoughtful that they had some built in white noise programs that can be used as well.  The fact that the fabric of the seat can be unzipped and thrown in the washing machine is a lifesaver (already used it once or twice for unexpected messes).  Only some minor quibbles for improvement:1.  The motor is a little noisier than most baby swings, but if you have the iPod/white noise generator going you don't really notice it.2.  Although it is great that the seat fabric is removable and washable, wish it was a tad less rough...had to overdose fabric softener a few times through the wash to make it softer.3.  Would have appreciated having a battery operated option (rechargable even) in addition to plug-in power...sometimes you would like to put the seat where there isn't an electric outlet handy.Overall though, a great product!  It was also extremely easy to put together with great instructions, only one screw to put in place, everything else was an insert/zip/snap.",5
"PRIMO Folding Potty with Handles, White granite","This potty seat works exactly as I had hoped.  It isn't frilly (and doesn't need to be), but it allows us freedom to be away from home and for our toddler to use any potty safely.  It fits easily in my purse (it came in a plastic zip bag and I store it in there).  Her hands naturally stay on the handles, keeping her hands clear of holding onto the public toilet.",5
Professional Clinical Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead (Fahrenheit Readings),"Purchased this for baby shower gift.  Liked the fact that the new mom wanted something similar to this one - but this one had much better reviews - so purchased this brand and model.  And the new mom wanted something to measure temp of bath water and this thermometer does that too!  So no need for two different things to have laying around.Great price, shipped quickly!",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,I installed two of these. One in each of my children's rooms. The picture was very difficult to see. Was also very difficult to make out the sounds. I had to return the product since it did not meet the quality of a similar device that I had from 1999.,2
Littlelife Toddler Animal Daysack Parent Safety Rein/ Strap in 10 Exciting Designs (Turtle),"I have been living with cancer for five years now in and off, and I have found that I unfortunately just do not have the strength to carry nor the energy to chase our two-year-old! The kicker? This kid is a runner! Into crowds, into streets, into a stranger's can if you weren't fast enough! That's where this nifty little backpack comes in.The tether is short, but well made and strong. The pack itself will hold quite a few toys, and is very sturdy, attractive, and well-made.This was a life saver, possibly literally, when I was confined to a hospital for a month and my husband had to take care of him alone.A quality product.",5
"Moby Wrap 100% Cotton Swaddle Blanket, Moss",This blanket is wonderful.  Wish I had one for myself.  I am sure we will have this blanket around for many years to come.,5
"SwaddleDesigns Marquisette Swaddling Blanket, Sailboats, Blue","These SwaddleDesigns blankets are great because they are perfectly square for perfect swaddling every time! They also come with a handy tag reminding you how to swaddle. Though if you do it as often as we do, you can do it in your sleep (almost literally!). The marquisette is more of a muslin-type material, so it's great if your baby gets hot at night like ours.",4
"FAO Schwarz Baby And Toddler Scale, White","I weigh my son every morning on this scale and while it does do the job there are two problems that frustrate me.1 - The on button has to be pressed really hard. This doesn't seem like a big deal unless you have just placed a screaming child on the scale and realize you have to pull them off and press the button again and put them back down (just leaving him there would tare the scale).2 - The display is hard to read in dim light. I weigh my son at his first feeding when he isn't really awake and I don't want to turn on bright lights, I have a single lamp in the room. The display is also tucked up under the tray so that you have to get closer to be able to see or you are blocked by the tray.These complaints don't diminish the effectiveness of the scale, it still gives accurate weights (I use it to track how much he has eaten), and I am not planning to return it. But if given the choice I would try out a different scale.",3
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Sleeping bag, Butterflies, Large","I love this brand!  The quality of the sleep sack is on par or better than other competing brands.  Specifically, the zipper is high quality, which has been a problem for other brands (at least for me).  The only reason for 4 stars versus 5 is because of the lightweight material.  It is made with a light weight cotton, so it is really best utilized in the summer.",4
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","This is a great product & feel very comfortable knowing my baby girl is safe in this seat. It was easy to install & fits very well in my car. I feel it takes up less room then our infant seat. Granted it is higher so I can't use here baby mirrior to see her unless I put my visor down & use the mirror in there to see her. As for the delivery it was awful. UPS just threw it on my door step in the rain! I called Amazon Customer service & they where supposed to ship me a new one. Per UPS they delivered, but I never received. So I kept original seat & Amazon gave me a credit for my trouble. Other then the delivery it was a good experience.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","Love - Love - Love this product!! My 2.5 year old was resisting going to bed until the Twilight Turtle! Our bedtime routine now includes the turtle with stars/moon & she practically jumps into bed so she can lay there and fall asleep! I've been so pleased I wrote about it on my blog and facebook page and had several other friends/family ask more about it so they could buy one for their kiddos. Great Product!The blue light shines the best & green is pretty good too. The orange light requires it be really dark to show up, but its my favorite for sleeping because I don't feel like it keeps her room too bright. However, I let my daughter pick what color each night and none seem to be too bright. She always falls asleep without making a fuss now! Quiet as a peep! :-)",5
Primo 4-In-1 Soft Seat Toilet Trainer and Step Stool White with Pastel Blue Seat,"My 16 mo is underweight for her age &#62;1st percentile, however, the seat still fit her bottom well. I had also ordered the Kalencom pottette but she slid through that one and we had to return it. I thought that we would use the potty in addition to the seat, however, I have never had to use the potty. The step stool is odd shaped (potty-shaped) and cannot fit snugly by an adult potty seat or sink. I havent been able to use it as a secure step-stool for this reason. The potty seat in itself is cushy and comfortable for my baby and she seems to like it.",4
Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib,"A friend gifted us one of these when our little one was born, I bought this pack after seeing how amazing they are.  He's 2.5 and still uses them - these exact ones I ordered over a year ago.  My only complaint is that one of them seems to have some mold on the white ribbing - I've tried everything I know to get it out and it won't go away, but the other two are hanging in there great - love the washability and that they aren't 'stiff' like other plastic bibs.  Also love the neck closure.",4
"Trend Lab Cotton CribWrap Wide Rail Cover for Crib Front or Back, Blue Max Dot","Love this rail protector.  It fits my crib really well.  I was a little nervous about using ties, but the length of the ties are just long enough to easily make a good knot, but short enough that you don't have to worry about them being a strangulation hazard.  They are designed in such a way that you can tie the knot on the outside of the crib, so while my guy could play with the short strings that are hanging down, I don't think that he will be able to untie them. The only thing that I don't like is that after washing it, it dried wrinkled and it still looks a little wrinkled on the crib.  But, that's not a big deal.  The wrinkles look a lot better than the chewed on crib rail!  :)",4
Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer,We have 2 of these & always get fast & easy readings. This one was ordered for my new grandaughter!,5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"We loved this baby monitor for the first 5 months of our baby's life - easily recharged without replacing batteries, and we could hear the baby's every movement.  However, the monitor completely died after just 5 months of use and had to be replaced!  We felt that it was too expensive of an item to last such a short while.",2
"Baby Diego Bathinette Deluxe, Blue","I give 5 stars to this item just because of the final outcome. Baby Diego handles business in a very prompt and professional way. The original item shipped to me was in very bad condition. I wrote and email to Baby Diego and they called me promptly. Meri( the lady I spoke to) apologized right away and promised me a new item that they just got in stock. She sent me pictures and shipped it to me the next day before even waiting to receive the old item. I was really impressed by the way they handled the situation. I received the new Bathtub and Changer combo and it is amazing. We really enjoy it. It is different than the one ordered at the first time, but I can say it is very nice and practical.( much nicer than I was expecting)",5
"JJ Cole Bundleme Lite, Pink, Infant","This product is wonderful.  It kept my little one very warm in the winter.  There is enough room for him to move his legs around in it, which ultimately gives him the freedom that he wants.  It can be pulled to just under their neck, leaving his head free to look around and see what is going on around him.  I highly recommend this to those parents who are looking for something to keep their child warm.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"The Diaper Champ doesn't smell - how wonderful!  Also, there are no expensive bags to buy for it - you can use regular plastic bags!  Although it seems to fill up quickly(diapers tend to pile up in the middle), this is an absolute must!",4
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,Love this sippy cup! My son learned how to transition to straw after only a couple days. The weighted straw makes sure he gets the water at the bottom of the cup without having to tip it all the way back. Overall we've been really happy with this product.,5

They are packaged very well & are a pretty basic product - but they definitely do the trick (above & beyond!!!!)Thanks for the GREAT transaction!,5
"Cardinal Gates Door Guardian, Brass","I guess it depends on how it fits with your door like some other reviews mentioned, but for me it fit like a glove and seems very secure. I'm very pleased.",4
"Graphique Home Decal, Circus Pals",I bought this for my daughter to assist her in decorating the nursery.  She loved it! It was easy placement and found that she could remove them easily and reposition them. She wants to buy more for other rooms in her home.,5
"Graco SnugRide 32 Infant Car Seat, Zurich","This car seat is very comfortable for my son and I love the adjustable strap in the front.  I would recommend it, but know it is a bit heavier than some and even though it seems to work with most Graco strollers, it doesn't work with all Graco bases.  Good overall though.",4
"Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, Green/Blue","Very convenient,  is exactly what I expected.  I think my son prefers it to his $300 high chair!  Only reason I don't is the width of the tray and no grove for a drink on the tray .  However the cleanup is much easier on this little seat!",5
"Baby Aspen Little Expeditions Plush Rattle Lovie with Crinkle Leaf, Ekko The Elephant",Our grand daughter loved her Jaka so we purchased the playmate for Easter. It was the first thing she grabbed. These are nice baby toys.,5
Sassy Scrub-a-Dub Car Wash Bath Toy,"I bought this a couple of days ago for my 18 month old.  It doesn't float you put it in the tub and it will sit upright for about 10 secs then it sinks and flips over.  The cars don't actually roll so you can't even play with them outside of the tub.  Should have read the reviews first, but it was an impulse buy at the local toy store.",1
"Munchkin Quick Install 26&quot; Gate, Black","This baby gate is very study and easy to operate. We used it to keep our l'il crawler from entering the kitchen. However, we returned it because it became a hassle having to remove and replace it whenever any adult needed to use the kitchen.There is one design &#34;flaw&#34;: the description says that once you set the width of the gate to fit your doorway, it stays that way. Well, our gate would always shift in width whenever we removed it from our doorway. It may have been a flaw just with the item we bought.",4
2 in 1 Professional Clinical RY230 Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead and Surface,Works extremely well. Great if you have a sick infant/toddler.It also has mode for measuring the ambient air temperature which is really cool.,5
Lovely Flower RAINBOW Hand Crochet knitting wool Baby Hat MB186A-2,"This hat is adorable and comfortable on my little one, she loves it! good quality and does well in wash.",5
"Playtex 3 Pack VentAire Standard Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)","We got these along with three other types of bottles.  My son was spitting up very bad, so I changed his bottle after a couple days, so we could try each on I got at the shower.  This is by far the best bottle we got.  It is all we use now!!  It has never leaked on me.  It will spill out some water after you wash it, but it is only water that comes out not formula.  My son does not spit up half as much as he does with other bottles.  Every child is different, so I recommend getting a couple different kids of bottles and seeing which one is best for you and your little one.",5
5 Pack Baby Girl Bibs w/ Waterproof Liner - by Gerber,These bibs are very cute and great for feedings as they do not allow food or liquids to soak through babies clothes. They have a plastic liner which makes them crunchy and not very comfortable for long time use.,3
Walker With Toy Bar,"I for the life of me could not get the seat to stay in place. It has five straps you have to pull through slits in the back, and three plastic buttons you have to push through holes in the front that slide down. Well great, there is nothing that keeps any of those things in place! The holes in the front were to big to securely snap in and slide down and STAY down, the straps would come back out as she was moving up and down. It would have been 5stars if it was made better. My daughter loved the toy bar. I just went out at and bought another walker from another brand.",2
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"I received this as a gift and like most other moms, found the refills to be expensive. I opted for a step lid pail purchased at a discount store and use regular grocery bags. I empty the pail daily which keeps the odor down and find that I have no problems...and save googobs of money.",3
"Baby Brezza One Step Baby Food Maker, White/Grey","I received this product on Saturday August 26th, and immediately starting using it to prepare my 5 month old her first baby food. I decided to start her off with carrots and I was a little apprehensive that the machine would not be able to puree them to the consistency I needed. Well let me just say I was wrong this machine is awesome I put the carrots on and they were steamed and blended in a matter of 25 minutes without me having to watch the machine. I was able to wash dishes and start a load of clothes while the Brezza did it's thing. Thank You Brezza for making my life a little easier! Oh by the way my daugther loved the carrots.",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Twin Electric Breast Pump,"I had my son 2.5 months ago, and have been using this pump almost every day now (sometimes twice a day) for the last month and a half. It works great and is easy to put together and use. I have never had any issues with it losing suction or inadequately working. I can pump 8 ounces in 10 minutes with this pump, which is wonderful considering as a new mom I'm constantly in a race against the clock to get everything done during the day.  I am completely sold on all the Avent products, including the bottles, as well, (which all fit directly onto the pump and can be removed and immediately put in the fridge/freezer or used for a feeding) my son transitions back and forth between the bottles and breast-feeding quite easily with these bottles/nipples too. Highly recommend, especially for the price. I debated between this pump and the Medela for quite a while and decided to get this one based on price and positive reviews alone. I am so happy I did.",5
"ERGObaby Organic Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Blush Beige","I have the Baby Bjorn, a Seven Sling, and an Ergo Carrier. The Ergo is BY FAR THE BEST for women!!!!The Baby Bjorn is easy to put on over your head, and he loves being in it, but it kills my back after a long amount of time. The Ergo is a bit bulkier but it is SOOoooo COMFORTABLE that it is WAY better if you ask me! I wear it all the time, and my little man loves it too!!The Heart-to-Heart insert is definitely necessary for a little newborn baby as it keeps them more snug inside the carrier, and it supports their head from flopping around. I also have the insert with the padding at the bottom of it, but I didn't really use that one because he seemed too smashed- even at 8 pounds.Summary: I LOVE the Ergo and its accessories, including the Heart-to-Heart! :)",5
"Philips AVENT ISIS Manual Breast Pump, White","The star piece that acts as a valve gets suctioned through the hole, which means that I have to stop pumping, disassemble, put it back, assemble, resume pumping, repeat five times per session. I am careful not to create too much suction power, which makes it pop off. I have to work at barely any suction, which makes pumping tedious and takes longer.I have tried switching pieces. There are three of them that came with the pump. I am on my last one, same story.This is extremely frustrating! Do not buy this product. A big disappointment.",1
Gerber Graduates Nuk Ultimate Cup Hard Spout Dots-10 Oz 2 Pk- Girls,"we have tried several different brands but these have been the best - they don't leak, are easy to clean, and the lid inserts don't fall out whenever the cup is dropped!  would definitely recommend!",5
"North States Superyard 3 In 1 Arched Decor Metal, Matte Bronze","best gate for baby or dog gate, I bought this one and the extension becauseI have a long space area that wanted to protect from a puppy and a baby and this is perfect. easy to install and not bad on the price. very happy",5
"Child to Cherish Polka Dot Piggy Bank, Blue, Large",Put it on the food table at the one year birthday of our friends child.  She got a pig with money in it,5
The First Years Smartwarmer,"We like the convenience of this warmer.  We actually already have 2 and still chose to purchase this one. The constant water supply (rather than having to fill the viles on the others) is nice.  But this give you option to heat your bottles/jars specifically based on what you're using (breastmilk, formula, big bottle, small, etc), which is nice. It doesn't totally warm the bottle the same every time, but not sure if that's the warmers fault (was one bottle colder than the next, etc). I don't like that you have to press the button to turn it off, should be automatic. Beeping is loud, but can be turned off as well.",4
"Graco Glider LX Gliding Swing, Peyton","I saw this at a burlington and really liked the quality, but the colors matched my nursery.Pros-Easy-ish to put togetherCloth is able to be removed and washed (But not machine dried) is something gets on it... and it will.Swing motion is soothing and it is nice to be able to choose the intensity.Choice between music, ambient noise, white noise it great.Battery or plug in for swinging and musicCons-This is NOT a portable swing. Technically you can pick it up and move it, but you really dont want to do that very often and it just barely fits through doorways.. it is a bit larger than I would have liked.Vibrate is Battery operated ONLY and it is in a place that is crazy hard to get at.The cover is kind of a pain to take on and off.Once the baby reaches a certain size- about 2-3 months their legs start getting out over the edge- really meant more for newbornsThe little toy bar is pretty useless...babies dont want to look at two all grey little bears... especially when it is positioned that all they can see is the bear butts.Music quality is a little iffy- sounds like it was done on a keyboard for the classical songs.Overall -I would buy it again",4
SoHo Blue and Brown Rock Band Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 13 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"My daughter wanted a rock star themed nursery for her new son and we looked everywhere and could not find anything until we checked here.  The price is unbeatable for all of the items that come with this set.  Everything fits nice, looks nice and goes awesome with her rock star theme!!",5
Britax E9LG83N Advocate 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat w Cup Holder - Serene,"We bought this car seat for my daughter when she was 12 months old (in a different print). We bought it because of it's high safety rating and extra impact protection. When my daughter was 14 months old we were sitting at a stoplight and were rear-ended by someone going 40 MPH. I had my daughter rear-facing. The impact was so strong that it pushed the back of the car up to our backseat where she was. Because of the steel frame she was saved! We were both transported to the ER and the doctor said he was amazed that she had no signs of any injury. He said that 99% of the time all kids have red marks or bruising from the straps of their seats. My daughter had neither! She was in PERFECT CONDITION! She is 20 months old now and still rear-facing. I credit this car seat AND the fact that she was rear-facing on her being unharmed! I encourage ALL parents to purchase this car seat!Before I purchased this carseat I talked to a representative from Britax who was very helpful. I wanted to know about the fire resistant coating that was supposedly """"toxic"""" that I had heard people talk about. She informed me that they were only toxic at a certain temperature (I believe it was over 500 degrees). If this ever happened we probably wouldn't be alive to inhale it. I would rather have this coating than not.",5
"Stork Craft Beatrice Combo Tower Chest, White",Product was delievered in perfect condition with all pieces.  The only issue we had was the door on the tower didn't seem to align well at first but now it opens and closes easily after using it several times. It looks beautiful. Great price! I would recommend to a friend.,5
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,"The price was right and the quality is perfect for what this is needed for. No complaints here will get another one if needed,",5
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",The bristles are far too rough for a baby's mouth! I threw this in the garbage and purchased the colgate baby toothbrush. What a waste of money.,1
"Badger Basket Two Bin Storage Cubby, Red",We love that the kids can see all the toys.  They end up playing with more of them.  And the open design means that it's easy for little  kids to clean up and put things away themselves.,4
Kidz Med Pacifier Medicine Dispenser - Kidz Med PCFR-MD,"We have to dose 2mls twice a day to our now 8 month old -- I wanted something that would eliminate him drooling out half the meds.  I ordered a few different products and this seems to be the best so far.  The dispenser cup isn't so big that the meds get lost in the cup, in fact, you can leave the plunger halfway for a small amount.  I tried it with water myself and after I had sucked out all the water, I depressed the plunger and more came out .. the it does come out rapidly if you aren't careful.  Also closing the dispenser the first time, I accidentally hit the plunger (I had it halfway down instead of all the way open as the instructions tell you to do..) and shot meds out all over the place (oops).  But I think after the initial learning curve it will work well.  Holds a max 5mls (1tsp).  Orthodonic shaped like the pacifier he's used to.",5
"Evergreen Jungle Tree Wall Decals, Jungle Stickers Vinyl Tree","The shipping was right on time. The nursery decals are more than what I expected.  They're absolutely adorable. If you're looking for something super cute for your nursery, I definitely recommend you trying this product.",5
Summer Infant Deluxe Comfort Booster- Tan,"You have to assemble this seat, which my husband did. That was easy enough for him. It was easy enough to attach to the dining room chair. It is easy to clean. My only complaint is that the tray is kind of a pain to get on correctly. I wanted a girlie chair for my daughter, but now I wish I would've gone with the Fisher Price Healthy Care Deluxe like I had for my son.",3
"North States Superyard Colorplay 2 Panel Extension Kit, Orange/Blue","Excellent accessory for the baby.  It makes the original set larger in area.  It's a great safety measure for parents anda good balance training device for babies, for it is flexible, but strong enough for them to hold on to, while they learn towalk and climb.  May not be as effective after 18 months.",5
Playtex Binky Latex Angles Pacifier - 2 Pk - Boy,"Giving three stars because these pacifiers can only be boiled once when you first open the package.  After that, you cannot boil them or steam sterilize them.  I wish the product page would have said this.  We didn't even open the package and will be sending them back.",3
"Kid'Sleep Classic, Blue","We love this clock - got it when our older son was about 3 (he's now 6) and both he and his little brother (also now 3) are well trained not to get out of bed and bother Mommy & Daddy until ""the bunny is up!""  The LCD numbers are impossible to read from any distance, but then again they are only needed when I have to reprogram the thing (it's no good for teaching the 6 YO how to tell time, for example, or for telling time in general - you need a ""real"" clock for that.) It probably should be kept out of reach of little fingers (ours is up on a high dresser - visible but not reachable), so it doesn't get reprogrammed or even shut off.  I have no idea why some would consider it hard to program;  I find it pretty intuitive and am not sure I ever even looked at the instructions.  It does seem a little expensive for what it is (cheap digital clock with plastic panels and a light), but at the time (3 years ago) we couldn't find any comparable product, and it's been such a sleep saver (!) we are happy to have spent the money.",5
"OXO Tot Seedling Youth Booster Seat, Green",very nice product. They stay in place nice and are easy to wipe clean. Just the right height for my kitchen table.,5
"green sprouts Wooden Brush and Comb Set, Natural",it is definitely a nice soft brush but for the price i would expect more. the bristles fall of easily and you might as well get something cheaper. the wood has a platicy coat to it and it does not feel like the higher quality you would expect for the price.,3
Aden + Anais Issie Security Blanket Set Declan Elephants,"My son has never taken a pacifier, but loves to suck on blankets.  He loves to carry around the Aden + Anais muslin swaddling blankets, but they were always a pain to take in the store/car etc. I got these hoping that he would take to them, and he has! He cries when he is without it. He especially loves the satin edge around it.  As for it coming apart in the wash, that hasn't happened to us.  I usually do a load of laundry every day, and put one in each load.  I've actually been surprised at how well the stains come out of these since he has it in his mouth constantly and baby food gets on it.",5
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,"Great concept, and love the size and color, but it just won't stayed suctioned to my shower -- which is a smooth surface.",4
The First Years Hands Free Gate,I've been a child care provider and teacher for years. You come to absolutely dread going in and out of inferior baby  gates. This gate is the best. It's truly hands free and child proof. Love it.,5
"Playgro My First Soft Blocks, 0-24 Months",granddaughter plays with them all the time soft and easy to grasp been durable so far only thing i can say bad about them they do not make noises or sound as stated in ad,4
Baby Trend Triplet Stroller in Navy,"I had a surprise baby after my twins were born. I had a top of the line twin stroller for my two year old twins and needed something affordable that would fit the twins and the newborn. I ordered this stroller and I was extremely disappointed. Part of it was sticking out of the box when it arrived. It was very heavy to push and as others said, the middle seat is very tight. In addition, it is very hard to push -- it pulls to the left quite significantly. It is worth spending the extra money in order to buy a stroller that is easy to push, and large enough to hold three children as they grow.",1
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),This set worked great. It was very relaxing for my patient. I would recommend them to anyone. Did a great job.,5
Bride &amp; Groom Love Duckies Rubber Ducks Set,These dapper duckies are exactly what I was looking for. They look better in person. I can't wait to use them in my wedding!,5
"Flipple's Simple Sippy, A Sippy Bottle On-the-Go!",I thought this would be a great item to have for traveling.  I was disappointed when I tried it before going on a trip.  It leaks.  Too bad!,1
"Withings Smart Baby Monitor, White","Was really excited when I got it as a gift, particularly as it is so much simpler to set up than most other video ip  systems. But A) the quality of the link is very unstable. It frequently cut out, meaning too often I only learned my baby was unsettled because I could hear her shrieking through the door. And worse B) the quality of the construction is shoddy. Four month after I received it, it stopped working. Good luck trying to get the attention on the company.",2
Sassy Baby's First Books,I love those books. I go to my religious meetings with my girl and have to hold my bible and other book. Those books make my baby feel like she has her own book. And they don't make noise and keep her hands and mouth occupied,5
"Infantino Twist and Fold Activity Gym, Vintage Boy","For the price I don't think you could ask for more! I like the design and the bright colors. I wish the toys were machine washable but I don't think any of the toys in these activity gyms are...Baby especially likes the mirror and enjoys batting the toys. However, he might be getting bored of this already (he is 10.5 weeks) but I'm hoping he'll get into this again soon. Great for tummy time and easy to transport from room to room. (haven't needed to take out of the house)",5
Safety First Cabinet and Drawer Latches - 12-Pack,"Better then the new model, but still a pain to install and dont work all the time. But still better then the other that breaks the head all the time. If it does not work all the time why do it?",2
Piyo Piyo Yellow Baby Nail Scissors,"I had such a hard time cutting baby's nails, I tried two separate types of clippers, I tried filing, I tried biting them off... terrible results all around. I've never used nail scissors before, but I've gotten them in manicure sets and they were always so dull. I was a little apprehensive purchasing these, but I'm so glad I did! I will be buying these for any of my friends who are having babies too. They cut so easily, they are super sharp, and the curve on the end prevents pokes for squirmy baby. I cut his nails while he is sleeping so no accidents. :)",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"He never gets into playing with this, I think because it is not so easy to grab and lift. He prefers the Lamaze puppy, which has more grabbable parts and is smaller so he can lift it to his mouth.Lamaze Pupsqueak",3
"Trumpette Howdy Bouncy Rubber Cow, White","We've had Howdy for over 6 months now, blew him up with the pump Amazon recommends and haven't had to reinflate or top him off yet.  My 15 month old LOVES bouncing on him and really goes to town!  He calls him ""Moo"" and loves to practice blowing raspberries on his back.  Its a lot of fun and pretty hilarious for his parents!  The only negative I have noticed is that Howdy is a little front-heavy and tends to tip forward and land on its face.  We solve this by holding onto its tail while the baby jumps up and down.",4
Summer Infant Complete Coverage Color Video Monitor Set with 7&quot; LCD Screen and 1.8&quot; Handheld Unit,"The monitor meets or needs and was one of the few that provides for more than one monitor.  With this itmne, wse'll be able to monitor the child from more than one location.",5
Mother's Touch Deluxe Baby Bather,"I wish I would have taken into greater consideration the bad review this product had recieved.  It does not fit in my sink and when used in the bath tub, requires way too much water for a newborn.  I intially bought the product because I liked the storage aspect, well now it gets to be permanetly stored under my bathroom sink.  I purchased the old fashion tub today with a teddy bear sponge for comfort.  My little girl and I are much happier with our new purchase.  Don't waste your money on this product.",1
Baby Food Containers- Sprout Cups - Reusable Stackable Storage Cups (12 Pack) with Tray and Dry-erase Marker - 100% BPA Free (2 Oz),"I love these little cups.  I only give 4 stars because the reusable label is very hard to erase.  It seems to set with heat and then can only be removed with rubbing alcohol.  However, they are the perfect size for baby food and they store very well in the freezer.  Good buy.",4
Slip-X Solutions Tub Tattoos: Clownfish,"This things are great. I've been using them for over 6 months now and have not had issues. No peeling, etc. I did wipe down the tub with rubbing alcohol before applying them though.",5
Stroll-Air 24&quot; Universal Stroller Handle Handlebar Sleeve Cover,These are great handlebar covers.  They do not fit the bumper bars on the Bug a Boo strollers.Very happy with the customer service from ANBaby.,5
"C.R. Gibson Bound Keepsake Memory Book of Baby's First 5 Years, Lulu",This is a great baby book and seems to include everything you could ask for.  It's super cute and gender-neutral.  Other reviewers have described in detail the various sections so I won't bother doing so again.  Highly recommend!,5
Blueberry Ice - 4 PC Set,"I did not received the pictured item. When I inquired, I was informed the supplier did not offer this product and the posting was an error.",1
"Kushies &quot;On The Go&quot; Wet Bag with Pacifier Pouch, Neutral Print",i love it! i just got into cloth diapering and with all the money you first start off spending its kinda pricey and i knew i needed to have a on the go wet diaper bag... and i was already at my spending limit so i though hey if this works till at least he next time i can buys a better one then its not bad! and i love it it stays closed i've never had it leak its gone through the wash multiple times and sill standing... needless to say i haven bought another!! and they are in such cute patterns and a good size!! my baby is 3 1/2 mo old so she still has the runny poop and some times i have three or four diapers in there cover and all plus just some prefolds!,5
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel",I purchased this play yard for my home day care. It is very sturdy and works wonderfully to keep a crawling 9 month old safe. I also purchased the gray one with the extensions for use outside!I also open it up to block off a portion of my living room so he has more room for crawling - as long as you keep the panels at the recommended angles it stays upright even when he stands at it.Definitely worth purchasing!,5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"We bought this teether for our 4th month old son.  We had searched high and low for a BPA free teether that was small enough for our young teether.  Well, Sophie the Giraffe was the answer.  Our son loves Sophie.  And with her 100% all natural including the food paint she is colored with we have nothing to worry about.  The cost is worth it, she is the only teether your child will ever need!!",5
"Evenflo Big Kid AMP No Back Booster Car Seat, Red",This seat has really good padding as compared to other backless boosters. We use ours in a school carpool and it is very easy for my child to move it to different cars. She can also buckle the seatbelt herself with no problem. My daughter loves the hot pink color. Looks like clean up on this seat will be a snap.,5
"Fisher-Price Deluxe Bouncer, My Little Snugabunny",Love love love this bouncer. I haven't seen much that light up so brightly like this one. My son loved this and kept him occupied for hours. He seems comfortable to sleep in it too and it vibrates!When he got to around 5 1/2months. He didn't seem so find of it any more as he wanted to be more upright.So from my experience its great for when there young but when the want to be sat up or be more upright this chair doesn't.,5
"RaZbaby RaZ-Pak Formula and Snack Container, Transparent Blue","I had hoped that these would be simple like another brand I had purchased, but they're not.  They don't screw together easy and the openings don't line up.  Formula also gets trapped in the groove for the cap.  I would have purchased another like the previous brand, but it was too late.  Oh well.  The price wasn't ridiculous so I'm OK with it not meeting my expectations.",3
"Thermos FUNtainer Bottle, Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, 12 Ounce","I loved the thermo, the cold or heat preserved for 12 hours, live in warm earth and is super functional.",5
"The Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Aqua Stripe)",It worked great. My boy lies to move his hands alot and feet so this was a perfect solution. The hard part is going to be trying to slowly not use it any more.,5
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant",my son like this banana very much. He cried because of he was teething until he got it. I recommend it.,5
Infant Optics DXR-8 Pan/Tilt/Zoom 3.5&quot; Video Baby Monitor With Interchangeable Optical Lens,"I am very disappointed with the monitor.  It starts to beep saying out of range when we are two rooms over from the baby's room.  Also, the battery doesn't last and will start to beep in the middle of the night.  I would not recommend this monitor.",1
Redmon Fun and Fitness Exercise Equipment for Kids - Tread Mill,My three year old loves this machine.  She desn't use it everyday but it stops her from wanting to get on mine.  Good purchase!,5
Evenflo Soft And Wide Gate Taupe &amp; Chocolate,"We're the first of my siblings to have a baby. While we baby proofed our place we cant say the same for our friends and family. It can be a problem in narrow doorways in old houses and it doesn't swing open so I wouldn't use it on a daily basis in my own apartment. However, this gate is great because it folds up small and is quick to install.",4
"Munchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Vary",So this is what my husband and I came up with to help our exclusively breastfed daughter through teething. We didn't want to offer her ice since she's still so young (she started teething at 3 months) and she just wasn't taking to the teether rings yet. She liked to chew on our fingers or her own the best! She received a set of those mesh feeder things for Christmas (Thanks sister!) So we took some breast milk and froze it into ice cubes (half full to accommodate baby mouth size) and offered that to her. Success! Her look of surprise and then enthusiasm was priceless!,5
"Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser, Colors May Vary","I have six month old twins, and going anywhere with them is usually a huge headache, especially if I don't know how long we'll be out.  I used to pack up the whole formula can in a bag and take it with me along with a couple water bottles; it was large, heavy, ungainly, and a pain to measure out the scoops on the go.  It's big enough hassle formula feeding in public, what with all the nosy breastfeeding militants who don't know your situation; don't make it even harder than it has to be.I read on some of the other reviews that the lids were hard to open; I'm not really sure what they're talking about.  Unless you have no strength in your hands whatsoever (or arthritis, maybe) you shouldn't have a problem opening these.They hold at least three scoops of formula with extra room; I expect they'd hold up to four or five.  The cap is funnel shaped so the formula is easy to pour into the bottles, and there's notches to hold it in the right sections.My only complaint about this is that you can't choose the colors.  I got two pink and purple ones, and I have two boys.  It would be nice if Amazon would let you choose the colors, but it's not a huge deal to me.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I got Sophie for my baby girl when she was 3 months old. She absolutely loves her. Chews everywhere: head, nose, ears, legs. Satisfies her desire to chew & suck. She can independently hold this toy w/o difficulty. It is definitely her favorite toy!!",5
"MAM 2 Pack Rock N' Roll Silicone Pacifier, 6 Months, Colors May Vary","These pacifiers have a ""straight nipple""  I thought my son would like them because he likes the Avent bottle nipple, but they aren't his favorite.  The plastic outside doesn't ""cup the face"" and I think comes out of his mouth easier than his other ones.  I also don't like that the attachable strap only fits this pacifier.  I got ""the strap"" as a shower gift and if I would have realized that I would have returned them before opening them. So I bought these pacifiers to go w/ the straps.  I didn't not have the problem w/ Amazon that the other reviewers did.  Maybe they fixed the issue.  I ordered the ""rock n roll"" pacifiers because I thought they were cute and they matched the straps that I had.  I got what I ordered.My son prefers the the NUK pacifier.  They curve upwards to the roof of the mouth, and he seems to like them better.",3
"Munchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Vary",At first I really loved this.  My daughter enjoyed being able to feed herself and I liked giving her fresh fruit and some frozen to help with teething.  I ran it through the dishwasher and it seemed to come clean.  After I'm not sure exactly a couple weeks of use I noticed not all the food was coming out of the the bag where it is hemmed.  I tried boiling it and scrubbed it but I cannot get all the food particles out.  So this is great to use for a few times but not long term.  Will be purchasing the silicone one now.,2
Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy,"This stroller organiser is fantastic for my City Mini. There are 2 cup holders on each end with a good sized middle area between to hold snacks, keys, phone, wallet, etc.The organiser attaches to the handlebar via velco so you can adjust it to your needs. The depth of the organiser is sufficient so you don't need too worry about things falling out.There is a smell when you first take it out of the packaging but because it will stay strapped to the stroller in your apt/home/any ventilated area, the smell will quickly dissapate.I highly recommend this product. And given the many many positive reviews, so do many other parents (as this seems to acccomodate various stroller brands and models)",5
Kids Urinal Potty Training for Boys Pee 5 Color Child (Green),"excellent item. however, suction cups cannot hold the urinal for two days straight without falling but that is not a problem...",5
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"This monitor was recommended to us by a friend and I purchased it for the dual listening monitors and the fact that it had AC and battery power options. The big visual display also seemed like a plus.However, when we tried to use the monitor all we heard was interference. We tried switching channels and adjusting the volume and still only heard static or feedback. We have a lot of wireless equipment in our house and my husband thought that might have something to do with it not working. I ended up returning the monitor to the store. Since then I purchased a Graco monitor and have had no problems with static.",1
The First Years - Crib CD Player,"I love this product I use it for my 9 month old, I also used it for my 5 year old when she was a baby.  I put different cd's in and it attaches right to the crib and it's perfect to get the little one to sleep.  It also has a night light attached which is a great addition.  I would definitely recommend this product.",5
"Boppy Boppy Signature Style Slipcover, Grey","I love this Boppy cover for middle of the night feedings. The pink side is wonderfully soft and the printed side is beautiful. It's expensive, but I haven't found any Boppy covers that are inexpensive.",5
Munchkin Five Sea Squirts,"These are the cutest toys for the little ones to use while being bathed!  My grandson loves using them - he is a little young yet to grasp the technique of filling them up, but he is having a lot of fun with them anyway.",5
Jeep Backseat Organizer,"This organizer is perfect for my toddler to keep his books, toys, and drinks.  It also helps to protect the back of my seat from his shoes.",4
Bumkins 3 Pack Waterproof SuperBib,So far I love these bibs.  They are super easy to rinse and hang to dry -- I can rinse it off after a meal and it will be dry and ready to use by the next meal.  I also love that they are machine washable. My son has food allergies so I need to be able to wash everything to fully eliminate any food residues.  I only gave them 4/5 because I haven't had them long enough to comment on how well they hold up to multiple washings.,4
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,"I bought this chair after using my sister-in-law's Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair and saw how nice it is to have one when there are no high chairs, like a campground, where we were. This one is definitely lower quality. The chair itself isn't as stiff but I don't feel that it's unsafe or uncomfortable. It does what I need it to do, which is keep my daughter in one place while she eats, and for half the price of the Chicco.",4
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Pink",My little guy was a preemie and at 9 months is only 15 lbs 25.5 inches long.  This chair fits him very well and has for several months.  I love that it has three reclining positions.  It's a good quality high chair.,5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I have two little grand daughters, one 7 months and one 12 months. I keep this high chair at my house and strap it to a regular chair. It is very safe and secure and they are very comfortable and happy in it. Good quality, light and can take anywhere. Highly recommend!!!",5
Maxboost Fusion Snap-on iPhone 5S/5 Case - Navy Blue (Fit Fusion Battery Case for iPhone 5S/5),This item was perfect. I love it. its better then I imagined it to be. and is in perfect condition.,5
"KF Baby Animal Beanie Hat, with Ear Flaps and Braids, Owl, Pink + 4 Pinback Buttons",My granddaughter wears her owl hat all the time and loves it. It is durable and washable. The color is perfect.,5
,These make the food taste bad and they smell so strong like rubber (like new cheap tennis shoes).  I can't use them.,1
Temporary Earrings by bINK'd GLITTER &amp; GLOW IN DARK Butterfly Combo,"My husband and I didn't want to pierce our daughters ears, yet, but she is a fashionista so I bought here these. She loved them so much.  Gramma got her ears pierced so we no longer needed them for her hears but she still loves to wear them.  If her nail beds were bigger I would use them on her fingers.  She has extremely sensitive skin and these did not bother her.  They lasted for a month before I removed and reapplied.  They were simple to apply and take off.  For tots, that is important.",5
Graco Bumper Jumper in Little Jungle,"This should not be this difficult to do but apparently it is and without everyone's feedback i would not have been able to figure it out.  Personally, it's not worth the hassle....it's going back.",3
"Motorola MBP33 Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 2.8 Inch",wonderful tool to have for the baby.  so convenient and easy to use.  now we can be sure to notice if anything is wrong while baby sleeps.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Sea Turtle",This little turtle is so very cute.  I hope my nephew will like it.  Can hardly wait to give it to him.,5
Fisher-Price Brilliant Basics: Snap-Lock Beads - 12 Shapes,We use these for my daughter's therapy as a means to improve her fine motor skills. It helps to strengthen her fingers and she has fun at the same time.,5
GoGreen Champ&reg; One-Size Cloth Diaper (R2D-Poo),Item was delivered on time and as expected.  I haven't used this yet but I believe I will be happy with it.  It is well made.,5
Trend Lab Max Dot Blooming Bouquet Hooded Towel,"Really wasn't worth purchasing as the fabric isn't that absorbent and pretty harsh for a little baby's skin.  Cute, Yes!  Practical? No!",2
2-in-1 Professional Clinical RY210 Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead and Surface,"I am a registered nurse in a skilled nursing facility. I work at night, so I prefer not to have to wake my residents up while doing their assessments. This product allows me to get their temps without waking them up or disturbing them by either running something across their foreheads or putting a thermometer in their ear correctly.",5
Fisher-Price First Steps Jumperoo,"This jumperoo is awesome. First off it is square and much lower profile that all of the other big obnoxious ones with the big curving poles...second...it is very nice & springy. I love the nets on the sides as a catch all for the extra loose toys I give him...nothing goes flying! the seat swivels well, the height adjustments are fantastic (he is just now 5 months and his lil feetsies are just now reaching the ground fully)...he is going to have SO much fun with this! He LOVES the red frog withthe jungle sounds, lights & tunes....he spins the clear piece with the little balls inside and also spins the purple butterfly. Only thing is that he is obsessed with the switches for the lights & music and the volume which are located on the base of the frog. Soon he will be able to turn them off & on himself which is a touch annoying, but it's not that big of a deal...I just think maybe they should have made the control switches inaccessible to baby. The walker function is cute too, not the reason we bought it, but it's a nice little bonus. I feel like this is great for about 15 minutes at a time for him, since he hasn't started really jumping much yet & I don't want him to get overstimulated. This one is much less over the top in the overstimulation department that all of the other ones I've seen. Some are downright eyesores, and just have TOO MUCH going on. This one is just right!",5
"Philips Avent iQ24 Sterilizer with 2 Bottles, 9 oz","We bought this product out of frustration over sterilizing bottles for our 2nd son.  Now we wish we had this when our 1st was using bottles.  It is a really great product.  There is not much to do with it.  All you do is stack the bottles (in neat trays that come with it) and turn it on.  One thing i would recommend, use distilled water.  I read this in another review on Amazon.com, and i think it is a great idea to keep the coil clean.  There is not way to clean the heating element, so using distilled water is the only option.",5
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","Tough stroller, well built, light, opens and closes easily!!!  Well recommended for the price.  Not the Walmart  $25.  quality,  this one is sturdier and feels stronger and safer.  Wheels work perfect on grass, sidewalk and rougher terrain too!  You get your monies worth for the additional few dollars.",5
SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket Very Light Kiwi with Pastel Kiwi Dots,I have 5 of these blankets and I love each one of them. They're very large so they're great for a cover for breastfeeding or using as a floor blanket for my baby. They're soft and very attractive and I get compliments on them often. They're the perfect blanket for swaddling and everyday use. Buy 2 so you have one available when 1 is in the laundry.,5
"HALO SleepSack Applique Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Blue, Medium",My only complaint is that its slightly difficult to get the zipper started.  Im a grandmother who needs a larger tab.,4
Whoozit Starz Lights and Sounds Activity Toy,"This is another of the Whoozit line, and very faithful to the others.  The fancy addition is two small blinking LEDs in the arms along with the music the toy plays.  My daughter loves the toy- I was somewhat disappointed that there were not more lights on the toy- I think it could have had 8 to 10 lights on it.  Also, you must continually pull down the string at the bottom of the toy to get it to light up and play the music- still too difficult for my daughter to do at 7 months, but I hope soon she'll master it.",4
"Angel Dear Pair and a Spare 3 Piece Blanket Set, Frog","I received the bunny version of these eight years ago as a gift for my daughter.  She loved the soft snuggly feel it her bunny.  I ended up buying two more so I could keep them rotated and washed.  This also allowed them to all wear equally leaving her unable to pick a favorite or tell the difference between them.  When my son came along two years later, I purchased the bears for him.  He loved them just as much as his big sister did.  Now I like to purchase the boxed set of three to give as baby gifts.  There are so many cute animals to pick from!  The blankets are just right for little hands to snuggle up with and drag around when out and about.  They wash and dry well without fading or pilling.  The more they are washed, the softer they become.  My kids still drag theirs out of the stuffed animal pile and play with them from time to time.  I think that speaks volumes for how much they love their lovey!!",5
Kalencom Potette Plus Liners - 30 Liners,"I love the Potette Plus in terms of its convenience and accessibility. I literally take it everywhere with me when I'm out with my 24 month old. However, the liners are really ridiculously expensive. Once I go through what I purchased, I will get regular small plastic garbage bags, insert a paper towel inside and let my toddler go that way, which essentially what these liners are - minus the baby powder scent. You can get small plastic bags at Walmart, which are quite large, in comparison and can fit completely over the bottom of the potty, so it helps protect the potty itself from dirty/unsanitary floors and public toilet seats. The Potette plus liners fit pretty snug around the potty and exposes the bottom of the potty on the floor, so I'm having to sanitize it after each use. Overall, for a product that is highly pricy, I would expect a better bag. (FYI: You can now find portable potties that are bagless!)",2
"Dr. Sears Nibble Tray, Yellow/Green, 12 Months","My daughter is 15 months and happily munching on finger sized foods.  She attends daycare and I found that I was packing what felt like 10 different plastic containers or ziploc bags just to keep her food separate.  This is perfect! I haven't used the chilled leafy section yet, but when I get around to making jello, I will.  She doesn't quite understand dipping her foods in sauces yet so it will be a while til we use the section for that.  I highly recommend this product!  It feels durable and we can put it in the dishwasher (a huge plus!)  I haven't tried to test whether or not the liquids from each section will spill into the other sections if tipped over - but when I have extra time (haha) I will.",5
"NUBY BPA FREE No-Spill Cup w/ Soft Spout &amp; Handles, 1-pk, Girl Colors","I wish I had gotten this one first. I always try to order the baby products with the highest ranking reviews. That did not work well with sippies. This is the only one that DD likes. Just make sure you align the two bumps on the plastic cover with the two little indentations in the soft nipple-like spout (see the very edge). Otherwise, this cup will leak- a lot. But in as long as you take the extra few seconds it takes to align those together, not one drop. Previous sippies included Dr. Brown's amongst many others.",5
Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate,"This gate is sturdy, but takes forever to get in place.  I didn't use this gate for the 1st three months we had it because even with the directions we could not get it firm enough to stay in place.  Any odd widths, slightly uneven walls or unparalleled walls (such you would find in an older home) makes this gate a pain!  It took me an hour to put it in place the first time and then another hour and a half the second time.  I would have returned it if I could in a flash!  There are much better designs out there and it's not worth pinching a few pennies.",1
"Trend Lab CribWrap Fleece Rail Cover for Long Rail, White, Wide","The crib wrap works well and keeps my daughter from chewing holes in her front rail.  We have the young America my haven crib and it fits with no problem.  Good product, just wish it was a little cheaper.  Kind of a lot to pay for a piece of fabric with some waterproof backing.",4
Britax B-Nimble Mosquito Net,"Based on other reviews stating this cup holder works well on Maclarens, I had high hopes. I was so desperate for a cup holder that I ordered it from the US to ship to the UK (decent shipping time, fyi). I have a Maclaren Techno XT (2011 model, if that helps anyone) and this does in fact fit on the square tubing PERFECTLY. Plus, no hacking required to get a good fit.Shame that the Britax logo is so huge but whatever. Minor detail.After searching high and low for a cup holder to fit on my Maclaren, I am over the moon about this! Highly recommend.",5
Philips AVENT Isis On The Go Set,I love this breastpump! I just had my first baby and I use the pump on a daily basis. It is so easy to use and very comfortable. (and the price is right!) I definitely recommend this one to all the moms out there.,5
"Philips AVENT Translucent Orthodontic Infant Pacifier, Clear, 0-6 Months","She had latched onto to these pacifiers quite well, however, not latched as in &#34;I need my paci&#34;. Once she's had her comfort, she spits it right out, which is a plus!",5
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Miracle, Black/Silver, Cotton Mix","It's in the expensive side but it is very comfortable, highly recommended. My baby loves it. It does allow me to have free hands.",5
Xlarge Gorgeous Owl Tree Wall Decal Nursery Bedroom Decorative Wall Art Sticker Removable Colorful Boys and Girls Party Decor Wallpaper Spring Home Decoration,"Looks great and easy to put on the wall, but it keeps peeling off. It is also not big as in the picture.Have to trash it as it will not stay put.",1
"Graco Modern Pack 'N Play Playard with Bassinet and Changer, Zurich","We love the design, the color, the style, everything about this pnp. We purchased this exclusively instead of a crib and have no regrets. My 4 month old has since out grown the changing table but we still use the diaper compartment.  She is still in the bassinet and she's a big 16lb 4-month old baby. So it is sturdy and comfortble for her. When she gets a little older, we'll let her sleep in the bottom section. I purchased a 3"" mattress pad for the bottom that fits perfectly and will be her bed until she can't sleep in it anymore!",5
Naturepedic LS54L Organic Kapok/Cotton Standard Size Pillow (20x26) - Low Fill,"If we are putting our heads to rest every night on a pillow, it's best to be breathing in organic cotton as opposed to pillows treated with other toxins. Especially for kids!",5
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Galaxy Grey",I bought this carrier as a gift from a Baby Shower List and the receiver of the gift loves it.,5
"Evenflo Exersaucer Triple Fun Active Learning Center, Life in The Amazon","Wonderful investment & endless hours of exploration of shapes, forms, sounds & colors. I bought it as a gift for my 5-month old grandson and he's really enjoying himself when in his Rain Forrest. Shipping & delivery was super fast. The package literally contained 100+ pieces so assembly IS required. But it's totally worth the effort and the little man LOVES his toys. As he moves around, the chair moves around with him.  It's very energy consuming for a 5-month baby so in the beginning, he could only take 20-30 minutes of exploration. This is an absolute favorite among his toys and I highly recommend to everyone.",5
"Scootababy Baby Carrier, Taupe","This is one of the best investments I have made regarding baby products. I recommend this carrier to any parent who wants to carry their child and retain the ability to use their hands. I have twins, and frequent our local farmers' market with their grandmother in tow. She had so much trouble wielding the old Infantino carrier. Now, it takes her less than a minute to get this carrier situated, with a baby in it!All you do is snap it around your waist, place your baby wherever you want on your upper body (either side, front, or back), pull the strap over your head and tighten...with one hand! This carrier is well-made, sturdy and the fabric is thick. Everywhere we go, people constantly ask me about this carrier...and I happily tell them.",5
"3 Packs of NUK Replacement Silicone Spout, Clear",I was having a hard time finding the replacement spouts for my daughter's sippy cups. I received exactly what I ordered in a very timely manner.,5
"Evenflo Switch A Roo, Apple Book",I have 2 babies and 2 exersaucers.  This toy is the very first thing they alway grab.  They love the fish. My toddlers also go over and grab it quite often.  A very worthwhile toy.,5
"Philips AVENT 9 Ounce BPA Free Natural Drinking Cup, 1-Pack, Red",I have purchaed other advent products and had great experiences. But this was not the case with this product I'm uncertained if it's a manufactures defect because it leaks. My daughters always has spills on her blouse when ever she use it. I'm tring to wean her into cups so I thought this would be ideal but it's not effective.,1
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium",Love this product! Keeps my son's arms swaddled much better than other products. I struggled a product that would keep his arms secure because he was around the 70th percentile when he was 4 months old and most products were too big around or too short.,5
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"Out of all the bottles I've tried, my baby seems to prefer these.  That's okay by me since they fit my Medela pump.  I really think they are quite expensive, though.",4

"Mary Meyer Inspirational God Bless Baby Musical Sleepy Lamb Plush Toy, White","I love this!  I had ordered another musical stuffed lamb, but when i saw this i ordered it and am soooo glad i did.  it is so soft and it plays the wholes song, not just a phrase, perfect for my new granddaughter!!",5
Medela Pump In Style 9 Volt Advanced Breastpump Battery Pack,I have no problems with this battery pack; works wonderfully!  Make sure it is compatible to the pump you are using!,5
"Graco RoomFor2 Stand and Ride Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis","It is exc...when you have 2 small kids, very easy assembly also....love it!!! and the price is very affordable Recommend 100%",5
"Hudson Baby Coral Fleece 3D Animal Blanket, Blue",I bought this as a baby shower gift and my friends loved it. It is so soft and super cute - a great gift!,5
Infantino Foot Rattles,"I am not unpleased with this purchase but a bit disappointed.  while they are very cute, the ""rattle"" feature doesn't rattle, very subdued noise. Also, while I was excited to see them on the Amazon site, I was a slap in the head to see them for $3 at Target.  Still, they are adorable.",3
"Baby Deedee Sleep Nest Baby Sleeping Bag, Dream Blue, Small (0-6 Months)",This is a great alternative to blankets for our infant son.  He stays warm all night and we do not have to worry about him getting cold or about the blanket wrapping around his head.,5
Safety 1st 2 Pack Grip n' Go Cabinet Lock,Please don't make the same mistake we made.  do NOT buy this product.  You must have hands like Houdini to open it.  Maybe this would be good for cabinets you rarely if ever want to open.,1
Sassy Ring O' Links 2 Pack,Didn't think baby would like these SOOO much... but after taking so well to his 1st set (that we string across his lap in the carseat) we decided to get two more sets... we keep them around the house...We might hang his other toys from them... or we might just give him 2-3 to hold onto through-out the day!These are a winner!,5
"RayShade&reg; UV Protective Stroller Shade Improves Sun Protection for Strollers, Joggers and Prams Black","We have a Jeep umbrella stroller and the sunshade is ridiculously small.  We were going to Disney with our family and I knew I either needed to find a new shade or a new stroller before we went.  I really couldn't justify getting a new stroller so I figured we might as well give this shade a try.  I'm SO glad we did!!  It was super easy to put on, it folded flat and was able to go in our suitcase, and it did an excellent job of keeping my 4 year old out of the super hot summer Florida sun!  It was a little too big because it hung down over her face a bit (it pretty much went past her knees)but it was perfect for what we wanted it for.  I highly recommend this if your umbrella stroller sunshade is small and flimsy.",4
"Munchkin Baby Bath Ball, Colors May Vary",Got it when my baby was only a couple of months old and she still loves it and she's almost a year old.,5
Fisher-Price Crawl-Along Drum Roll,My son is only 4 months old now but he loves to watch the lights on this toy.  I know that when he starts crawling he'll love to follow it around the floor!Great toy!!!,5
Munchkin Bath Super Scooper Turtle,"Stays on the wall fine.  Easy to take on and off hook.  Holds a good amount of toys, but not as big as I expected.  I do like it though, and it is really cute.",4
"Prince Lionheart bebePOD Flex Baby Seat, Mint","this does the job. it seems like a tight fit, but my daughter always fit fine. by the time she was too big for it, she could sit up on her own. so it did its job.",5
Safety 1st Prograde Finger Pinch Preventer (Pack of 2),"The manufacturer says that use of this over time can damage your hinges.  If you have a hinge that is not very strong it can happen the first time it is put to the test.  I had it over the top of my (old) dryer door.  My little guy likes to &#34;help&#34; with the laundry but I was afraid he would pinch his fingers at the hinge side.  The first time I used it, I forgot it was there and tried to shut the door.  It changed the shape of the hinge just enough that now the door doesn't shut quite right, and I have to force it closed.  So just be careful. Also I didn't realize when I purchased this that there are 2 to a pack. I missed that somehow. And I am just not using these as much as I thought I would - probably not one of those necessary purchases.",4
"Joovy Tricycoo Tricycle, Greenie","I bought this trike for my 14 month old, knowing she would need to grow into it.  She loved it from the first push.  Everytime she sees it in the garage she runs over to it and tries to climb on or put things in the basket.A few notes:  Assembly was easy, took about 20 minutes.  It has a solid feel and I think it'll last through her toddlerhood.  Overall I'm pleased with the purchase.My primary complaints (and reason for 4 stars instead of 5) are:1. the steering handle for the adults is a bit wiggly and loose feeling.  It would be a little more comfortable for the adult driver if the handle was a bit wider and steering more responsive.2. the footrests are place a little too far back for my daughter to comfortably use.  She ends up resting her feet on the mudguard for the front wheel or sometimes drags her toes which is concerning.3. when the safety arms are in place and your child is holding onto these instead of the handles it's easy to pinch fingers if you steer too sharply.  This happened a couple times without injury or tears, but you do have to pay attention.I expect all these issues to be resolved when she is using the trike herself with the safety arms and adult handle removed.",4
"Bummis Fabulous Wet Diaper Bag, Green, Small","I could not wait to get the diaper bag, envisioning a bag that would keep the mess in. I even ordered two so that when we went places and had wet bathing suits that the wet would stay in while in transport on the way home. I opened one right away and started using it. After  a couple of wet diapers were in it  I noticed moisture on the outside of the bag. So I thought maybe they need to be washed first like cloth diapers do , so I opened the other one and washed it before using it. It got wet as well. It seems that moisture is able to leak through the bag, or seams somehow, and is not 100% waterproof.",3

Reusable Food Pouch (Pack of 8),"For too long I've been spending a small fortune on Ella's Organics and other similar products trying to get my toddler to eat his vegis. Now with these I can make my own. They work great. I was originally worried about the bottom zipper coming undone or not really getting them clean, but neither is a problem. Its a great product and I am so glad we got them. I have 8 so far, but will likely add to my collection soon.",5
