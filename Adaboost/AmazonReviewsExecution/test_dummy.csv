"OXO Tot 4-Piece Feeding Set, Green",Meals can be quite stressful in our house but now they are a little less messy.  My daughter likes to throw things including her dishes.  With these she has a much harder time since the entire base is rubber.  The side lip around the plate that is removable helps keep her food in the plate and get it onto the spoon.Great dish set even though it's pricey.Highly recommend!,5
"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red",When shopping for an umbrella stroller we wanted something compact and sturdy. We also didn't want to spend a lot of money for a stroller our child will outgrow in about 30lbs or so. This stoller meets our expectations and the price is great. I have read complaints about not being able to lock the stroller but if you are standing behind it there is a small red latch next to the pocket that locks the stroller in place.,5
"Skip Hop Moby Bathtub Elbow Rest, Blue","Recently purchased this, so I've only used it a handful of times so far. Can't complain about much as of yet. It does the job. We've used it on the kitchen sink and on the bathtub so far. Easily switches between the two. The majority of the padding is on the top (for mom/dad's elbows) but the neoprene sides are also very handy for extra protection for baby's head/hands/feet/body in case of accidental contact with the edge of the sink/tub it covers.Haven't really used the zipper compartment. The rest has three suction cups to attach to the tub/sink walls (one on one side, two on the other). Dries out quickly (we toss it in the front loading washing machine on 'drain' and its done).Very pleased, will recommend to others.",4
Cloud b Mimicking Monkey,The &#34;white noise&#34; function on this thing is so quiet that we had to send it back.  My baby requires LOUD white noise to sleep through the night and this guy wasn't even close.,1
Evenflo Single Breast Pump,I used this product because my son would not latch and I had to pump.  This product works well for the price.  It may be a bit noisy but it works just fine.  I have had it for 3 months now and it is still giving the same resourcefulness as when I used it the first day.  I needed to express milk for my son and this product helps me to do that.,4
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","Mt granddaughter always cried when we put her in the carseat,until we put this in they crying has stopped . It's soft and comfortable. I was sold when the crying stopped. Excellent product.",5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce","This is the best bottles ever build.  My baby, (3 month old) is happy besides is BPA free..  I recommend it.",5
"Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White",So far I have only used this for feeding but it helps to provide support to my arms when feeding.  Cannot wait to start using it to prop up baby.,4
"Chicco Smart Support Backpack, Red","No problems with it.  Rugged construction.  The windshield is really great.  Very sturdy, and easy to put together. does an awesome job no matter what the terrain.",5
"BRICA UV Alert Window Shade, Gray","I was looking for shades for the back (side) windows in our Jeep and these are a great fit. My husband said they were very easy to install.  There is a button at the top to press for retracting the blinds. Couldn't be more easy and convenient. They look nice and neat, too.",5
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush, Blue",I don't know why would it matter that a brush is made with BPA plastic unless you are planning on boiling it. But this product is great. It is lasting 6 months so far.,5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof SS 7 Ounce Sippy Cup with Handles, Pink, 6 Months","For parents who are concerned about chemicals in what  has become traditional baby products, this is a great non-bpa replacement for the plastic sippy cup. My daughter is particularly fussy about the recipient she's drinking out of and I was very surprised she accepted this in no time, as I involved her in opening up the Amazon box and be surprised by what she got.The only slightly negative thing about it is that it often takes several attempts before you can properly fix the spout in the lid hole. Once it's done it's totally leak proof.",4
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,This monitor works beautifully. It is so clear that we can hear the baby breathing while he is sleeping. I definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a good baby monitor.,5
Tobbles,"MY Grandson loves this toy when he is not playing with it  i am playing with it, colors are vibrant and it is quite amazing how they balance on each other  Another Pulu...Guess what NO Batteries either...",5
'The Insulated Sippy' by Eco Vessel Insulated Stainless Steel Sippy Cup - 10 Oz - Hudson Blue - 10 oz - Container,Pretty.  1 yr old has not gone for using this odd nipple as a sippy for longer than 20 seconds.  I'm sure he just needs to get used to it and our personal transition is going rocky because I introduced it after 9 months.,4
"Luvable Friends Flannel Fitted Crib Sheet, Yellow Circle",I love these sheets for our cold Michigan winter nights.  Great fit and soft too.  They hold up well after repeated washes.  Would recommend.,5
Beaba 3-Stage Baby Bottle Training Sippy Cup - Pink,"My daughter has loved this cup since we bought it over a year ago -- it's always been her favorite, first with the nipple, and now with the regular top.  Even though she can drink out of a normal cup by now (she's nearly two), she still prefers this one.  And if you put the lid on tightly it doesn't pop off.  They key (and this took me a while), is to make sure you press down firmly on the top and make sure it's down on all sides (this sounds more complicated than it is).  If you do that, no problems.  Promise -- ours has been dropped many times...  Also, it's dishwasher safe for real, unlike a lot of others that degrade over time.  This has gone through literally hundreds of times, and still looks brand new.  Totally worth the extra money -- you'll love it.",5
Hello Kitty Large Collage Pink Childs Backpack,This is perfect for any Hello Kitty fan.  She loves it!  It was delivered on time and in perfect condition.  It's a little bigger than I expected but she will grow into it.  It's great!,5
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Snow","I was delighted to receive the bundle me for a baby gift but was quickly disappointed when I realized the car seat straps thread through the ""fleece.""  This can potentially cause problems with getting a snug fit and can increase compressibility in an accident. There should be nothing between your baby and the car seat except for a layer of clothing.  I liked the idea of having a built in blanket but did not want to compromise the safety of my child.After examining the Bundle Me I decided to ""cut out"" the back panel where the straps thread through.  This allowed me to place the cover in the seat without worrying about having to thread the straps through the thick fleece  Now, my baby is positioned directly on the carseat but is surrounded by the Bundle Me.  It truly is a perfect fit, the straps are not hindered by the bulky fleece and I am no longer concerned about compressiblity.It was an easy enough modification and I wish the manufacturer would adopt this change.",4
SOHO 4 in 1 Soft Kahki Diaper bag,"I loved the design, and I still do, but the size is weird, very square, and seems to be cheaply made.",2
"C.R. Gibson Loose-Leaf Memory Book, Baby Bots",This book is awesome! It has pages for everything u could possible want to record. I love the fact that u can add pages along the way and page protectors to put memorable items in.,5
"Delta 48 Piece Nursery Storage Set, Beige","Great starter set for a new baby's closet.  Hangers are the perfect size for baby clothes and the 3 small bins fit into the hanging organizer like drawers.  Color is neutral and great.  The dividers and stickers were kind of worthless in my set though.  Most of the stickers wouldn't peel off the sheets, so they ripped and had to go in the trash.  It didn't really matter though - the dividers just spin around the closet rod, they aren't weighted, so even if you manage to get the stickers onto them, chances are slim the label will actually be visible.  Not a big deal.  For the price, everything else was great!  If I need dividers I can pick those up elsewhere.  All in all this was a great purchase, and I'm pretty picky.",4
"Munchkin Nursery Projector and Sound System, White","Fine when it works, which is for about 2 months.  I have gone through three of them, too bad they aren't more long lasting.  The sounds are pretty good, the nightlight is useful, and the projector works well mostly (hard to keep focused well).  But the killer issue is that it just stops working after 1-2 months.",1
Regalo 192-Inch Super Wide Gate and Play Yard,"I bought this pay yard for my four-month old puppy and I am very satisfied.  It's sturdy and safe.  I like the fact that it can be made into a circular play yard or protective gate.  It hasn't tipped over once, despite a 30 lb puppy jumping up and putting his paws on the top.  I especially like the gate latch and how it opens to the inside.  No bolting!  Definitely a quality purchase.  Arrived on time and great price!",5
"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","Our 6 month old loves her """"Wubbzy""""!  I would highly recommend it for any youngling who prefers a pacifier. It is nicely weighted so it sits on baby's chest and is easily accessible.",5
Playtex BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottle Newborn Starter Set (Packaging may vary),Our baby had terrible gas and reflux. These bottles helped reduce the air going to her belly. They have multiple parts but you get used to assembling and cleaning them quickly.,5
"Sassy Grow Up Cup No Spout, No Spill Design 12 oz - 18 Months","I ordered these cups to transition my son to a regular cup from a sippy cup.  They are colorful and they hold enough liquid to satisfy him.  I do have to say they do leak of you turn them upside down, but then again maybe I did not tighten it enough.  They are easy to clean and fun to drink out of.  My daughter who is 7 really enjoys them and they are fun enough that even I drink out of them!  For a set of two you will be pleased",5
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,"There's another seller asking 35 or so for it, or you can check online auction places. This sellers price is completely insane and ticks me off. Freaking robbery, and you should be ashamed of yourself.The bathseat however, is great. It's most definitely not worth THIS sellers asking price. But it's worth it's ORIGINAL selling price which is between 20 and 30'ish.",5
"Sealy Natural Cotton Crib Mattress Pad, 52&quot; X 28&quot;","This mattress pad was exactly what I was looking for. It arrived on time and I was excited to give my son a softer place to sleep. After a wash, an air dry, and an air spin in the dryer it was nice and fluffy. The magic ended as soon I put it on the mattress. It was not a tight stretch at all but as I pulled it over the third corner, it ripped. The side stretchy material tore away from the topper. I thought at first I might be able to stitch it back together but the tear just keeps getting bigger. I assume since I already washed it, it is nonreturnable and we will have to find a different product. Bummer.",1
"aden + anais 2 Pack Muslin Burpy Bib, Princess Posie","These bibs are super soft and absorbent. They provide great coverage. I like that they use snaps instead of velcro. The snaps on one of my bibs broke, so I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement bib. Great customer service!",5
Prince Lionheart Jumbo Toy Hammock,"We put this over the baby's crib, filled it with toys, and put a video baby monitor in it too. I want to train him early that someone is always watching and listening to his conversations. Welcome to America, Baby.",5
"Safety 1st Sweet Wonder Play Yard, Cubes",Happy with the product. Durable and of better quality than others I've seen. Highly recommended.,4
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,My husband thought this was a well made high chair it was easy to put together because everything went it its respective place.  The straps and the seating are easy to adjust and my grandson loves it!,5
Philips AVENT Isis iQ Duo Twin Electronic Breast Pump,"After reading many reviews, I decided to purchase this pump instead of the medella pump in style.  I was a little unsure because I couldn't find as many reviews on the avent pump because it was fairly new.I am very happy with my decision.  I get 6-8 oz in only 10 minutes.  The bag is very roomy and looks great.  I thought it was a little pricy, but I purchased mine on ebay brand new in sealed box and saved over $100.Some cons are that you need to wash and sterilize the horn and attachments every time you pump, so I tried to purchase an extra set to rotate.  WOW EXPENSIVE!!!  It was going to cost me $130 for the extra set.  Almost half the price of the entire pump.  So I have been using the medella quick clean wipes to clean my pump parts at work.  They work out great!  Avent also needs to make a battery pack or car adaptor.  When you travel or for just a day trip, you must have access to electric!  I just took a weekend shopping trip and it was a big hassel to always find a place to plug the pump in.",5
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack",I was given one pack of these bottles at a gift at my shower. They looked really confusing to me but thought I would give them a try. My baby almost never had gas. They cut the air right out of the bottle and he loved the shape of the nipple. These are a must have especially with a colic or fussy baby!!,5
"Born Free Twin Pack Wide Neck Bottles, 5 Ounce",I like that the bottles are BPA Free - I feel good about using them to feed my baby.  But I don't like dealing with the extra vent parts - it's just more parts to wash.  I tried using the bottles without putting the vent in and the nipples just collapse - so you have to use the vents.  But overall I like these bottles.,3
Dream Baby Door Catches 2 pack,"Work well, and they are easy to install. Attractive looking. If I need more catches, these would be the ones that I would order. Price could be lower though",5
beginning... by Maclaren Connecting Massage Oil,Excellent but a little fragrant. Works great! And is perfect for baby massage. Bottle is easy to grip  And doesn't pour out too fast. Excellent,5
"Dr. Brown's Standard Dishwashing Basket, Polypropylene","So glad I bought this! It fits all of the pieces perfectly and gets them cleaner than the other baskets I've used. It hold parts for 3 bottles and takes up less room than other baskets while ensuring all of the parts are washed properly. I highly recommend buying this if you have Dr. Brown's bottles, as it makes washing them in the dishwasher much more convenient and does a much better job than other baskets (the straws don't hang down, the tops don't flip over, and nothing overlaps).",5
OsoCozy Better Fit Unbleached Prefolds (Infant 4x8x4 Fits 6-16 lbs.) - Dozen,"Excellant absorbency (you should boil them before use) and they have lasted through probably hundreds of washes.  They are soft for baby, too.",5
PumpEase Classic Collection hands-free pumping bra - Verry Cherry - M,"As a new mom I dreaded pumping each day... it just wasn't pleasant for me.  Buying this PumpEase bra made it much more bearable.  I don't even have to think about the pumping happening... I can instead use my free hands/free time to read my Kindle, return email, or just chill out.  Sizing chart was true to size.  I've been using it daily for over a month with no stretching and no complaints!",5
Colgate Mattress 13 x 27 x 2 Oval Replacement Mattress Pad,probably lucky they are out of stock on this item.  the mattress is a thin piece of foam covered by plastic - all for $48.00.  i expected a little more for my money.  really SAD!,1
"Kiddopotamus Dreamsie Sleeper with Sleeves Microfleece Small, Blue","This immediately became a favorite with my daughter.  She puts the baby in it every night, washes beautifully (every day).  Highly recommend this product.  Everything was shipped quickly and arrived in great condition.The only problem I had was, it did not come in pink in small thru the website.  This was for a first girl, but fortunately, no one minded it was blue because of the warmth and convenience each night.",5
"Boon Gnaw Multi-Purpose Teething Tether, Grape/Kiwi","It's ok by my judgement but my twins LOVE this. They fight for it. Even though you're supposed to put a biscuit or teether thing in the green netting portion, my twins like to bite on it just as is. It's a little dangerous when they fling it around since it's a bit long because it's reallymeant to be snapped onto something but my twins pull it right off when snapped onto their clothes.",3
Snug Square Play Mat (Cream-Espresso),"Most comfortable play mat for baby, even has space where I can lay and play. Very comfortable! Makes me want to fall asleep on the floor. I nominated this for a Cribbie. A must have for any baby from tummy time and beyond!",5
Long-Range Vibrating Baby Monitor,"I just wanted to recap what the ""toy enthusiast from MA"" said below:""I did however find a company that actually made me a new rechargable battery. The company is called Battery World ([...]) The battery was about $13.00 US and it worked great. So for all you Moms who love this monitor but need a battery here is your solution. ""We also own the original version of this monitor, the battery died after about 2 years of use, and we have ordered the replacement battery from Battery World - $15 US. Keep up the good work Battery World!",4
"Door Monkey, Childproof Door Lock &amp; Pinch Guard","This is an absolutely brilliant invention. It is by far the simplest and easiest-to-operate of any child-proofing door solution I've ever seen. No fiddling with doorknobs or intricate catches, and it doesn't leave any scratches or dents in the door or frame. And it's much, much less expensive than other solutions that allow for airflow.Place it out of the reach of infants and toddlers but within the reach of small children to allow the older kids to get in and out without risking the baby falling down the stairs or smashing fingers in the doorjamb. It's also great for keeping the cat out of the bedroom and guest room&#8212;or in the room with the cat tree if we have workers coming in and out of the house over an extended period.As a super-awesome bonus, it also allows for decent airflow.Children with separation anxiety may be comforted by being able to see their parents through the modest gap.Seriously, the inventor deserves a medal for this.",5
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet",I have trouble putting my baby to sleep every night without rocking her in my arms for at least half an hour. Until I purchased this product when my baby girl was 3 months old and have been using it ever since. We just hang it on the crib and turn the mobile projector on every night. The first 10 - 15 minutes she would be talking to the animals until she gets tired and falls asleep by herself. i strongly recommend this product to anyone. This product is an excellent purchase! It helps your baby train to sleep by herself. One suggestion for parents who would purchase this product is when you hang it on the crib dont put your baby directly under the projector. Place it where the baby would be looking down a little bit because it somehow forces her eyes to close and make her fall asleep  faster.,5
CNC-KE Taby Tray White,"The car tray is great.  My grandson loves it.  It allows him to drive his cars while we are traveling.  He loves the cupholder, too.  I like the ridge around the edges that keep things from rolling off the trays.",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",This is a great litle learning toy and night light. The display of the moon and constellations on the ceiling was very clear. We gave it to a 4 year old and she was delighted. She gave us a big smile big hugs.,5
"Safety 1st Alpha Elite 65 Infant Car Seat, Rachel","This is a great car seat for the baby. It is set up so as your child grows, it accommodates for his/her size. The material is top notch in quality. I couldn't find any flaws in it. The cushioning is comfortable with sufficient padding. It also fit easily into the van as well as the sedan. I think this is a great product and I give it five stars.",5
"NUK Ultra Thin Breast Pads, Pack of 2, White, 120-Count",I bought these because they were cheaper then the pads I normally buy. I regret not spending the extra $2! I woke up this morning with a soaked Tshirt because they had leaked. I'm going to stick with my normal brand.,1
Boon Flair Harness/Buckle,Exactly what I needed. I wanted light nuetral 5 pt. harness straps to attach to a wooden high chair I'd salvaged from a thrift store. These do the trick nicely and work well.,5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My toddler LOVES his turtle! It's a huge comfort for him while falling asleep. It's especially great because it turns off on its own after a while, so he doesn't require a night light all night long. Great product! Super bright!",5
"Regalo Maxi Super Wide Walk Thru Gate, White",This lasted outside through 4 NE winters.  I just replaced with same brand/type of gate. Use to keep Min-Pin in either front or back yard.  He does not jump on it.  Not the strongest gate for a small child or a dog that would try to jump against it.  But is just what we needed and held up outside longer than we thought it would!  I recommend that Amazon sell the extensions for this gate also.,5
"Munchkin 12 Ounce Mighty Grip Toddler Sports Bottle, Colors May Vary",Does not spill. It is a little hard for my toddlers to actually suck the water out but they are getting the hang of it.,4
"American Baby Company 3-Piece Portable/Mini Crib Set with Large Espresso Dot, Blue","Keeping in mind I haven't washed this yet..This set is so soft and way cuter than it looks online. I noticed some fuzz (from the blue parts) hanging on to the brown parts of this, but a swipe of the hand takes it off quickly.Everything fits, but the fitted sheet sides could fit better. I have a mattress that is less than 3 inches wide and the sides creep up a tad, though it's not bad enough to worry about. I also thought it was strange that the ties on the bumpe aren't where the four corners are but instead end up a rail or two after the corners, but maybe that's just installer error (it's been awhile since I've had cause to put a bumper on a crib!)Considering how difficult it is to find a bedding set for a mini crib, I would gladly recommend this to anyone looking for such an item. I would probably purchase this for a regular crib if they came in that size if that says anything!",4
"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Froggy","It is such a cute potty.  But for a boy who has that certain type of equipment, it doesn't protect your floors or walls.  Definitely needs a front cup for a boy.  But I also have a girl, so works nice for her.  Just wish it could accomodate me for a boy.  But it is cute  just not efficient.",3
"green sprouts Stacking Cup Set, Colors may vary",Our LO loves these a lot!!  They go with us everywhere as a must have toy. She loves to take the apart and chew on them too.  These can be used in the water which is a great use too.,5
"OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Pink","This wipes dispenser is the cats pajamas!!!  Works great, there is an internal weight that keeps the wipes from bunching up and we only get one wipe at a time!!!  This is our 5th child and don't know how we got by without this all of these years,this thing is a game changer.  The lid has a good quality rubber seal that keeps the wipes moist and they never dry out.  The lid is spring loaded and opens with just a press of the lid keeping your other hand free which is great for those times when changing diapers is like trying to subdue an angry Wildebeast  Very nice product,HIGHLY RECOMMEND!",5
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","When I first bought this, over a year ago, I was hesitant about the price - it being so low compared to other brands. Rest assured, this is all you will need! My finicky baby had to have his warm Alimentum. This bottle warmer is sooo quick and easy, I could put the water up to the predetermined line of the measurer(that comes with) poor it in and left it alone. It was ready within a minute and after a few shakes, it was the perfect temperature. This is also helpful for warming up baby food jars (Comes with a special attachment just for that purpose) The warmer was dropped twice on the floor so it can defently take a beating! Outside is easy to clean (the water deposits on the warmer - not so much) All in all It did the job for my little boy. And for $16 GET IT! And Get one for the Grandparents! Don't spend $30 on a bigger and bulker item that will do the same thing!",5
GEENNY Musical Mobile For All Star Sports CRIB BEDDING SET,It was a joy to see my son entertained by this mobile. All little boys love sports and this was just perfect for him.,5
Boxy Backpack Diaper Bag - Rhone Blooms,"I purchased this bag when I had my 3rd, after using boy diaper bags I wanted something more feminine. Def had to be a backpack as I had a 4 year old, 2 year old and newborn. I bought the stroller clips to use on our bugaboo and they work fine, just wish it was standard on the bag like some of the other brands of diaper bags. I LOVED having the zip out diaper changing station-absolutely a lifesaver for anywhere diaper changes. Liked the side pockets for water bottles and sippy cups/bottles, but sometimes they would fall out if I bent over (maybe needs a drawstring closure??). I used the bag both ways (backpack and messenger style) and I prefer the backpack.  It just seemed to wide to use as a messenger back IMO. Also wish there was a top handle and padded shoulder straps. On the plus side the material is completely wipeable and durable...the embroidery stitching is NOT. mine has snagged :(  The color on this particular print is not overly pink but definitely feminine with the soft pink flowers and interior. There is the removeable zip pocket in the inside for mommy stuff and two interior pockets....lacking IMO, the bag needs more. And the bag never has felt like it can carry everything I want to take, I'm usually left deciding on what to pack and leaving some stuff behind because it won't fit.  I'm going to try the Mrs. Smith's bag and we'll see if I end up selling my PPB!",4
"Harmony Kids Standard Rocker, Hot Pink",This is a big hit at our house.  This was a gift for my 18 month old on Christmas morning.  She was so excited to see her own sized chair and has sat in it every day for almost a year.  It's still a good size for her!,5
MAM Silicone Ulti 2pk Pacifier in Box Assortment,"I ordered these to have some variety in the pacifiers that my daughter has. The pacifiers that arrived are adorable, but there is a problem. The packaging says MAM by Sassy, but it does not say BPA free. I called MAM Baby as well as Sassy and neither company could verify whether or not the pacifiers are BPA free. Sadly, back they go.",1
Mommy's Helper Cushie Traveler,"My 3 year old is just finishing being potty trained.  I tried the flat foldable toilet seat for travel and she hated the &#34;pinch&#34; and wanted padding.  This seat is very portable, fits nicely in my diaper bag, and she has no problem using it out.  It folds to about 7inches long by 4 inches thick.",5
"Recaro Vivo High Back Booster Car Seat, Midnight Desert Micofiber","My almost 4 year old really likes this seat, as do I.  It is very heavy, much more substantial than some of the other brands I have looked at.  The only complaint I have is the fabric it is covered in is hot and I am a little concerned about how it will clean. Overall, a great seat.",4
"Philips Avent 10 Pack BPA Free Breast Milk Storage Starter Set, Clear, 6 Ounce","I intended to use these for breast milk storage, but since BF didn't work out for me, they were stuck in the closet unopened. Now that my baby is weaning, I decided to give these a try for homemade food storage. They're excellent! They hold enough food, seals well in the freezer, pops out without any effort and I know exactly how much I'm feeding her. I seriously love them! I can make big patches of food, immediately freeze them. To defrost, I run them in water for a few seconds, open the lid and the contents slip right out to a bowl to heat up. Easy peasy, no spills and no messing with cling wrap! Best part is they're BPA free.",5
"Jeep Stroller Parasol, Black","Brakes easily, however a good size to use with a small stroller or carseat .  Black but looks cute for a girl",1
MDR Store Faux Leather Skull Clutch PU Purse Rings Duster Knuckle Style Party Bag,"this bag is sick, sick, sick!  mad compliments!  quality of skulls is impressive & bag looks like real leather.  so hot!  cute!  sick!!!!",5
"Baby Buddy Secure-A-Toy, Navy/Red","These are very handy to have around, secures toys or handled cups to the stroller. One did start to fray at the end after only a few weeks of use.",5
Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate,"My wife purchased this gate for then entry way between our living room and dining room.  I found it fairly easy to operate, but the clasps that hold the gate apart inside the fabric failed sending my twin daughter and son head first into the dining room.  The simple truth is that this item should be recalled.  It is substandard construction and will result in injury to you or your child.  If I could figure out how to do it, I would contact the company and ship the piece of junk back to them at my expense.",1
Yummi Pouch (Set of 6),"Im a mom of 3.  a daughter, 3yo and twin boys 18mo.  life is crazy!  to say the least.  and I hate messes, which is inevitable.  The reusable pouches have become an everyday item, a must for us!  breakfast, or snacks.... I mash up a smoothie and they chug it down, with no mess. I had been using the little green pouch and the infantino diposable and silicone ones,but after around a few months the little green ones didn't clean up well.  The fact that they were a very stiff material, made it difficult to get in the spout area or to the bottom creases, where food gets trapped.  The infantino ones were nice but you threw them out, and their silicone reusable ones, were hard for the little ones to suck or squeeze them to get everything out.  I just received the Yummi brand ones in the mail, and I love the feel.  they are similar to the disposable ones so easier to clean, and easier to get out.  So far, I have no complaints but Ive only had them for a few days, so that's why I only gave 4 outa 5 stars.  Oh and I ordered on their website and received them within 4 days!  love that.",4
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"This monitor is great for our house and we live near large power lines.  No static at our house but when we went to visit relatives in NV, lots of static.... so, I recommend that you try it out first.  Have had it on 24hrs a day for 2 months and no problems at our house!",5
Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer,I had purchased this Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer to be delivered to my parents house to use while home for the holidays.  I feel condensation is leaking on the outside.  Overall works well and I love the fact since I have a high watt microwave I only need to microwave it for 2 minutes.Given the option between the Advent and the Munchkin I feel the Advent is better quality sterilizer but it is still an overall good option for the price.,4
"Graco Pack 'n Play Sheet, Grey","The Pack n Play sheet is neither quilted, nor Tarragon. It is grey. The description and price do not match the item.",1
"Bunnies by the Bay Buddy Blanket, Skipit","Our daughter loves her """"la la"""" she won't sleep without it.  We now own three of these and have them in a rotation for getting washed.  The bunny looks a little worn but it does get washed every few days. The pink blanket portion has stayed soft on both sides.  We have bought several bunnies as gifts as well.  Highly recommed.",5
"Summer Infant Plush Pals Changing Pad Cover, Green/Brown (Monkey)","it is beutifull and soft, color it is ok, the qulity it is so high, i love it, i love it, and it is perfect size for the chngid pad",5
Jolly Jumper Bath Tub Toy Bag,"I purchased this item thinking it could hold a few small tub toys. It does that if it you like them on the floor.  The suctions haven't worked properly since day one. My shower tile walls are clean. It """"sucks"""" when you get scared half to death wondering what that loud crash was in your tub when it falls after you are already out of there.",1
"Fuzzibunz One Size Diaper White, 7-35 Pounds","I bought this diaper because our OverNite Disposable Diapers were still leaking and baby boy was waking up cold and wet :o(. We tried doubling up the disposables and that didn't work. Finally a Friend tipped me off to buying a diaper like this to cover over the disposable and it works! Early this AM baby boy took a big poo in his disposable which leaked over onto the Fuzzy Bunz and I was extremely impressed how well and easily the Poo washed off the extremely super soft, fuzzy FuzzyBunz. Wow! Also, even with the double up baby boy  seems comfortable in this diaper. The adjustments are very good.",5
"AM PM Kids! Reversible Placemat/Chalkboard, Hoot Owls","Got it for my granddaughter, she's two years, and still impatient for her meals.  This keeps her occupied while waiting. Only bad thing is, not all chalk will work on it, I guess just the chalk that comes with it, not good when you lose the chalk, or throw out pieces when they break. Have to find out what kind of chalk it is, and where to get it.",4
"Pressions Handprint and Footprint Kit, Honey","We did impressions of our 5 month old and after many many many (~30) tries, the results came out great!  You just need to exercise patience and know that it will ALL be worth it in the end when you have this wonderful keepsake.  We watched the online video available on the Pressions website first and took their suggestion to do one foot imprint at a time.  I loved that these are 3D and are raised so you can see all the details, unlike the other kits out there that are recessed IN. Also, I really don't like the thought of the ink kits, even the invisible ones.  Just because you don't see the ink on her hands and feet doesn't mean it's all gone!  This kit is a bit expensive, but when my little girl is all grown up, I will not miss the $45 I spent and will just be happy to have a memory of the time she and her feet were so tiny.  I just wish I had gotten this kit when she was younger!I agree with some of the other reviewers that this is a 2-person job and that if your baby is still young, doing her footprints intead of handprints will be easier.The prints are made by pressing your baby's foot into slightly wet sand.  If the print doesn't come out right, just smooth out and try again. Once you are happy with the result, you pour some quick drying Plaster of Paris into the mold and let sit for a few hours. Once dry, you turn the whole thing upside down and all the sand will fall out except the grains stuck onto the plaster.  I took a small art paintbrush and lightly swept more of the sand away to better show some of the details and plan to buy some sort of clear protective coating to apply on top.Just remember to BE PATIENT (and make sure that your husband is, too) and don't settle for a print you're not happy with.  That is the beauty of this kit; you can try and try again!  It will all be worth it!",5
"Cosco Juvenile Funsport Play Yard, Kontiki","A little tricky (not difficult) to dismantle, but otherwise a great, affordable option for occasional use. I found instructions on how to take it down on YouTube.",4
Playtex 2 Pack VentAire Silicone Slow Flow Nipple,"We have slow flow nipples but these are just bad, might try to make the hole a little bigger to help it along.  Drips without any sucking occurring.Believe the issue is the baby isn't sucking properly on them to get anything out?  Child can handle 3 other types of nipples fine...",2
"Joovy Room&sup2; Portable Playard, Red","I have absolutely no idea why I never thought to send this back, or to call customer service about the horrible, horrible smell of this play yard, but I didn't. The smell has never gone away, and we have had this play yard for over a year. So to any of you who have one and think that the smell will probably just dissipate, IT WILL NOT. I'm very concerned about it now that I've discovered some of these arrive with no smell. I think I just thought that all play yards must smell, and generally assumed it would go away eventually, but it never has. The major question is: WHAT unnatural thing was used in the manufacture of *a place for babies to sleep* that would STILL smell this horrid after over a year of ownership? I will be calling them tomorrow and will update this review with their response.In terms of general quality, it's incredibly well made and very solid.  Maybe because it's so solid, it's very heavy.  You could see that as a positive or negative depending on whether you leave it set up in a room or pack it up and transport it often.  The sheet that comes with it is really soft, but white--not the best color for a playpen floor, really, but that's a minor complaint.  The smell has me worried, and that's not a good thing.  We parents have enough to worry about without adding this sort of thing to the mix!",2
"Jeep Wrangler Twin Sport All-Weather Stroller, Heat","I thought I had read enough reviews but apparently not.  Nice enough barebones stroller but doesn't fit through the doorways in my house leaving me to collapse it for storage which is sometime a pain.  My only other complaint is that there is only a lap belt and my 11 month old can bend forward practically out of the stroller.  So overall it's okay, not totally what I expected.",3
Meeno Baby Cool Me Seat Liner Stroller - Baby Blue,"works amazing on our City Select stroller, especially in the AZ heat!",5
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White","Bought this to keep the dog out of the baby's room.  Fits in a 30&#34; door frame and works well.  The top closure piece (that you can operate with 1 hand) was a little scuffed, but it doesn't interfere at all with its operation.  I (small female) can easily open this gate with one hand while holding the baby.  You will need to push the button on the top, as well as pull up the handle on the underside of the operator.  It's very easy.  I can do it with 2 fingers and a thumb.This gate also has a stopper on the bottom that allows you to either have it open only one direction, or swing freely in both directions.  It does not automatically close on its own.  And I do have to push it to close it (to make it latch by itself) or manually latch it behind me.I will definitely buy this again and am thinking about it to put in the bathroom to keep the dog out (although the opening is 55&#34; and I don't think that this one goes that far.)",5
Sunshine Kids Ultra Mat - Gray,This mat is perfect to protect your vehicle seats!  We have a suburban-so they are larger seats and it covers the whole seat and has a good size pocket in the front to store items.  I would recommend this item to save your vehicle seats!!,5
"Arm &amp; Hammer Secure Comfort Potty Seat, Colors May Vary",We have two of these - they're great. I don't care about the little arm and hammer thing.. but it's nice that there's no weird padding or whatever to get pee in it. Just sleek and wipeable.,5
"Britax Boulevard 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Onyx",Be aware that the item is really a different color than what it looks like online. It looks blue online but is really different shades of purple with pink edging.,3
"North States Supergate Slide-Step and Lock Open Gate, Burnished Steel","Bought three gates from three different brands. By far it&#34;s the best, although cheaper than the other one I got",5
Plush Penguin Hat With Long Paws,"Bought this for my 10 yr. old granddaughter who adores penguins.  It is so cute, sturdy, and well-made. I can wear it myself, including the mittens!  She is nearly as tall as me, and a little crazy lol and I know it will be one of her favorite Christmas gifts. It's warm, too, which really makes it outerwear, as well something to play with.",5
Eddie Bauer Sport Pack Diaper Bag,"I thought that this Eddie Bauer diaper back pack would be the answer to my problems.  I need to have ""free - hands"" to take care of baby Melody, but just weeks after I purchased this item, the lining started to come out (just like the other reviews).  I am totally disgusted with it.  At first I loved it because it has front compartments for my things and a back compartment for all of Melody's things, but now with the lining falling out it is not as good as it originally seemed.",1
"Munchkin SpongeBob SquarePants Click Lock Insulated Straw Cup, Colors May Vary, 9 Ounce","My nephew was extremely tickled and carries it  around everywhere.He is a spongebob over the top, totally focused funatic.",5
"Disney 4 Piece Toddler Bedding Set, Taking The Race",Omg when I received this eventhough I was pissed off at fed ex that carrier sucks.. anyways good quality my son loved it was jumping up and down.. such a beauty... Also got it at a 50%off.... I'm in love with amazon good job....!!!,5
Fresh Baby So Easy Silicone Food Tray,"Prior to getting this food tray, I'd been using regular ice-cube trays.  Effective, cheap, and a pain in the tail to get the cubes out.  I would need to let the tray warm up a little bit, then twist and bash for a good 5 minutes to get all of the cubes out.  The flexible silicone allows me to pop out the cubes quickly and easily.  The 8 -1oz squares allows me to easily freeze one cup of food at a time.  The silicone cleans very easily, which I love.  My one minor negative is that, since the silicone is soft and flexible, it can be bit difficult to tap the whole tray againt the counter to get thicker purees to settle in the blocks, but that is easily outweighed by the positives.",5
"Stork Craft Beatrice 4 Drawer Chest, White",We got this dresser to match the crib we bought elsewhere.  The dresser matches the espresso color of the crib.  The only thing was that one of the cam lock pieces was damaged and there were not any extra in the container so there is one place on the dresser that is not locked together correctly.  Other than that i am happy with it.,4
"Bella Tunno Happy Knees Protective Pads, Tutti Fruitti Blue",Not a bad product. Just too tight on my sons legs,3
Earlyears Lil Shopper Play Set,"Nice little set, 9month old that received it enjoys it, only real complaint is the lack of bread, I mean really when you go shopping you get milk, produce, but come on, you have to get bread! I can even imagine how it could have a crinkly wrapper and everything, plus there is room in the bag for it. Seems as though it was omitted to save $, though otherwise it is fun. I thought I would like the cabbage the best, but the apple has a great chime inside, not sure who enjoys it more, me or the baby.",4
Crib / Toddler Baby Pillow - Made In USA,"I got this to go in the crib I just purchased but the pillow is too big for standard-sized baby pillow-cases (about 1/3 or 33% too big).. :( Otherwise, it's soft and very puffy.",2
"Carters Velour Playard Fitted Sheet, Ecru","This sheet is really soft and fits our Graco Pack n Play very nicely.  It also seems to hold up well in the wash.  My only complaint is that it seems to be visibly warn in the spot where our little girl usually slept while in the pack n play.  She didn't sleep in the pack n play for vey long so I was surprised by this wear.  I would definitely buy again, though, since it was so soft.",4
"Silly Billyz Towel Bandana Bib, Fuschia, 0-2 yrs","Love this bandana for my little drool monster. It's soft, easy to put on and looks very cute. Great item to have in your diaper bag!",4
Evenflo Soft And Wide Gate Taupe &amp; Chocolate,I don't normally write product reviews; but news about this gate is worthy to be shared! My 10-month-old daughter was constantly crawling around my feet while I was cooking in the kitchen. This gate fit perfectly in the wide space between my kitchen and dining room and has given me so much peace of mind.Other perks: It's attractive and easy to climb over. Oh! And no hardware to install. Just perfect.,5
Munchkin Bath Dunkers Toy Set,Did not stick to tub well at all,2
"Thirsties Diaper Cover, Celery, X-Small (6-12 lbs)","If you're doing your part to save the environment as well as some cash by using cloth diapers, this is the diaper cover to own! I used the small diaper cover from the time my son was a newborn (7lb 9oz) until he was 7 months old (18.5 lbs). When he was a newborn,the leg openings were a little big, however we overlapped and angled the side velcro straps when fastening to minimize the gaps and never had a problem with leakage. We used small sized pre-folds as well as old fashioned fold-them-yourself diapers which fit perfectly in the small sized Thirsties.We went up to the medium sized Thirsties when we upgraded to the large sized cloth diapers. He could still fit the small Thirsties if we used medium sized diapers. I fully expect the medium sized Thirsties covers to last him till he's potty trained since there is a wide range of adjustments.These Thirsties are easy to clean and dry quickly on the line. They seem to be comfortable and breathable since we've never had a problem with diaper rash and my son has very sensitive skin. They also last a long time! I received my first Thirstie from a friend who used them for her two sons. The velcro isn't as strong as my new covers but strong enough to hold the cover on. We've never had a problem with leakage on that one either and this is the third baby bottom it's covering!",5
"American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Chenille Fitted Contoured Changing Pad Cover,Ecru",I bought this as an extra cover for my changing pad.  It matches my green nursery perfectly for a boy or girl and it so soft!  I'm sure my new baby will love it!,5
Britax Back Seat Mirror,This is the PERFECT mirror if your baby is in the rear middle seat and the seat doesnt have a headrest!  It easily straps to my rear driver side headrest and swivels so I can perfectly see my baby rear facing in the middle seat.  Wish I wouldve found this before I wasted money on a regular mirror and a mirro that was supposed to stick to my back windsheild (but didnt)!,5
Sassy Baby Sweet Dreams Crib Mirror,"Our baby doesn't seem much interested in this. Granted, I can't ask him why, but I can only assume that he can't possibly recognize the distorted face in the mirror as his own, or even that of a human. Frankly, the ""funhouse"" effect of this mirror would freak me out a bit if I woke up with this in my face.",2
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,I used my wedges to prop up a broken shelf in our RV.  Very useful little widget.,5
Leachco Easy Teether XL - Crib Rail Cover For Convertible Cribs - Chocolate,We needed something to protect our brand new expensive sleigh style crib.  This works great!  The baby loves the toys that hang on it.,5
"BOB Duallie Snack Tray, Black","It is a snack tray and does what it is suppose to do.  I do like that it installs so easily on this new model, unlike the older model.  My kids like to have a place to put their toys, snacks and drinks while walking and this works great.  The cup holders could be a little deeper for taller cups, but we have never had any problems.  Overall good product, but it would be nice if some of the accessories came with the stroller as this is now the second one I have had to purchase since the first was the version with the car seat adapter on one side and snack tray on other side.",4
The First Years Star Teething Blanket,My son loves this blanket. He likes looking and talking at the starfish and enjoys chewing on the different fabrics.  He finds the squeaker portion amusing and also just squeezing the blanket and making it krinkle.,5
Eddie Bauer Adjustable 3-in-1 Booster Seat,"This car seat seems like a good design until you try to put it in a vehicle. It's nearly impossible to reach behind the armrests and base to buckle in, whether you are using the belt or the latch straps. Also, my boys' heads fall forward when they fall asleep, restricting their airways. I hate these seats, I returned them both today after giving them a couple of months, and I am buying something that might be a little more expensive than the $55 each I paid in favor of something that is easy to put in and out, and comfortable for the kids.",1
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Newborn Napper, Melbourne","I LOVE the bassinet and changing table, but now my baby has transitioned to the crib portion. The mattress support is made of little more than 4 pieces of fiberboard. After sleeping in it for a month or two the mattress sags and buckles. I've attempted many times to line the boards up straight in a row, but as soon as baby lays down they get out of alignment again.",3
"South Shore Savannah Collection Door Chest, Pure White","Kind of flimsy. Quality is not that great. But, considering how much an item like this in real wood would cost, it's not too bad. You basically get what you paid for.",3
Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 4 Wide Neck Nipple,"I changed it just now, and it takes just 2 min for him to drink milk, so fast, love it!!!",5
Ginny Fraser 11 Piece Jungle Nursery In A Box,This is the most wonderful bedding! I bought this set for my daughter and a year later it still looks as good as the day I pulled it out of the bag. It has been through 3 moves and suffered all sorts of abuse and is still like brand new. I think its defentially a great deal and worth it! I couldn't have picked a better set. The colors are so bright and bold. The animals are so cute and fun! I loved all the extras and the mobile plays a sweet song. Defentially the set to buy if your doing jungle theme!,5
Munchkin Portable Diaper Caddy (Colors May Vary),The product seemed big from the image on the Product Display page. But when the caddy arrived it seemed pretty small with little space. We were totally unsatisfied with the product.,3
"Kid Shield, 15' Roll for Banister Safety",It arrived fine shipped not damaged just have not needed to use it yet. This just reminded me to get it out today and use it for my stairs or my railing.,5
"Britax Parkway SGL Booster Seat, Cardinal",Great fit for our four-year-old boy. He can fasten his belt by himself. Nice to have him be involved in the mad dash out the door.,5
SUPER ABSORBENT bandana dribble bib by Zippy Suit (baby toddler / Light Pink),Very baby soft & absorbent. Pink is a very pale pink. I like that it has two adjustable snaps to go around baby's neck.,5
Wubbanub Pacifier Pouch,"When I had my babies this was not yet out.  I purchased this along with some of the pacifiers and I was thrilled with the size, feel, and clip.  I think that this is a great addition to the product and it is a good idea.",5
The First Years miPump Double Electric Breast Pump,"This device was defective, it was easy to assemble and it didn't work. I bought this for my daughter and tragically it didn't work. She is a first time mother and needs to pump. Sad to know it doesn't work",1
Totally Toddler Stain Remover -24 fl oz,"Our son has pooped in his car seat,  spit up all over our couch and stained every piece of clothing and this seems to do the trick every time. Very happy with the product.",5

Hygeia Mother's Milk 3ct Storage Containers 4oz,"The Hygeia was not my first choice for a breast pump, but the pump itself works great and I have no complaints with it; these bottles are a different story! The first time I placed them in my microwave sterilizer, they SHRANK! They melted, became misshapen, and the number measurements were off by a full ounce! The standard Medela and Lansinoh brand storage bottles both work well with the Hygeia adapter, and I have not had any issues with the plastic melting in either of these (after two months of usage/once weekly sanitation).",1
Levana Jena Digital Baby Video Monitor with 8 Hour Rechargeable Battery and Talk to Baby Intercom,"Finally, a noise free monitor! My husband can sleep now, for there is no interference noise.Cons: haven't figured out how to keep the video turned on when in battery madeThe screen sometimes darkens sporadically on the upper area",5
Juvenile Solutions Baby Cubes Baby Food Storage - Eight 2 Ounce Cubes,These storage containers work well for the early stages of food introduction. They stack nicely and don't take up too much space in freezer. Better than the small cube trays with covers I think.,1
"Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory","I have to say everything about this pillow is pretty much wonderful.  I gave it 4 stars because it's a little too hard for what I like by my head.  I've woken up twice now with a sore ear.I bought this because I am a back sleeper and during pregnancy they say it's not really good to sleep on your back.  I'm 26 weeks pregnant and even with a few pillows surrounding me while I sleep I was waking up on my back.  I finally broke down and bought this $70 pillow.  It keeps me on my side and even allows me to sleep slightly on my back without really being on my back.  Exactly what I needed.  Again, it's a little hard by my ear, but maybe it soften up a bit after more use.",4
"Stork Craft Beatrice 4 Drawer Chest, White","Product came with instructions for a 3 drawer unit, had extra parts, holes for KD fittings were too large so fittings fell out during assembly making assembly difficult at times...for the price was not near the quality a product that one would expect. Once completely assembled was fairly sturdy but don't expect it might be a long term investment.",3
Maxboost Designer Slim iPhone 5S/5 Case - Rainbow,I received a free sample from VIPU program for evaluation and the case is really pretty with good quality. Just have a try and you will never regret.,5
"Quickzip Crib Zipper Sheet, Blue Mink","LOVE these sheets.  Bought them for the wintertime as I figured they'd be warmer for my little love, but I still use them now in late spring/early summer as they're so soft and she strokes them with her sweet little hand as she falls asleep.  I also think they helped when she was still sleeping on her back with reducing the hair loss on the back of her head from turning her head back and forth!",5
"Baby Trend Sit N Stand Double Stroller, Elixer",Highly recommend this stroller for any parent having two little ones close in age. Right now I have a 3 year old and 1 year old and I am expecting another little one in a few months. I love it and my kids love it too. It's not that heavy for a double stroller I can easily lift it and I am 33 weeks pregnant. It's also very easy to convert the stroller to your liking and I love the fact it grows with the child.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Mom and Granny love this cot.  Our toddler is a little squirm bug in his sleep.  He's not quite ready to sleep in a big bed, or at least we're not ready to have a fall out of a big bed!This cot is perfect!  It's lightweight and it's low to the ground.  If there's a fall out of the bed, it's only 8 inches or so.  That's a lot less a fall than from a regular bed.  It's good practice for when we transition to a full sized bed.",5
Clay Handprint &amp; Footprint Keepsake Photo Desktop Frame - Black,"My son's hand and foot prints came out great!  The negative is the picture frame to add your picture is not 5 x 7, it is not 4 x 6 either is some odd size. We had to cut down the picture to make it work.  Buyer beware.",2
"Summer Infant Ultimate Crib Sheet, 52&quot; x 28&quot;","Hi - In concept this is a great idea, but I want to make sure people know about certain limitations.  Because of the placement of the securing straps, this sheet CANNOT be used on convertible cribs with a solid headboard.  You must have slats on all 4 sides of the crib - or be handy with a needle and thread.Just want to make sure people know, as these sheets are expensive and I was very disappointed to learn that I am unable to use them.",3
Jumbo Toy Hammock Net Organize Stuffed Animals,Not so easy to install,2
"Boppy Changing Pad Cover and Liner, Heirloom Flower",Vibrant and does it's job! Kept my changing pad clean and i just needed to wash the mat! This held up well through washing.,5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"I live in a horrible place, where it snows from as early as October and continues until as late as March. I have stuff to do that requires walking outside, so we bundle up and carry on. This stroller is an immense help with that. Ive driven it through as much as 2 inches of snow with no problem; over thick ice on the road it does fine, through icy and snowy parking lots with uneven ground - no issues at all. The wheels still look great, and my child is comfortable. I use a toddler sized bundleme on this just fine, and also one of those jeep rain guards when needed. I am very pleased with this, especially for well under a hundred dollars.",5
"SoHo Nap Mat , Classic Pink &amp; white Leopard Print",because it's not from %100 cotton it makes a lot of static electricity. some kids are really sensitive to that,3
Westminster Hand Boilers (Colors May Vary),People love to ask me &#34;what is that there on your desk there&#34; and I watch them pick it up and pray that they don't drop it.  It is fragile.That's all I have to say about that.,5
Piyo Piyo Yellow Baby Nail Scissors,I opened these and threw away the package but I just realized that they are not baby nail scissors that I received. My pregnancy brain didn't kick in until after garbage day. Bummer. Looks like a lot of people have had the same issue with getting the wrong item as well. :-/,2
12x16 Toddler Pillow (Playful Monkey),I bought a regular size pillow- too big. Pillow Pets- too hot. This one is perfect size and filled just right for my 28 m.o. daughter. She loves it and so do I. It's cute too.,5
"OXO Tot Whale Pail, Blue","I love the white OXO whale pail, looks sleek compared to the blue one. The suction cups worked well for me, unlike other reviewers who could not get them to stick. Its really 2 peices, one side stays on the bath wall, while the other with the handle can be lifted off. Neat idea, but I think it will fall off easily. I don't know about other kids, but mine have aquired quite a few bath toys and hardly any will fit in this pail. I had to pick a few toys to put in it and store the rest  in a bath cabinet. So, the 4 star review is for the lack of space inside this whale pail. If your looking for something to hold alot of toys, this is NOT it. But, if you want something for a few toys, sleek, not tacky..then this is for you.",4
Kolcraft - Pediatric 800 Crib and Toddler Mattress,"I bought this mattress for my son when he moved into a toddler bed. I love the Kolcraft and can see it lasting a good while as well. Its nice and firm but still soft enough to be comfortable. I will say one word of caution though, not so much about the mattress itself but about the price. While I am writing this review, Amazon is selling it for $120. That is why it got a 3 star review. Otherwise it would get 5 stars! Walmart carries this mattress for $40! Save yourself a good amount of money and go elsewhere to purchase![...]",3
"Safety 1st Complete Air Protect 65 Convertible Car Seat, Great Lakes","Currently, the product features and product description contradict each other in regards to the weight limit of this car seat.  The seat holds a child up to 65lbs (thus the name, ""Air 65"").  The Air Protect only holds a child up to 50lbs.Anyway, onto my review.We are using this as a rear facing seat in our Chevy Malibu, and it fits just fine. Yes, it is a big car seat, but safety was my number one priority when upgrading to a toddler car seat, so I don't mind the bulk. I love that we can keep the seat rear facing up to 40 lbs, now that the AAP's new recommendation is to wait till age 2, this seat makes it easy to do so.I'm glad we had the Chicco Keyfit 30 when our guy was an infant. I'm sure this is safe enough, but I wouldn't want it as an infant seat . . . too inconvenient. Even though my son isn't quiet 1 yet, he was ready for a more toddler friendly seat. This delivers, he isn't leaning back as far and the sides don't cave in next to him. I could tell he liked having things a little roomier the moment I put him in this seat. He still falls asleep with ease.The cup holder isn't pictured, but there is a detachable one in the box. The material is easy to take off and machine wash when accidents happen.My hubby and Father-in-law set this up in about 7 minutes. If you are going to use it rear facing, you do need a rolled up towel or pool noodle underneath (this is clear in the instruction booklet).Overall, I'm very satisfied with my purchase.",5
"Kissaluvs Cotton Fleece Booster Doublers, 6 Pack, Unbleached",I love these boosters for when I just need a little extra in my son's cloth diaper.  It adds a lot absorbency without a lot of added bulk.  I would definitely get these again.,5
2-in-1 Professional Clinical RY210 Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead and Surface,"Take a good look at all of the ""positive"" reviews...they were all written by the same person. Notice the same general tone and lenght of each review. Notice they all are written by someone using a first name only. And the dead giveaway, notice the lack of a space between one or more of the sentences. Really? This may be a good product, but I won't buy it on general principle based on these fake reviews.UPDATE: I received this product to try and review it. While I wasn't thrilled with the fake reviews that were posted, I was interested in the product. As the father of four, young children a thermometer in our home is always well used. This product seemed great because the in-the-ear types and the swipe the forehead types require you to move and make contact with your child. That can be hard when they are cranky, sleeping or have (yet another) ear infection. The non-contact Infrared Thermometer worked well. The temperature readings can vary slightly, but when you follow the instructions it is accurate. For the price, this is a good product that works well. I'm sure that soon this is the technology that will be used for almost all thermometers and they will get even better.",4
"Vital Baby Baby's 1st Feeding Set, Pink",I purchased these spoons for my 4 1/2 old month.  They are fantastic.  I would definitely buy them again.,5
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black",I did not wanted to stick the plastic cup to my window..this is the best one according to me. Fits in window perfectly. Does the work.Has cling wrap like design on the back but much sturdier..leaves no mark when removed and you can put it back any number of times..It is the good reason why it is Ranked#1 i guess.,5
"Evenflo Chase LX Harnessed Booster Car Seat, Reese","Good car seat, the upholders fall out too easily but otherwise great.",4
Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker,My mom bought this for me over the holidays.  I was so excited to use it as I wanted to try making my own organic baby food at home.  Being a busy professional I never imagined it would be this easy.  I love the all in one concept.  The only thing I wasn't happy about was that it cost $150 but was made in China.  I would have preferred for it to be made in France as I'm sure it used to be a few years ago.  Another thing:  I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to secure the blade when I first opened it.  The instruction book wasn't very descriptive about it except for a small picture.  A phone call to the company finally resolved the issue.,5
"DaVinci Piedmont 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Espresso","I haven't used it for our baby yet since he hasn't arrived yet but my husband doesn't most of the afternoon assembling it. It was packed well but still arrived with some scratches here and there.It was a very time consuming project though the instructions were pretty good. As far as looks, it's beautiful ..no issue there..and it seems solid. We fit a Colgate Natural 1 well with a good amount of compression at the sides for safety sake.I'll update after we have used it a few months.",4
Leachco Prop 'R Shopper - Shopping Cart Cover - Sage Pin Dot,My 5 month old baby loves it! He is so cute & comfortable in it. I would highly recommend it.,5
"Nurtria Non-Slip Divided Warming Baby Plate, Blue","I filled this with hot tap water, water warmed in the micro and nothing kept my granddaughters food warm any longer than if I put it on a regular plate.  The removable rubber ring will be a good idea when she's old enough to feed herself.  I ended up removing the ring and putting the food in the plate and then micro for 25 sec.  This way I could keep warming it when it cooled.  Even preheating the baby food before putting it in the plate with the hot water didn't keep it any warmer than just warming the food in the plate to start with.  Any divided dish would work the same.",1
"Thermos Funtainer Food Jar, Littlest Pet Shop",Love this! my daughter is such a picky eater and this saves me a lot of frustration at lunch time! mac and cheese and spag o's still warm at lunch!  thanks!  shipping was quick!,5
Evenflo Bounce and Learn Bee Exersaucer,My son loves this! I wish it lit up or made noise that's why I gave it 4 stars. He does like it though- and it's very easy to put together. I'd recommend it to a friend.,4
Fisher-Price Disney Baby Simba's King-Sized Play Gym,"I bought this play gym for my 3 month old nephew and I absolutely LOVE it. It was one of the nicest play gyms that I have seen on Amazon. Also, it is good quality mat and very easy to assemble. My sister had bought another play gym from Amazon that was about $20.00 and it fell apart almost immediately. So, if I were you I would spend the extra money and buy this wonderful play gym. I would highly recommend this for your little one!",5
"Dr. Brown's Designed To Nourish 2 Pack Divided Plate, Colors May Vary","Really can't go wrong.  They are divided and work like they are supposed to.  I mean, what can you say about a plate?",5
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue",My 3 month old loves this jumper. The only problem is that his feet do not reach the floor but he is still able to bounce around in it. That's why I'm giving it four stars. He loves all the toys that come with it and that you can connect other toys to it. I have tried him in other jumpers and he did not care for them at all. I am glad that he is still able to bounce around in it without his feet reaching the floor.,4
"American Baby Company 100% Organic Cotton Interlock Fitted Pack N Play Sheet, Natural",These are very nice sheets that fit the Graco Pack-n-Play.  They are very soft and much nicer feeling than the standard sheets.  I bought 2 so that I could always have one washing and one on my baby's bed.,5
"Britax B-Ready Stroller, Black","We had the UppaBaby Vista (2012 model) for 14 months before it was stolen, and we purchased this stroller to replace it.  The strollers are extremely similar in their design and functionality.  And, at the time, the Britax B-Ready with bassinet was hundreds less than getting another UppaBaby Vista.Pros:The shocks are noticeably better.  I felt like our baby could feel every bump on the sidewalk with the Vista, and the B-Ready is much smoother.  The mechanism to fold up the stroller is so much easier.  I always struggled with folding up the Vista the whole 14 months we had it.  It actually comes with a cup holder.  It's prone to falling out if it gets knocked or while your folding it up like most plastic cup holder attachments.  (Sidenote:  The Britax Stroller Organizer is a great cup holder that doesn't fall off.)Cons:The Britax is a little heavier and wider than the Vista, which could be good or bad depending on where you live.  We live in the city, and I'm frequently folding up the stroller to carry up and down stairs.  It's also too wide to take on the bus, but, to be honest, the Vista wasn't easy to take on the bus either.Overall, I really prefer the Britax B-Ready and this it's a great stroller!  But, if you are comparing these two, they are so similar that the price you can get on them is probably the main factor!General stroller buying tip:You can get a big discount on the previous years' stroller model depending on when you purchase.  The manufacturers give big discounts to unload the old model before releasing the new model.  And, really, do stroller features change that much from year-to-year?  No.  We had the Vista in our wish list on Amazon while I was pregnant and waited on it, not realizing it was the older model.  Then when we went to purchase, we had to get the new model for $150 more because we waited.  Our friend got the older model, and they were hardly different.  Wish we had saved the money instead, so learn from our mistake and see if you can get a deal on an old model!  You can also save by getting a color other than the standard black or grey.",5
Terry Contoured Changing Pad Cover - White,"As far as the safety straps, it took me 2 seconds to realize that the straps are attached underneath and therfore there is NO need for the slits, I have the pink one on my changing table and the straps are fine and secure. I love this product, it dresses up baby's room and I intend on getting more.",5
"Pickles Nummy Animal Snuggly Banky, Ivory Lamb, 16 X 16&quot;","This is an adorable baby shower gift. It tops off a gift basket so nicely and it's such a cute idea. The blanket size is a little small, but it's perfect for traveling with and laying over your baby in a car seat. Great gift!",5
California Baby Eco Traveler Mixed Scent Gift Set,So I got this because it was my first introduction to California Baby.  I am SO HAPPY I DID!  I realized I did not like the Calendula line because the smell was too strong for me.  The Over tired and cranky line was a little too medicinal smelling to me too.  I liked the calming line and I love the Tee Tree and Lavender bodywash!  I ended up buying a bigger size of the for the whole family.  I also realized I like the Sensitive/unscented line for my new baby.  I loved that I got to try both sunscreens and the therapeutic diaper cream.  Great travel sizes too...not super small.  Great introduction to the line to find out what you like!!,5
"The Happy Closet Baby Closet Dividers, Blue and Green",I am a big organizer so I love having these in the nursery. Shipping was fast and easy: I received my product earlier than the latest estimated delivery date. I had no problems with the order and the product is exactly as pictured and described. The only thing I wish is that there were more clear labels in the package.,5
Fisher-Price My Little Snugabunny Newborn Rock n' Play Sleeper,"Liner gets moldy with use.  Can't resell.  Also, that means that your child breaths in mold spores if you use this.  And we cleaned ours frequently.",2
Pigeon Nail Scissor (New Born Baby) Made in Japan,"I know it's expensive, but this nail scissor makes up for its cost with peace of mind. I tried a ""baby"" nail clipper (actually a regular nail clipper encased in plastic) and ended up catching my daughter's skin. I despaired that I couldn't keep her nails short to protect her face. Then I finally purchased this scissor and discovered how easy it could be to do a safe, precision job. The blades are sharp but rounded and it's easy to avoid the skin and control the length of the nails. Highly, highly recommended!",5
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,"There is no comparison: These are the best blankets out there.Definitely buy THESE specific blankets (boutique, size 47x47) - they are much better quality and are bigger than the ones you buy in box stores.We have 6 of these, use them EVERY day, and I wish I had more!",5
"Kiddy Cruiserfix Pro Car Seat, Walnut",My 4 year old needed a booster seat and my wife's family in Germany told us about this great car seat. The seat comes with side impact protection and adjusts for his growth with the back rest and seat for his legs. We know that it is of the highest quality and that this will be the last car seat he will need.,5
Mommy's Helper Panda Door Pinch Guard,These door stops work very well.  They stop the door with enough space so that little baby fingers don't get caught.,5
"Blue Baby Boy-Instant Pop Up Mosquito Net Crib, Baby Tent, Beach Play Tent, Bed Playpen,","It was perfect for an infant, but flimsy. Not a substitute for a pack n play or tent... Okay for a newborn in the shade or inside... Not appropriate for movers, or in the sun.",4
"OXO Tot Straw Cup, Aqua, 11 Ounce",ordered 2 sizes in this cup.  haven't used these yet but they are light and I am sure like the other products I have ordered made by OXO I will be very happy,4
"The First Years Babypro Quick Serve Bottle Warmer, Colors May Vary","I bought this to take out the guess work and hassle of warming bottles, but it is not working for me. I try to set it so that I can turn it on, go change the baby then it would be ready. This method works occasionally but I get inconsistent results. Whenever the light turns off, the milk is still cold and I have to let it sit for another few minutes to finish warming. If I wait too long it's too hot, so I have to stand there and wait for it. Occasionally when I warm a bottle it somehow seems to boil the milk out if it. Don't know if the top of the bottle was loose or what but I'm finding it easier to just go back to sitting bottles in hot water from the tap. Very disappointed.",2
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst","This item was a good buy.  After reading all the reviews, I made the decision to try it out.  I am a breastfeeding mommy, and this pillow comes in handy.  It eases the strain of holding the baby while breastfeeding every couple of hours, and even helps him latch on easier.  My husband can even use the pillow when bottle feeding.  I would recommend.  Not a necessity, but definitely a helper!",5
"Cloud b Sound Machine Soother, Sleep Sheep",This was such a cutie that I bought two for the nephew and niece I was expecting...they were a hit and I would recommend the little sheep to anyone who is in need of a baby gift.,5
Lamaze Soft Chime Garden Musical Toy,When it arrived it was obviously opened and resealed.  Didn't make any noise or music at all.  I returned this item.,1
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","I had been using a Dr. Brown's bottle brush for my Dr. Browns bottles until it fell apart (just normal wear on the sponge).  This brush does a much better job of soaping and cleaning the inside of my Dr. Brown's bottles and I can squeeze the brush into a ton of different things!  The bristles are softer than the Dr. Browns brush so I get more soap suds and I feel as if it's more gentle on my bottles (not that it really matters that much).  Other reviewers are right about the nipple cleaner, I'm never going to use it, and it doesn't make much sense.  I wish instead of the nipple cleaner, there was a small pipe thingy like the small pipe cleaners that come with the Dr. Brown's bottles (for the blue tube).  The base is also much more stable than Dr. Browns.I'm so glad I decided to order this brush instead of getting another Dr. Browns.  I'm convinced that the reviewers of the Dr. Browns bottle brush haven't tried this one.  I didn't hate my other brush, but this one is just much better.  Glad I tried it!",5
We Sell Mats 36 Sq Ft Alphabet and Number Floor Mat,This mat  is great for a baby that is just learning to crawl or is sitting up. Its soft enough to not heart your baby in case he/she falls and hard enough for baby to be able to crawl and roll over easily.I highly recommend this mat.,5
Sunshine Kids Easy View Back Seat Mirror,"I really should have read the reviews before buying this mirror.... I actually tried to cancel this item but it had already shipped. Our mirror hasn't broken (yet) but it's pretty useless. It vibrants while you're driving so you cannot really see your kid. The vibrations cause the mirror to move so it's always out of place. Either way, it serves us no purpose. I'll be getting rid of it and going back to the other kind.",1
"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","My 2.5 year old daughter received this from the ""binky fairy"" as a subsitute for one of her two binkies that she required each night. It is SO SOFT and she absolutely adores her ""Monkey""...I had to order a second one to make sure she always had a clean one available. It really helped to wean her off the binky -- once she was used to using her monkey & just one binky, then we were able to wean her off the other pacifier too.",5
rooCASE EVA Hard Shell (Black) Carrying Case with Memory Foam for Nikon Coolpix Digital Camera S3300 S4300 S6300 S9300 L26 P310,"I have a problem with my camera, I have noticed the flash comes out automatically, but when I turn off the camera it wont close unless I push it back. I need to know what is the step to be taken for replacement on this unit...other than this it is a great piece!",2
Maya Wrap Lightly Padded Baby Sling-Medium-Bright Stripe,"Bought this because it was recommended by experienced baby wearers. Very comfortable and baby really enjoys it (6 month old). I use it when I'm doing chores around the house, when I'm grocery shopping and when we go for walks. My stroller is now collecting dust. :) glad that product included instructional DVD because it helped me fold the wrap in a way which makes adjusting easy for putting baby in and taking baby out.",5
Summer Infant Little Looster,Got this for my 5 year old son who made us hold him while he was sitting on the potty. I originally bought this with plans to buy a form of handle for him to hang on to. This stool gave him a great place to steady/place his feet and we didn't need to purchase anything else. Great item!!,5
"Tommee Tippee Deco Starter Set, Girl","If you don't like advent bottles you probably won't like tommee tippee either. I was looking for a slow flow nipple and both advent and this bottle claim to be slow flow but are not! Far from slow, my baby wore half her bottle on her face. Giving it a three its not a terrible bottle if your looking for something with faster flow nipple.",3
Nuby Electric Flex Breast Pump,This is a very nice quality pump with the capability of electric or manual pumping.  This is going to be very useful.,5
Professional Clinical Large LCD Non-contact Infrared Thermometer - Forehead (Fahrenheit Readings),"I am disappointed.  I have the flu and didn't want to drive to the store to pick up a thermometer so came to Amazon (like I do most of my shopping).  Chose this one.  I knew I would have to wait a few days before taking my temperature by ordering here but it was worth the effort of me trying to drag myself to the store.  It arrived today and I tried EVERYTHING to turn it on.  Even putting in new batteries, changing the batteries directions, pushing every button I could find since the booklet directions weren't clear on what button actually turns it on.  It stayed dead no matter what I did.  Packed it back up to get returned and will have a friend pick up a thermometer from a local store.",1
Boppy Prenatal Total Body Pillow,Wife was complaining daily how she can't get comfortable when she sleeps anymore.  She only slept in her back or stomach.  Now pregnant she can't. We took a shot at this pillow and she hasn't complained since.  I haven't asked. But the complaint have stopped.  And it's been 3 months.  Baby due in 3 more months. And she has used for 3 months now.  So Ill rate this product as good being I don't hear I can't sleep good anymore.  Lol.,5
"Trend Lab Fleece CribWrap Rail Covers for Crib Sides (Set of 2), Pink, Wide","Soft, easy to put on the crib. Washable which is necessary. Helps prevent my son from chewing on crib rails.",4
"Munchkin Snack Dispenser, Colors May Vary",Giving it 5 starts for the price. The only knock I have on the product it that the picture looks like you'd be able to rotate the cap to the different sections. But there is a plastic ridge that prevents full rotation. Removed easily enough with a straight razor.,5
Ingenuity Portable Swing - Bella Vista,"This swing is great! It was super easy to assemble.  It has just the right amount of swinging power behind it and as an added touch, the music it plays is very pleasant.  I can easily move it from room to room without breaking my back or a doorway.  And my little guy enjoys this swing while Mommy gets a much needed shower.",5
"Munchkin 2 Piece SpongeBob SquarePants Insulated Sippy Cup, Colors May Vary, 9 Ounce",I have used alot of sippy cups with my kids. I have always been looking for a cup that doesn't leak but is easy to drink from for the child also. I bought these and saw that they had a leak proof garuntee. My kids were so excited to try them becuase they love spongebob. But when my daughter first used the cup it leaked all the way down her shirt. I emailed the company and they sent me replacement cups free of charge. I must have just gotten a bad cup because the new ones don't leak at all. I will be buying more cups by munchkin with other characters on them. They are the best cup I have used yet.,5
"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Camel","I purchased the Ergo because my 17 lbs daughter was getting too heavy for the Moby (preferred by me) or the Bjorn (preferred by my husband).  I have a Snugli back carrier, but this made my neck and shoulders ache.  I looked on youtube for some moby backholds and even tried a few but they seemed cumbersome to tie and dangerous to slide the baby into.  I've been stalking the ergo for a while, reading all the horror stories of copycat ergos, watching craigslist and ebay and staring with adoration at the $115.00 Target ones.  Finally, one night the amazon ergo went on sale so I cashed in my visa points with the sale and took advantage of the free shipping and purchased the ergo cheaper than I had found on craigslist.  It shipped quickly and after a bullet point inspection proved I had the real deal, we put it on.  Like the title of this review says, mama and baby love this as a back carrier.  The weight sits on my lower back which makes it comfortable for me and baby sits in the carrier so she isn't giving herself a front wedgie.  I use this for the afternoon witching hour to make dinner and get chores done.  I've gotten brave enough to put this on in the grocery store parking lot and shopping at the mall.  Baby loves throwing her weight side to side and the extra room she has to move.  The adjusts easily and my husband wears her too.  Looking forward to giving this thing a lot of use!",5
Pinky Teddy Bear by Bearington Bear,I wanted a little bigest than the original... It was a present for my grant nice and she wanted to hug her bear and this is to small...,3
Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"This is the best investment anyone who has an infant could make.  My son is 11 months old, and has used this since he is about 7 months old, and he absolutely loves it!  He jumps his little heart out, and it keeps him very content and occupied for a good amount of time!  He laughs and screams and yells and sings the whole time!  I would recommend the Jumperoo to everyone!",5
Sesame Street Alphabet Foam Floor Puzzle,"Nice foam puzzle. We use it to make blocks with it instead since it's not a large peice for the floor. It was sort of misleading when I brought this thinking that it can be used as a playmat. It really is small that you can't really sit on it. Better use it as building block and if for a puzzle, not really worth it.",3
"Manual Woodworkers Cotton Baby Quilt, This Little House, 30 X 40&quot;","When I saw the pic for it on amazon, it looked really nice and would be perfect for a portable crib. After reading about the company on their website, I thought I was getting a quality US made product but upon receiving it, it was nothing more than yet another made in china product.  Super cheap looking and very thin, like a bedspread from motel 6. If I saw it in a store, I wouldn't even pay $10 for it.",2
"Summer Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Pink Bunnies","These little pink bunnies are perfect for protecting little necks from car seat straps!  My daughter loves her pink bunnies!  Better yet, they are machine washable!  They are super soft and also prop up a sleepy baby head when they decide to take a nap on a long car ride. Definitely recommend these!",5
"My Brest Friend Pillow, Sunburst",Great back support and placement for baby. I ended up just side-lying mostly but would reccommend this if you can't or dont want to side-lie in the early days,4
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner Portable Placemat, Pink",The actual color is much darker than the pic. My daughter did not like it at all as she wants a PINK one.,1
Thudguard Baby Safety Helmet - Blue,"I would have rated the helmet with 5 stars, but my little guy perspires quite a bit and that makes it uncomfortable for him. Still, I'm glad I bought it and I'll keep using it (but for short periods of time).",4
"Bumkins Reusable Sandwich and Snack Bag, Bright Blue, Large","Who says I can't take a Dr.Seuss bag with me on the trails?  This bag is just big enough for a regular sandwich or a small portion of trail mix.  I like my whole wheat, Swiss cheese sandwiches and this bag is perfect for that.  It's also ideal for an office or school lunch bag.  It configures well to the carrier it is in.It can be turned inside out for quick wipe-downs and drying.  A zipper keeps the odor to a minimum.  The material is strong enough to last for many uses.  Another thing I like is that the material doesn't smell nor carry an odor over to the food.",5
"Graco Blossom 4-In-1 Seating System, Sapphire","Easy to use, and fairly easy to assemble.  Adjustable in many different ways...all useful.  &#34;4 in 1 seating system&#34; is accurate.",5
CoCaLo Harlow Boudoir Pillow,"This is a beautiful pillow with fabulous detail that goes great with my nursery decor. it was smaller than I though it was going to be is my only complaint, but that is my fault for not reading the dimensions before I ordered it. Love love love this set!",4
Graco Digital Deluxe Video iMonitor Baby Monitor,"After reading some of the POSITIVE reviews of this product, I bought this monitor. BIG MISTAKE! The picture quality is very blurry during the day and night and the screen is not in full color during the day like the box shows. It is a very poor image. Sometimes I can't tell if my baby is turning his head or if the image is just blurring at that moment.This unit claims to be able to have a 600FT range. I have a 3,600 sq ft house so I figured I could at least go down stairs and have the ability to see my baby. NOPE! The monitor is constantly searching for the image and it has a tiling effect when it does this. I even put the monitor in my room which is less than 50ft from my baby's room and it still has a tiling effect while the monitor is on. Things like microwaves, computers, cell phones and cordless phones interfere with the picture on my monitor. I sent back this unit to Graco thinking mine was defective and when I got the brand new one a few days ago, I had the same problems!!The positive reviews I saw on Amazon prior to my purchase of this product were probably written by someone who worked for Graco or owned some of their stock.I would buy another product besides this one if you are in the market for a video monitor.",1
"Inglesina Club Highchair, Graphite","I bought this high chair for my grandson to use at my house. He outgrew it after about 2 1/2 months of use. Would probably work OK for a smaller baby- my grandson is off-the-growth-chart tall for his age.ProsLooks nice if you like Euro stylingEasy to assembleLightweight- easy to pick up and moveSeat pad launders great and appears comfyConsTray difficult to get on and off- I couldn't manage that with one hand while holding babySafety strap stitching separated on crotch strap after a few uses. However, customer service was very helpful and promptly sent replacements for all strapsChair seemed unstable/tippy when baby got rambunctious and threw his weight around!Chair pad easily slides off the seatback when baby is in chairThis isn't a ""bad"" high chair, but I'd return it if I could. It didn't work for me, or my grandson.",2
"Combi 3 in 1 Hero High Chair, Wasabi","We bought this highchair for our first child based on look (not too girl or boy) and price (mid-level).  It appeared to do all the right functions and was great while our little one was little.  Once she started to grow we realized a lot of our mistakes.  The apple set-in plate became an annoyance since she could remove it and when it was not there and the raised edges where it goes limits the plate size, toys, and coloring you can do in the highchair (my husband built a tray to go over the apple so she could color in the chair).  My husband has also taken both the tray and the chair apart to fix the interior latch mechanisms, as they have both broke from use (and we don't use it that much).  As others mentioned, the strap clips are so tight that you can really pinch your fingers if not careful and the grandma's find it too difficult to use with arthritis.  I would have given the chair a 1 star, but I guess since we have lived with it for 2 years now, I will give it 2 stars.  The chair recline broke again today and that is it, I am excited to get a new one.  And this time I am doing my research!",2
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Dee Dee the Dragon","I absolutely adore the Lamaze toys!  Dee Dee is the fourth or fifth in Lamaze toy in our collection and she's just as sweet as the others.  Our two month old is at the point where she's looking but not yet really touching toys, but the colorful Lamaze toys seem to catch her attention.  I can't wait until she is able to discover all the different sounds and textures on her own!",5
Koala Baby 4 Pack Receiving Blankets - Boy Assortment,"These blankets are WONDERFUL!  ESPECIALLY if you want to swaddle your baby.  The blankets are rectangle instead of square, this helps to keep the ends tucked in.  I still use them to tuck in my toddler, the large size continues to come in very handy.",5

Disney Princess ~ Baby Girl Memory Book ~ &quot;Our Little Princess&quot; Pink,"This is a pretty little baby book!  There's room for pictures, firsts, etc. and it's got a lot of detailed areas for baby's &#34;firsts&#34;.  The only thing I don't like is that the binding is on the smaller side.  So it's not going to fit the baby's first birthday or holiday cards.  It would be nice to have extra space or a way to add pages but for the price, it's a very pretty book.  I really like it!",4
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,These are great -- so far :D.  The adhesive is strong and the mechanism sturdy. No little one is getting in my fridge or cupboard again :D,5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"My son is using this potty chair for two months already. He love it! The sit is comfortable and provides support. Depends how big is your child, she or he may need some support if they are not able to sit alone. It is easy to clean. This product has good quality.",5
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,"Babies love music and this worm is so cute and much larger than I thought, which is a good thing!!",5
Potty Pee Wee - Boy Potty Training Doll,"UPDATE: I wanted to update my previous posting. It has now been about two weeks since starting potty training with this product and my son is fully potty trained! One accident in the last week. We only had to use the doll twice and my son was excited to potty train. It was easy!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------My son is two years and seven months old and has shown no interest in potty training. I understand the importance of not forcing a child who is not emotionally ready however, in  eight months if he is not potty trained, he will not be able to join a Montessori preschool with his sister until the next school year when he is four. A week ago, this situation encouraged me to find ways to make him interested on his own. I read several articles and combined all of the ideas I thought were the best.I bought him underwear (big boy pants) with animal characters he liked.I printed out a free potty sticker chart and bought star stickers for when he used the potty successfully. When he fills it out, he will get a small toy.I bought jelly beans for successful use of the potty.I bought a couple of child potty books that told stories he could relate with (My Big Boy Potty by: Joanna Cole) (Potty by: Leslie Patricelli)I bought this Potty Pee Wee Doll.We named this doll Sammy and my son taught him how to use the potty. We pointed out his body parts and the water bottle inside has a nipple-like piece we said that is where the pee-pee comes out. Then I said I think Sammy needs to go potty and my son sat him on the potty. The pee comes out when you squeeze its belly.  Beware it leaks but the doll is washable and its not like you keep him full of water all the time. Over all, I think all of these products played an important part and my son is now interested in and successfully potty training. Four days ago, he refused to sit on the potty or wear underwear. Now, he is making two ""pee-pees"" in the potty daily because he wants to. I do not pressure him. He still has accidents as expected but I am rating this product on its ability to help my son to become interested in using the potty. It worked and we will continue to use these techniques.",4
Philips AVENT Express Food and Bottle Warmer,"it is good, though its not what i thought. i expected it to  cut automatically in order not to overheat the bottle, but it doesnt work like  that. my fault i didnt get to know well about its working before buying.",2
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"I got this for my daughter who was 5 months old at the time. She loves to jump in it. She likes all the little attachments that she can grab onto, especially the bird and frog that hang overhead. She likes it with or without music.The only negative about the product would be that it does take up a fair amount of room. We have it in a large room, so it's not something that bothers me specifically, however if you have a small space you might want to take that into consideration.",5
Piyo Piyo Yellow Baby Nail Scissors,Work very well for little tiny baby fingers. I feel confident using them on my baby from when he was one month old and up.,5
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue","Baby Einstein jumper was useful. Combines teaching little ones how to hold up their own weight, helps to strengthen their legs with the bouncing motion, while entertaining them at the same time. We liked it. Putting it away was a little bit of a pain but once you learn how to fold it, no big deal after that.",4
Munchkin Cleaning Brush Set,"These brushes are very small, I wanted to replace a small brush I use to clean inside the motor of our Drinkwell pet fountain. These were way too small.",3
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"I used this gym for my first child without incident, and he loved it. However, when my second son was 4 months old he gagged on one of the pieces. I laid him on his back to play and moments later heard him gagging. The blue spinning part of the parrot hanging toy was completely inside his mouth and he couldn't turn his head. Luckily nothing serious happened, but I wanted other parents to be aware of this potential problem. Fisher-Price is a very nice company to deal with. I sent the toy back and received a voucher.",3
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White","I can never get this to fit on my Pack N Play correctly. It seems too narrow - the waterproof area does not cover the entire sleeping surface. I haven't had trouble with it coming off or leaking, so functionally it is okay, but it gives a sort of lumpy appearance to the sleeping surface.",3
KidCo Convertible Crib Bed Rail Finish: Natural,I looked for weeks for a crib converter kit but kept finding they were super expensive. I wasn't about to spend $150 or more to concert my sons crib. Eventually I found this one and was shocked at all the great reviews and the price. Its true that it comes unfinished so you can paint it whatever color you want.  The instructions can be a little difficult and they should invest in re-writing them and placing identifying stickers on the pieces but otherwise with a little trial and error we figured it out and my son LOVES it. Its sturdy and safe when installed properly. Best converter for the price.,5
Milkies Milk-Saver Breast Milk Collector Storage BPA Free,Millie's are THE BEST! They have save so much of my milk that would have gone into a nursing pad otherwise! Sometimes I even get close to 2 ounces in one feeding! I have stashed away a good amount of milk in my freezer now! Thanks milkies!,5
Nightstar Contour Changing Pad,"I bought this pas when I was pregnant and thought it was very well made.  My baby is now 6 months old and the pad is indeed great, well made and still look brand new.  Cleans very easily since it's waterproof and the price is right. Would buy it again.",5
"Evenflo COuncey 3 Pack Glass Bottle with Sleeve, 8 Ounce, Colors May Vary","I use these bottles to send expressed milk into daycare for my son.  I had looked at some of the other brands for glass bottles (we had been previous Dr. Browns users) but the pricing was prohibitive.  My son doesn't seem to have any issues with excess air consumption using these bottles and they're priced so much better!  I love the silicone wraps - although I'd suggest taking them off for washing.  Once you get used to putting them on and off they're not a hassle.  We've also dropped these bottles a couple times while washing, and none have broken - so a thick borosilicate glass bottle apparently is real tough!",5
New Mommy Advice Cards -24ct- Party Supplies,These cards were very sweet. I hope that my daughter always keeps them for the wonderful advice her loved ones gave her!,5
Cotton Tale Designs Pirates Cove Musical Mobile,Mobil is very beautiful fast shipping I am very pleased with my order A+ definitely completes the look it is a must,5
Econobum Full Kit,"The inserts fluffed up so much after the recommended 5 washes. I can't say how well the system works, but I got them for a gift for my sis. Once the baby fits into them, and she starts using them, I will update my review. Being a former recent cloth diaper user, I would say that I would definitely have used these. I used some not so great diapers and made them work, but I feel these would have fit the bill for affordable and meeting/exceeding my expectations. For the price and the way the inserts fluffed up, I would definitely recommend these to friends.",5
Sassy Baby's First Toys,"I would call this box of toys mediocre here's the good and the bad.Good:1. My son's favorite toys came from this box.  Even now at 7 months, he loves the teething bird, the rattle and the pig that came instead of the ducky.2. Thank goodness for the letters! Not only were they fun-textured, but we used them to hang the toys on his play gym lower.3. Several of the toys have been pretty well abused and show no signs of wear.4.It's a nice variety of easy-to-throw-in-the-diaper-bag toys - small enough he can carry them with him into the carseat.Bad:1. Definitely did not get all the toys in the picture, no ducks, no octopus, and didn't get the thing in the picture with what looks like 3 stuffed cubes.  We did get a stuffed pig on wheels that is not in the picture, and one rattle instead of one of the ones in the picture, but it's definitely less overall.2. The letters came in handy, but really aren't fun toys.It's probably not worth $39.99 - I got it as a gift and would say it's worth $19.99 - so maybe pick it up if you can find in on sale.",3
"Graco LiteRider Stroller, Lively Dots","It works very well with graco infant car seat. it protect my kid from wind, rain and sun. We also light the light weight. we have it for 20 months and put about 100 miles on it but still works great. it's made of plastic though.",5
"Kiddopotamus Tinydiner Placemat, Yellow","I was unsure about spending so much money on a placemat for eating out.  But I must say, after using it a few times, it is FANTASTIC!  I can pull it out of the diaper bag and stick it right to the table.  There is a place to catch all the food that falls, and clean up is a cinch.  It rolls up and folds into itself for easy storage.  A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAMILY THAT EATS OUT!",5
"Joovy Caboose Too Ultralight Stroller, Black","This stroller is perfect for my 4 month year old and 2 &1/2 year old. It feels like a single stroller (sometimes people I walk by laugh when they realize I have two in there because you can't tell because the stroller is non bulky) but has the back area for when my toddler doesn't want to walk or wants to ride on the platform. It handles great, great sun protection, easy to put together (and I'm terrible at putting things together and I could do it), and I love that its so narrow. I really REALLY love this product.",5
Munchkin Bath Super Scooper Turtle,"This is such a great solution for storing bath toys and letting them drip dry without taking up too  much space. Other reviewers complained about the adhesive strip... we never had any problems for the 1.5 years we used it. More that we couldn't get it off easily when we moved (not complaining!). It's now hung up with a few Command strips, which also work.It's nice that we can tell our sons to clean up after themselves in the tub, and it's no big deal. The turtle &#34;chomp-chomp-chomp's&#34; and all picked up. Plus it's compact and cute looking.Worth the purchase. If somehow it broke (which two boys under 4 haven't done yet) I'd buy another in a heartbeat.",5
"Britax Boulevard 70 Convertible Car Seat, Silver Birch",I love this car seat.  My daughter is now three years old and it is taking a licking and still ticking or protecting more importantly.  The only issue is that it was too big to fit in my 2002 Hyundai Sonata :-(  so it stays in my husbands car...and I'm the one who loves zebra print...Oh well.,5
"The First Years Deluxe Reclining Feeding Seat, Dots",I like this high chair. I got it for my 6 month old son and it seems to work great! I have no complaints!!!,4
"Protect-a-Bub Single Compact Sunshade, Black","I use this everyday for my baby's Maclaren Quest.  It works pretty well.  It's easy to put on and off, and most of the time you can just keep it on when folding the stroller too.",5

Samsung Wireless Video Security Monitoring System,"Incredibly this item worked perfectly for about an hour and then started making interference, even when the monitor and the camera were next to each other.I checked with Samsung tech department and they told me to return it...",2
"Kidz Delight Smooth Touch Tablet, Fun N Play",Not worth the money. Definitely not a &#34;tablet&#34;. It's a pad with buttons. Very limited entertainment for toddlers. I normally do extensive research before I buy anything online but bought this in a rush for my son. What a disappointment. I wish I had done more research. My fault.,2
Baby Trend Expedition ELX Travel System Stroller - Everglade,"We live in downtown Boston so we wanted a stroller that can handle city living that includes cobblestone sidewalks and lots of potholes when crossing the street.  I have to say I'm pretty disappointed so far with the stroller.  Our baby is only 3 weeks old so I'm willing to give it a few more weeks but if I can't fix the problems I'm returning this.Pros:This stroller definitely passes the looks test which is why I bought it in the first place (plus it came highly recommended by the sales woman at Babie's 'R' Us.Love the storage compartment underneath.  Super convenient.Cons:The much discussed front wheel.  The manual says to tighten the nut on the front wheel.  We've done that 3 times already and after 1 use it loosens right up.  When the front wheel is too loose it wobbles like no other, especially when you on bumpy sidewalk terrain.  The wobble is pretty violent as well...(see below youtube video from another user.)  Somebody suggested replacing the washer with a 5/8"" neoprene washer.[...]The seatbelt straps are not the easiest to use.  You actually have to overlay the 2 sides before clasping the seatbelt in which is a royal pain in the butt.It's extremely bulky but I can't complain too much about that since i assume all the joggers are like this.I'm pretty sure there are better strollers out there....",2
"Fisher-Price Cradle 'N Swing,  My Little Snugabunny","as described and good build quality.  assembly took about 15 mins.  1 person can assemble, but 2 people will make it easier and faster.",5
Personalized Baby Blanket,I adore this blanket and my friend's new baby does too!  It's so soft and kept him company in his 6 week stay in the NICU.  All the nurses commented on how soft and cute the blanket was.  The shop seller was also very pleasant to work with.,5
Medela Starter Supplemental Nursing System (SNS) Sterile M#00902 without 80ml Bottle,I had numerous problems nursing my son. This feeder helped us both tremendously! I actually used it even after all of our nursing problems subsided. It helped with supplementing in order for us both to sleep a little longer at night when he was a month old.I have recommended it to many moms that have had nursing problems or in need of something to help supplement without using a bottle.,5
"Badger Basket Covered Convertible Cedar Sandbox with Two Bench Seats, Natural","Just like 80% of the previous reviews, I strongly suggest that you replace all 12 hinges with new, thicker hinges.  Otherwise, this sandbox was super easy to put together.  There is no bottom in this sandbox so I made sure to put down landscape fabric to prevent weeds from growing up in the sand.  In doing so, when it rains the water will flow through the sand into the ground.",4
"Kiddopotamus Cushystraps Super Soft Strap Covers, Blue Kitties",This works like it's supposed to and wraps aroundthe straps so my baby doesn't have to have saftey belt marks on his tender neck.  Nice & cushy.,4
"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Green","Our son first HATED this thing. We put him in his aunts excersaucer, and he loved that. The problem was at the 3-4 month stage, the bouncer was too big in the seat and he wobbled too much. The bouncer springs made him feel unstable and insecure.BUT.. after about 4 months he took a liking to it. At first I forgot to install the wheels to help the seat turn, so he hated it. I had put them aside thinking i will do it later (busy dad, ran out of time), forgot. Moved. Wife came by with a ""what are these??"" .. installed them instantly, put him in, and he could now easily turn.He absolutely loves it. He will play by himself in it, or interacting with us for 30 minutes to an hour. He gets so crazy with the jumping on this thing. He is now 6 months and still loves it. He sounds like hes running when hes jumping (alternating feet like hes working out). He loves the toys, especially when we hang up his favorite toys.Now.. on to the downsides of this:1: 1 of the piano keys is broken or sticks and cant be pressed by an infant.. which is a bummer, its the Blue key, and it seems blue and green have the LEAST annoying songs. Whereas red (the most often pressed on) has the most annoying :)2: the toy plate had 1 toy (the green clacking turn thing) that is just too hard for a little one to spin. Our niece commented on how it was stuck, and shes 4.3) the Sun is too hard. Too many times he pulls the sun forward to chew on, then bounces and hits himself in the eye. Next time I see, it, its coming off4) Seat is large, and leg holes are spread apart. Sometimes hard to get the child in (especially when theyre grabbing at toys while you struggle with their kicking and excited feet).Positives:1) Its heavy and large. I have caught myself using it as a footrest, and it doesnt even look like its under load. I bet this frame could support 100 lbs. I wouldnt try it, but good to know it can grow with a 30lb baby.2) Extremely adjustable - aside from the seat - you can move it up on 5 settings. Better than some of the other brands with only 3 or so settings. Plus unlike some excersaucers, the springs adjust with height. Meaning, if youre on 1, the springs are loose. So a lighter/smaller child can enjoy it. If youre on 5, the springs are more tight, so a larger child gets same enjoyment out of it. Unlike others where theres merely a height setting, but 1 weight setting.3) Numerous spots to hang toys. You can get the little rings and hang your childs favorite toys. And then alternate them to keep it fun and exciting.4) the frog toy/mirror combo is great. He loves to use this as a handlebar and get some air, and then peek at himself in the mirror.5) music is not overly loud, and actually has long versions of classical songs. A few i love, and its a treat when he plays them ;) There are 8 different songs, with 3 versions of each song in different tones. Plus theres a piano mode, however usually the blue key seems to not respond as easy as it should..6) Small details like beveled/raised images. As your baby starts to be able to discover things like that, the small things like that will help bring a new developmental stage. Now our son likes to play with the little einstein beveled logo and studies how it feels on his fingers.7) Great livingroom clothesline for trying off burp cloths and bibs :)...It does fold up, but its solid and massive. It does look like something that is built to last for a few children. Our little man absolutely loves it, but remember, they will hate it while they get used to the lack of stability (and it wiggles). Stick with it, few minutes here and there. Then sooner or later you with here the pitter patter of them jumping.Richard Simmons would be proud at the amount of workout they get with this.and yes, had eveyrthing worked, it wouldve got 4 stars. Regardless, I would buy this for anyone i know even if i knew there would be a few bugs with the toys.",4
Child Airplane Travel Harness - Cares Safety Restraint System - The Only FAA Approved Child Flying Safety Device,Did not have any problem with installation.Easy to use and kept my two years old boy safe in place the entire time.He even slept the whole time even tough he had the restrain on.Passengers behind us never complained. I would definitely recommend it to everyoneTraveling with toddlers/infants.,5

Medela Compatible Breast Pump Tubing - Tender Tubes ( 2 Packs in one package) - For Pump in Style Original and Advanced Breast Pump - BPA Free,The tubing is exactly the same as what's sold by Medela and it fits my Pump in Style Advanced perfectly. It is a set of two in plastic packaging as pictured. Does the job!,5
Munchkin White Hot Inflatable Duck Tub,"This duck is perfect for our daughter. It has grooves in the bottom to prevent falling, it has suction cups to stick to the tub (if you want), and you don't have to fill the whole tub. You save water by using this. She weighs about 17 lbs and still has room to use this.",5

SoftShells Breast Shell Soothers - Sore Nipples,"These shells gave me instant relief from sore nipples associated with breastfeeding. However, know that breast shells can increase milk production (ask your lactation consultant or doctor, or just Google it). This may be fine or even welcomed for some mothers, but for me, it was an undesired side effect. Still, because they worked so well, I'd definitely use them again!",5
Evenflo Bounce and Learn Bee Exersaucer,I got this for my three month old and he loves it! There are lots of toys to play though he has not noticed them all yet. He can also touch the bottom of it with his feet on the lowest setting. It was easy to put together and came three days earlier then expected!,5
"ERGObaby Teething Pads, Cream",These do exactly what they're supposed to do and my baby loves to gum and gnaw them. They are little drool-covered pads and they're great because I can wash them and not the whole carrier. I also don't get wet when he drools all over them like I do when he gnaws on the actual carrier. I wish they came in more colors.,5
Basic Comfort Rest EZ II Pregnancy Wedge,"By the time I actually purchased this, around my eighth month, I was already used to sleeping on my side.  The problems I was having of basic discomfort and pain when sleeping were not helped by this product.  If I wanted to move at all I had to wrestle with it to move it and I still hurt all the time.  I guess by that point nothing would have helped.  It might be useful if you buy it very early on, though.",2
New Boba Wrap in Red with Matching Carrying Pouch : Infant Baby Carrier : Preemie - 18months (Previously Sleepy Wrap),I like the product- just feel too short for it at 5'2. Fabric length is also intimidating. Maybe not super suited for petites?,3
JJ Cole Essentials Blanket Sky/Lemon,"This blanket is worth getting. It doesn't absorb water easily which makes it convenient for when the grass is wet or humid and it folds nicely into a compact rectangle, making it easy to keep in your car. It is easy to clean too as the grass and mud doesn't stick to it. Just remember 5ft x 5ft is much more small than you would think. I wish I had gotten a bigger one.",4
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium","Normally we love these swaddlers-- I don't think my son could sleep with out them!  But this is now the second green one we've had (the first was in a smaller size) that was way too stretchy.  I have absolutely no idea why the color should matter, but we've had no problems with the blue fleece ones we got or the printed cotton ones.  These green fleece ones are so stretchy that it's impossible to get them tight enough around my son.  He can always manage to wiggle his arms up and out, which then wakes him up.  So, it's a great product overall, but something about the sage green ones just doesn't work!",2
"NUK Gerber GraduatesAdvance Hard Spout Sippy Cups, Boy, 10 Ounce, 4-Count",Love these ones. These gerber Nuk ones did not crack inside where the stopper goes like others I have purchased. They're also super cute.,5
"Tadpoles One Bulb Shaded Chandelier, Pink","I absolutely love the lamp, but was very disappointed with how unbalanced it is once installed.  I have several chandeliers in my home, and my husband is very handy.  Unfortunately, this one must be defective, because the whole lamp hangs to one side.  It was what I was looking for, but it's completely out of center.",5
Em's 4 Kids Hearing Protection Earmuffs Noise Protection (Silver),These are great.  Both my son's ages 4 and 2.5 use them all the time.We even took them to the movies for the first time and brought them along because it is so loud and they were happy and comfortable.Would recommend them to anyone.,5
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","I havent used yet because my son has mostly all his teeth! We ordered this for our unborn child...due in June, it looked interesting.. Its cute and looks like it will help. My son tried to open it and i guess eat it!",5
"Kissaluvs Diaper Lotion Potion 4 oz, Spray","I may be biased and/or uninformed as this is the only diaper spray that I have ever used, but I love it! In fact, my child does too. It smells great and really gets the stinkies off your baby's bum. Great product and I would definitely recommend it!",5
"My Brest Friend Adjustable Nursing Stool, Wood","This stool gets the job done, the grip strips keep your feet from slipping off and the adjustable angle is a nice feature. Only two complaints is ours didn't come with assembly instructions and that it would be even better if the height could adjust for different height furniture. Otherwise a solidly made product that works as it should.",4
"DaVinci Highland 4-In-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Chestnut with Natural","We purchased the Davinci Highland Crib/Dresser combo pieces separately from other websites where I found a better deal. I had a hard time finding many customer reviews for this set. I am not sure if it's too new or just not popular. It does seem to be a higher price point than a lot of the Davinci sets so maybe that it why. I find the set to be very good quality for the price, and very appealing.  From my search to find the perfect set for my baby, I learned that modern design seems to come with a higher price tag, regardless of quality. I liked the Babyletto line, but I really wanted a set that would grow with our daughter longer by getting a four in one crib.The Davinci Highland was the best I could find based on price, quality, and style. It took my husband maybe an hour to assemble. It feels very sound and sturdy. The main parts of the crib are stained a walnut color. The spokes of the crib are a much lighter pine color. The contrast is very stunning and unique in person.We purchased the conversion rails from Amazon right away as I have learned from research that many manufacturers discontinue them or offer them sporadically, and then you are stuck with a convertible crib you cannot convert! I think this will make a very attractive full size bed when the time comes.One drawback that I have noticed is that some of the bolts to the crib are visible -I know this is a common feature of lower priced cribs, but I feel this crib is in the moderate price range and they could have tried harder to conceal them. But, it's not a deal breaker.When we purchased the crib, we got a Davinci Twilight mattress for free, so I cannot speak to how well other brand mattresses might fit.I also wanted to note that, although we purchased the pieces separately, they are the exact same color, We did not have a problem with the stain being off or different since we purchased from two different retailers. I have seen others mention that they had problems getting pieces that match from the same retailer, so I thought this was a nice perk worth mentioning.",4
Winnie The Pooh - Peek a Pooh Wall Border,"My wife and I purchased this border to go with the rest of the nursery....We love the design, however, as with the other reviewer, the border did not stick to the walls at all...We followed the directions to a ""T"" and an hour later, it fell off the wall in a crinkled mess....We were able to put it back up with wallpaper adhesive, but it was quite a hassle.  You would think that at fifteen dollars a strip, the self adhesive would be a little more reliable.....",2
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small","We own the newborn swaddling type, the cotton and the microfleece and love them all.  Very much like not having to bundle baby in blankets they can kick or wiggle out of!  We keep our home cool (62-65) year-round and these help keep babies comfy and safe all night long.  One of our new mommy diaper bags with all the promo stuff in it had one of these in a microfleece style!  From newborn thru crawling, these are great and now they make them with feet for older kids.  Kudos Halo!!  We tell everyone about these and give them as baby shower gifts.  Have seen other brands but we've stuck with Halo as they've held up through multiple washings w/o fail!!  Baby #2 is wearing baby #1's Halo's and they are still going strong and will be donated to a Goodwill as they still look that good!",5
Nuby Garden Fresh Fruitsicles,grandson really loved this and easy too use easy for young toddlers,5
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","We bought this gate so that our dogs cannot access the upstairs which is carpeted. All other &#34;baby gates&#34; that we have tried from Walmart and other stores where insufficient. The dogs could just jump right over them. Also, the kids would get tripped up on the gate and they were not able to secure the gate between the walls with enough tension so if an adult did not do it, it would just flop around and end up laying on the steps. The kids being the ultimate lazy creatures that they are, would just walk over and on top of the gate so they destroyed 2 before we purchased this one. This one is VERY sturdy! We have been using it for approximately 3 months now and it has not budged from between the walls yet. It is extremely easy to open and close and closes by itself after going through the door of the gate. It has handled impatient kids pushing on the door to open it and slamming it after exiting. The biggest plus though is the height! No dogs can scale this one!",5
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,I liked this for my 6 month old son because it plays music and lights up. You can also press a couple of the buttons together or seperate and it plays together. It's neat and my son enjoys it.,4
Baby's My First Photo Album of Family &amp; Friends,Great album for my baby. I like he can look at family an friends that are not around on a daily basis. And when his daddy deploys we can fill it with pictures of him. We can clean it up after he's drooled all over it.,5

Fisher-Price My Little Snugabunny Ultra Comfort Musical Gym,"I am impressed with this toy, and my baby enjoys it most of the time! I like the moving mobile with lights! It plays songs while the mobile is moving, or another setting is moving mobile, lights and music! The music is annoying in my opinion, it is too crazy for little babies! I wish there was a setting for just lights and mobile, but no music! Other than that we like it!",4
Keekaroo Height Right Tray - Plastic Cover Quantity 1,"We LOVE this addition to our Keekaroo seat.  Seriously a must have especialy for our messy eater that likes to fling food.  It saves us a LITTLE pick up, and when he's chasing Cheerios around the tray they don't fall right off!",5
"Evenflo Portable BabySuite 300, Marianna","This product annoyed me from the moment I took it out of the box.Assembly is horrible, and that &#34;bassinet&#34; (ha ha) is pointless.They did everything wrong here.

"Kate Aspen Set of 4 Assorted Place Card/Photo Holder, Whooo's the Cutest Baby Owl","My daughter loves these.  We ordered them for her upcoming birthday party to be part of her favors.

The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Nail Clipper with Magnifier,"We LOVE these clippers.  We've used them for two years now on my infant, who is now a squirmy toddler.  We recently replaced our pair that broke (because the two year old tore them apart...not the fault of the product at all!) and were desperately waiting for the new pair to arrive because regular &#34;adult&#34; clippers just don't work on those soft little kid nails.  These clippers allow me to get a close clip without fearing that I'm going to hurt my kid, even while he's wiggling.  My mom loves them too;  she's the mother of 5 grown children and has seen a LOT of baby clippers in her day...she says that none compare to these!",5

Sassy Counting and Spell Bath Appliques,"Maybe I had too many expectations when I've purchased these for my son. Overall they are a lot of fun to teach a child letters and numbers, but being a bath sticker they don't stick on very well. You have to apply pressure to get them to stay on the wall. My kid had troubles to do that. But sure he had a lot of fun throwing them around for me to pick up. I still love them.",4
Blowout Blocker Diaper Extension - Prevent Diaper Blowouts (Blue),"I saw this product featured in a baby magazine while pregnant and ordered one to see if it actually worked.  I didn't end up using it the first few weeks, but that quickly changed once my daughter had her first blowout.  Anyone who has ever experienced a blowout knows that they can be quite messy.  This product has a velcro strap in the front that keeps it in place and also allows for adjustment as the baby gets bigger.  It's important to secure this snug on the baby (and overlapping the diaper).  If it's not snug the blowout blocker tends to ride up on my baby, which creates a gap in between the diaper and the blocker, which defeats the purpose.  When it's on properly, it really does work, and prevents poop from getting on my daughter's clothes.  When my daughter does have a blowout, I just take off the blocker, rinse off the damage and spray it with stain remover right away and then toss it in with the rest of her laundry.  It comes out surprisingly clean and can be used over and over.  I rotate between a few and use them daily.  Even if you don't want to use it all the time, I think it's a great product to use for special occasions in case you are worried about a particular outfit getting stained (think holidays, baptisms, when you are out in public, etc).",5
2014 Ferrari Baby Beline SP 3-in-1 Car Seat in Red,Love the Ferrari brand.  When we unpacked this seat though I could immediately tell it was a Ferrari seat.  I could feel and see quality in the construction.  I'm sure it will last a long time.  Would have paid this much for just a booster but seeing how it's a 3 in 1 booster sure to get a ton of use and my money's worth.  My son loves it.  Says it's his racecar seat.,5

Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,"After having traveled with my 18 month old last year while I was 5 months pregnant, I swore I would never travel alone again. You would have to be an octopus to handle all the items you need as you make your way through the airport: Stroller, carseat, luggage, child - and you only have 2 hands!I found the ""Traveling Toddler"" on Amazon and am so thrilled I purchased it. As luck would have it, I had to travel with my now 3 year old and my 1 year old by myself, and certainly could not have done so without this device. With this simple strap, I was able to convert my carseat and carry on into a stroller and push it with 1 hand. The other was free to hold onto the 3 year old's hand.The device uses the LATCH system hooks from your carseat to strap onto your luggage. If you keep the top one hooked to the device, you can easily unstrap and restrap your carseat. I have a Britax Roundabout and it worked like a charm.This is a very inexpensive way to keep your sanity when traveling with a carseat.",5
The First Years Clean Air Diaper Disposal System,"I can see this product has not gotten great reviews, which surprises me.  We have two daughters and have been through several diaper pails.  Off the top of my head, I know we've used the Diaper Genie, Diaper Champ, plastic bags, and this.  This has been our favorite by far.Pros:1.  No smell.  Even as our daughter is getting older (now 18 months) and as diapers usually get smellier, we have had no problem with stench.  You really have to take them at their word and change the filter and the batteries every 90 days (we have every 3 to 4 months) like they say.  Which is much more than I can say for either Diaper Genie, which has a strong odor hovering around the entire thing.  I've sat right next to this thing when it was overfilled and couldn't detect even the faintest smell.2.  It uses regular trash bags, so you don't have to buy special ones.  It's simple enough to use that my four year old begs to be able to put the bags in for me.  And you're not grossed out by having to take out giant sausages of diapers strung together (You know what I'm talking about...)3.  The fan is so faint that you'd probably never notice.  (I slept in the same room with it a couple times, and in the dead of night, when I was listening for it, I could hear it.)4.  You can fit several days of diapers in it.  You don't have to empty this thing every day or every other day.  And it beats filling up old grocery bags with diapers that you have to take out every single time.  (Tried that too after we were wallowing in disappointment from the diaper genie and hadn't yet bought something else.)Cons:1.  Price.  Purchasing both the container and the filter and D batteries can be pricey.  It's been worth it, though.  We spend less on it than we did on the diaper genie when you consider how much those refill packs are.2.  The container does tip over if you try to lift the lid (the full lid.  You only have to do this when you're emptying it.  You only lift half the lid when you're using it) and leave it there.  But it's a rather simple thing to lift the lid with one hand and pull out the bag of diapers with the other.  And we've never had a problem with it tipping over otherwise.3.  Price.  Oh yeah.  I already mentioned that.  Really, it's the only mention-worthy drawback, in my book.",5
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","I've been using these for almost a year and they are very helpful.  My 5 year old uses them for snacks regularly, we've used them for sandwiches, etc for the rest of us, and we've used them for baby stuff like pacifiers and teething gear so they stay clean.  We've cleaned them by just rinsing out the inside with soapy water and letting it air dry, but we've also ran them through the washer and dryer with our kitchen cloths and haven't had any problems.  They come in really cute prints, too!",5
2 Sensor Infant Movement Monitor,"It is a very useful device. I strongly recommend to all new parents so that they can sleep with no concern or leave their baby alone. When we started to use this device, we got some false alarms during night and we were really afraid of this case. However, it was due to distant placement of the sensors. when the sensors are apart from each other, sensors may not perceive the movements of the baby since she is too little. After we put the sensors together in the middle of the bed, we didn't get any false alarm. No negative side of the device. Good price, high quality, efficient work.",5
"LA Baby 4 Sided Changing Pad 32&quot;, White","I bought this and secured it to the top of a dresser type piece of furniture.I really like the four sides-makes it feel safe and secure.I've only used it for a few days now, as our boy is just 4 days old.I like it a lot so far, if i see it differently after awhile i will update my post.",5
"Boppy Noggin Nest Head Support, Brown Wheels","I noticed my son's head was getting flat on the back. My husband and I tried repositioning his head day and night with little results. When he is at daycare it's hard for the caregivers to constantly keep him off the back of his head. When we took him to the doctor for his 2 month check up the doc noticed his flat spot and said we may have to discuss a helmet at 4 months if there's no improvement. I was terrified that my baby might have to wear a helmet. I started to research these type of products and found the Boppy Noggin Nest. After 1 week we seen some improvement. It has been 4 weeks now and at his 4 month check up yesterday, the doc couldn't believe how much his head has improved and said no need to discuss the helmet. I use this in the swing, car seat, bouncy seat, crib, play gym, etc. This pillow is wonderful! I can't recommend it enough!!!",5
"KF Baby Diaper Bag Insert Organizer (9.6 x 5.6 x 7.2 inch, Black)+ Diaper Changing Pad Value Combo","I expected it to fit a DIAPER BAG seeing as how it is called a diaper bag insert....but it hardly fits a purse... guess i should have read the fine print for dimensions, I learned my lesson!",2
Bee Safe Belt (Blue),"My daughter was always getting out of her car seat, Bee Safe Belt protects my daughter. What is better than that? I was really starting to get scared of how easily she could get out, now she has no luck escaping :). I will defiantly purchases more as gifts and refer to friends, thanks so much!",5
Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,"This little Mobi is great! My two year old loves it and I can safely let him hold it without worrying about him getting burnt because it is too hot. It works as a great night light, especially in the bathroom. I love that it goes on when there is a power outage and give you another flashlight. However, it won't truly light a room, but it is better than nothing. I left the thing off teh base AND ON overnight. It was still glowing well after 15 hours off the charger.My one complaint is that the directions say it takes 8 hours to get a full charge. Mine didn't reach full charge status until well after 24 hours.",4
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","The brush is perfect for cleaning inside my Dr. Brown's bottles, until you take the brush out.  I was surprised with a spray of water splattering all over me!  My kitchen sink isn't very big, so I tried to do it low and sideways so I wouldn't get sprayed, but when I did that, my counter would get sprayed.  The nipple cleaner works well and the stand is nice, but due to the spraying nature of the bottle brush, I deducted a star.UPDATE (9/22/12) - These brushes do not last, i had to purchase another one since the top bristles of the brush eventually get flattened which renders it useless.  The second one just bit the dust.  I am not trying out other brushes, the Philips Avent one and Dr. Browns to see which one will last.",3
Medela 5 oz Breastmilk Bottle Set (3 Bottles),"The bottes came fast, very util and practical. Easy connect other medela products, then you can change botle to Medela Special Needs, : )",5
"Britax Advocate 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I love this carseat and so does my daughter. We have an SUV and it fits well. It is a large carseat so be sure it will fit in your vehicle. I did go to a store that sold them and tried her out in it before purchasing to make sure she was comfortable. It did take some adjusting in the car to get it level but in the end it fits great. I like that it has two options for the crotch strap - most carseats do not. Also, the secure latch *click* let's me know I have her in there perfect which I love. She looks tiny in there right now ( at 9.5 months she is 22lbs and 27 inches tall) and I love that she can stay rear facing for an extended period and that she can sit in this seat up to 70lbs. I have a mirror attached to the seat so I can see her in the rear view mirror which helps. It drives me crazy when I see a photo of a friends baby an Facebook with their child's strap hanging off their shoulder. That's not safe at all!!  I also loved the lower price offered by Amazon. Great purchase and great and safe carseat.",5
"The First Years Carry Me Near Sleep System, Cream","Although ""The First Years 5 in 1 Carry Me Near Sleep System"" isn't washable, overall, I didn't have a problem with the design, but unfortunately, the quality of the fabric and the poor craftsmanship warranted my returning it. Regarding the craftsmanship, in my opinion, the quality of the sewing and stitching is way below grade, and the absense of bar tacks is a clear sign of cost cutting. If you're looking for a heirloom piece, The First Years 5 in 1 Carry Me Near Sleep System isn't for you, for sure.",2
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Jumperoo,Our child loves spending time in her &#34;office&#34;.  The only down side to this device would be that it sit high off the ground for a 6 month old.,5

The First Years miPump Double Electric Breast Pump,I originally had a different brand product that gave out after about 1 month of use.  I returned it and got a refund and decided to try the miPump.  I started with the single unit and loved it so I bought the double unit and it has worked wonderfully.  I did rent a professional grade unit from my peds office but it was so bulky and definitely not able to take with you in the car (no batteries)and I ended up giving it back because this one worked as good if not better and has the ability to take with you wherever you go.  Just make sure you have several batteries if you are using the battery feature as it goes through them rather quickly.,5
Baby Rear Seat Car Mirror - For Rear Facing Baby in Back Seat - Easily Straps on and Secures to Headrest - Large Clear Reflective Adjustable Convex Mirror - Keeps an eye on your Precious Cargo - 100% Satisfaction Guaranteed or Your Money Back!,Originally bought E. Bauer from Target but it wouldn't attach to headrest in our CX-5.  This mirror works perfect and gives a nice broad view of the baby.  Super quick and easy to install and it adjusts easily and will hold it's position perfectly!!!  This is a great product if you're questioning which mirror to buy.,5
Medela Nipple Shield Regular 24mm,"Since the day my little one was born, he had trouble latching on. After speaking to several lactation consultants and trying several positions and holds...nothing seemed to work to get my little one to latch on. I resorted to pumping and feeding him breastmilk from a bottle. I was in tears knowing that i was unable to breastfeed directly from breast. after much research and continous attempts to get the little one to latch i found the nipple shields to be simply phenomenal. he latches on so much better with the nipple shields. I plan on continuing using the shields until i no longer breastfeed.",5
BABYBJORN Little Potty - Red,Purchased this after purchasing the Babybjorn Smart Potty because the other was too high at first. This one is just ever so slightly smaller and a much better fit for either small or early trained kids.,5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"I read so many reviews on so many different video monitors that I was dizzy! Every one of them had different things that people did not like. In the end I felt best going with the Infant Optics DXR-5. I bought it &#34;used&#34; on Amazon for about $70...an AMAZING price! I read the different ones available that were &#34;used&#34; and some had a scratch or were not in the original packaging. Mine came without any defect, damages, and in the original box. I have been using it every day for two weeks and so far - I love it! The picture quality is great in daytime lighting - so clear! The night vision  is also very clear when focused only on the crib. I have the camera set up to where it views almost the entire room... so empty areas of the room are a little pixel(ly) looking, but it is clear on actual objects and people. (hope that makes sense). My son's room is upstairs and this monitor works even when I am all the way down in the basement or in the yard! It was also important to me that the line/camera have 100% privacy..I have read that some monitors have picked up other video from neighbors' monitors! - This uses digital 2.4 Ghz wireless transmission that says it is 100% private in addition to using Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum for interference free connection. It also has an option that turns off the monitor when there is no noise (to conserve power) and it re-activates or turns back on when any noise is detected -  I should say I have not tried this. I have that feature turned off so that at night mine stays on so I can't say how well that feature works. The volume on the unit seems perfect to me - not too quiet- not too loud. As with any, there is a little bit of white noise when turned up high. That doesn't bother me because we sleep with a noise machine...Will report back if any problems arise in the future. But so far -SO happy!",5
"Chicco Cortina Keyfit 30 Travel System, Miro",Probably not the lightest travel system existing but so well made and stylish in the same time. You do need some space in your trunk... Very happy to have it!,5

Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"My daughter in law had one for her son's and recommended I purchase one for my other daughter in law to use on my grand daughter.  The Aspirator works very, very well.  There is a filter and a one way valve, so no worries about sucking in something you don't' want to!  Highly recommend for the little ones who are stuffed up.  Works great!",5
"Safety 1st Easy Grip Brush And Comb, Colors May Vary",perfect for the price. Needed simple brush. Note that they come in different colors than what you see in the picture- I got green and thought I was getting orange.,5
"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red",I purchased this stroller because it had a good rating and it has lived up to that rating. It was affordable and not as flimsy and cheaply made as the $20 strollers at my local Walmart. I needed something a bit more durable that my son wouldn't have a fit sitting and riding in and this stroller fits the bill.,5
Snuza Hero Baby Movement Monitor,"I purchased this product to help me sleep at night without wanting to get up and check my son every few minutes. It does exactly what it says it does. If the child stops breathing, the vibration goes off to try and wake the baby and after that the alarm goes off.If I was purchasing this device again I don't know that I would buy this model. I think I would buy the version without the vibration feature.Snuza Portable Baby Movement Monitor, Orange/White, 0-12 MonthsOurs has gone off several times, and the baby was breathing fine, but it didn't even wake him. So I don't feel the vibration does much.I only have 2 small complains about the alarm. First, I would like to see a different way of attaching the device to the child. My son moves around a lot when sleeping and the device slips off in the middle of the night causing the alarm to go off. The other problem is if your child sleeps on their side, the device may still be attached to their diaper but the tip will not be touching their stomach so the alarm will go off. I don't think there is much that can be done about that.As a side note, the first one I bought had a problem after 3 months. It still worked but you couldn't turn it off. I called and they replaced the device without any questions. I was able to keep the defective one until the new one arrived so I could continue to use it.",5
Baby Planet Unity Sport Stroller Red Tech,"I just received this stroller in the mail and am very happy with it. I am expecting my second son any day, and have an 18 month old son. I've already taken him for a couple walks in it, so he gets used to it and he really likes it. It's so easy to steer and turn, much easier than any other strollers that I tried out in Babies R Us. It is a little hard to fold up, but I've read other reviews that say after a few times of folding it, it gets ""worn in""  I highly recommend this stroller.",5
Sassy Terry Teethers 2Pk,"Best investment I ever made!  Yes it's essentially a washcloth but it's so nice to always have a specific frozen cloth ready for those fussy moments.  Honestly, with these frozen cloths I can get the serenity in a moment when I need it the most. Great item.",5

Kick Mats - Deluxe Car Seat Back Protectors 2 Pack - Keep Your Car Seats 100% Clean From All The Stains And Scuffmarks Left By The Kids With These Auto-Protective Seat Covers - Designed For Most Vehicles - Protect Your Investment - Lifetime Guarantee,"Great no-nonsense kick mats that I think would work for just about anyone and any vehicle!  I was on the hunt for some affordable and effective kick mats since my almost 3 year old has decided that putting her feet on the back of my new Odyssey seats is a great novelty. I was a little worried that these mats wouldn't work since I have handles on the back of my front seats near the top, but they cover those just fine and fit around the very wide seat bottom of my Minivan. These mats don't have any pockets or loops, but that's exactly what I wanted. I didn't want anything enticing my kiddo by drawing her attention....I want her to leave my seats alone. Perfect solution. I only took one star off because they are fairly thin and while I've only had these about a week, I can't speak to how well they will hold up long term.",4
"Graco Duo 2 in 1 Swing with Plug, Carlisle","I enjoy it, my baby boy love it, he feel comfortable when he ride it. Music good, ac plug in will save your money so you don.t have to buy battery.looks great. I think i made the right choice.",5
Botanical Multi 4 pc Toddler Bedding Set,"I received this item quickly and was very pleased with it. My 2-year old loves it, too. However, I did not receive the pillowcase. I have tried to contact the seller, but I have not heard anything back yet. It's a really great set, but be warned that you might not get all of it, and considering the customer service, it's possible you never will.",4
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","Our baby LOVES this mobile. When he was little, it was the only way I could leave him long enough to take a shower. Now that he's a little older (6 months), he loves to watch it before he drifts off to sleep. We could not live without it!",5

"NUK Learner Cup BPA Free Silicone Spout, Single Pack, Colors May Vary","I tried a bunch of sippy cups and this was the only one she not only liked, but quickly figured out how to use herself.  She's 8 months old now and I just bought the next stage... the EZ cup and I give her her formula in it now.  She's fine with it.  Lays there and relaxes.  I already ordered the Active cup for when she's a little older.  And I love that the spouts are interchangeable with the whole series!!!!",5
Rocking Moses Basket Stand Natural,We ended up using the bassinet of our stroller together with this rocker on a daily basis. I did not feel like running up and down to the second floor to put my baby down for a nap. We are planning to use our UppaBaby Vista stroller (great stroller!) together with this rocker for our second baby.,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Got this a few days ago and set it up for our daughter to get acquainted with. She's 2 years old and was able to get on and off of it without any help or problems. I do wish it locked into the open position, but that's nothing major. We haven't used it for a full night yet, so the true test of time is yet to be determined. But, so far so good!",5
Levana LV-TW502 Safe N' See Advanced 3.5-Inch Digital Video Wireless Baby Monitor with Talk to Baby Intercom and Remote Controlled Lullabies,We read some reviews online and after reading about this product we decided to go for this!Works just perfect. . . You can adjust the sensitivity yourself and have full control over the baby sleeping. We love the little feature playing lullabies. . .Having the option to run the camera on batteries as well makes this product really good for people traveling and camping. !Pros:excellent picture day and night.. nightvision really works and is automatically managed by the camera.two-way communications...remote controlled night light - can turn it on and off without going into the room..remote temperatureremote music - can turn it on and off after you see your kid is asleeppower saving... remote monitor can be setup to be sound sensitive to only show screen when sound is heard (adjustable)Camera can be operated with battery.The LCD uses Nokia BL-5C battery!Cons:So far no bad.We recommend this product!,5
"Pampers Airwave Venting System, Stage 1, 5 Ounces, Clear, Triple Pack","I spent ALOT of money on these!! BIG WASTE!! Not only do they cause alot of gas but it doesn't help colic at all. When my daughter was drinking, the nipple would collapse back inside the nipple holder causing her formula to spill all over her face. I do not recommend. Plus the nipple is so big for a babys tiny mouth that formula just spews out the sides of her mouth causing yet another big mess! Don't waste your time. Save your money.",2

Playtex One-Step Breast Milk Storage Kit,"Singleton mama's pump half the milk as twin mama's.  The playtex adaptors resolve some serious logistics issues and make life easier.  When a twin mama pumps for 10 - 15 minutes, out comes 12 - 16 ounces, so you would fill 4 of those little 4 ounce bottles!  Not only do you ahve to stop pumping and switch half way through, but you have to store and combine twice the bottles!  Ugh!  I got tired of it all and went searching for a solution.I wanted a way to pump into a container that would hold everything that came out of each breast. I needed to pump into something that would hold 8 ounces.  And I discovered these and loved them!",5
Summer Infant Sure &amp; Secure Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate in Black,"I've been an avid Amazon customer for a couple of years now with many purchases under my belt. However, until now, I was never compelled to share my thoughts about any of my purchases because most purchases have generally met our expectations and nothing more.Well, I have to say that the Summer Infant Metal Gate has met AND exceeded our expectations. I did not know what to expect with this product having had old flimsy plastic gates in the past (for my kids). This product is not only aesthetically pleasing to the eye, but is extremely well designed and built. It is an all around solid product.We purchased this metal gate as well as Summer Infant's decorative wood and metal gate in preparation for our upcoming puppy. We are equally pleased with the wood and metal gateSummer Infant Metal and Wood Walk-Thru Gate. Obviously only time well tell if the gates will be able to withstand any punishment from our upcoming puppy.In terms of installation, it took a bit of time to adjust the gate in order to square it up properly, but once this was achieved the gate latches worked great and the gates stand firmly in place.We could not be happier with our purchase!",5
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","We purchased this Carseat for our 11 month old coming out of a Britax infant seat.  However, it wasn't the Carseat we bought first.  I tried to save money by buying the Combi Coccoro.  Both seats are known for being narrow for installation of three seats across the back of smaller cars.  The Combi Coccoro was really nice.  It installed quickly and was less of an investment.  Everything was great until we put our 11 month in it.  Her head was already too close to top.  So we returned the seat .  Best thing we did!  We went ahead and purchased the Radian for her.  The purple Radian RXT is perfect rear facing!  We did purchase the radian foam piece so that the front passenger seat did not have to be so far forward.  I was foolish for trying to save about a hundred bucks buying the Combi Coccoro.  i should have known better because we know how much we love the Radian.  Our four year old has been in one for 5 months now ( the sixth Carseat we have purchased for him in four years). I wish we had been able to purchase this as his first Carseat or at best second.  We now have two Radian RXT seats.  The only problem now is ...... We need two more for our other car to replace our Britax Marathon and Britax Frontier!!!  Yes, the Dionos have impressed me so much I am not as much of a Britax fan as before.",5

"Playtex Baby Binky Silicone Newborn Pacifier, 0-6 Months and above,Colors May Vary","It is true that you cannot pick color etc. I was sent blue pacifiers with little trucks on them. The blue was a nice color though, and these pacifiers are hard to find so I just removed the decal myself. They wear off after a while anyway. I will definitely be ordering these again because the shape of the ""nipple"" is unique and my girl won't even take the oh-so-similar Playtex Binky as a substitute.",5
Sleep Buddy ~ Sleep Training System for Toddlers &amp; Pre-schoolers,"If your kido is having trouble sleeping in. This is a great option. Our son fell in love with the reward system and the light it self. Having your kid storm in AFTER 7 am with a big smile with &#34; daddy daddy , my light turned off ! &#34; makes it worth every cent. Plus the little story book that goes along with it is a great introduction to the clock. 4/5 only because the  electronics on The little guy are a little cheap , but functional.",4
"Kid'Sleep Classic, Blue",I am usually pretty good at figuring out basic things...but after reading and re-reading the instructions (more than several times) I just couldn't figure it out.  I threw the clock in the garbage!,1
"Fisher-Price Baby's First Sippy, 2-Count",This has been the perfect sippy cup to help transition our almost 10 month old from  bottle to cup at meal time. It is easy for him to hold and the moving spout inside insures that he always gets water. Easy to assemble and take apart to clean. Very happy,5
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump Spare Parts Kit,"I wish I had ordered this when the pump was ordered! My husband was washing them out for me and ripped the piece that drips milk into the bottle. The pump won't work without it! So, I had to pump one side at a time until they came. Everyone who pumps should order this just to have!",5
"Dr. Brown's PreVent Design Pacifier, Neutral, Stage 2,  6-12 Months",This is the second time I am buying it. The teat is flat and I can tell my son prefers this shape to others.,5
"DaVinci Emily 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","The cherry wood itself is very great, however, the painting is easy to be scratched during delivery and installation. Both the packaging & delivery should be more careful.The deliverer put it to my condo guard while I was at home, why not sent the huge heavy item directly to my door?",4
"Evenflo Serenade Infant Car Seat, Honeycomb Baja",This carseat is absolutely perfect. My twin sons were born very small and scrawny. I had this carseat and a $130 graco carseat. My twin in the graco carseat looked uncomfortable and his head kept was never secure and slumped. But in this carseat it had a cushion to keep the head up. It also a large sun visor that covers half the carseat. Did i mention it is well cushioned? With the twins i have 4 kids and so i know carseat well. This is one of the best carseats.,5
"Valco Baby Universal Cup Holder, Black","I don't have any stroller age kids, but to avoid further loss of coffee mugs off the top of my car I started looking for a cup holder I could attach to my Yakima roof rack. The Lionheart model I used for a year or more required extensive modification, and it wouldn't hold insulated cups unless the handle was open at the bottom, but it once carried a coffee mug safely from Bellevue to Seattle! After it broke I found the Valco, which attached easily and might even fit a square Thule cross bar. It seems a lot tuffer, and some closed handle mugs will fit. Best thing is I'll be the talk of the parking lot at the ski areas!",5
"Kidkusion Large Driveway Safety Sign, Yellow",Very happy with the sign. The sign is a great warning to all motorists to slow down.Children are near.We love having the bright yellow sign. So glad we made the purchase.,5
"Munchkin Baby Bath Ball, Colors May Vary","This toy looked pretty unimpressive to me, but my child was in the age-range listed on the packaging, so I picked it up because I needed a tub toy. Turns out, it's a deceptively clever little toy! The side with the cut-outs is flexible, so you can collapse it and it springs back into place - it's also easy for baby to grab. The other side has perforations so that baby can strain bathwater through it. And, like another reviewer mentioned, you can use it to gently rinse off soap suds - super handy! There's a clear plastic ball inside with little sea-shapes that rattle around as the ball rolls around inside the toy. For whatever reason, at my house, this toy isn't just for the bath! My daughter loves it and carries it all over the place so that I have to search for it at bath time. Now my husband has taken to keeping it in his car because she'll play quietly with it in her carseat - she shakes it a little bit and falls asleep! So that's it: I'm ordering more of these.",5
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Quarter Moon","Unfortunately, I am now in the market for a non rechargeable style night light for my 3 year old.After the mobi tyke lite failed in 3 mos, I now have had this Kinderglo for under a year.  While it still does work, about 6 mos after use, the pink is sputtery & the blue has faded.I typically leave on charger always. It is on about 12 hours a day. Sometimes it is bright still in the morning, other times it is very dark, looks like the battery is running down. I know that it is fully on its base, I have no idea why it does this.Nobody plays with it. The only time it is taken from its base is when I turn it on at night.I very badly wanted to like this.",2
Mobi Tykelight GloMate Plus,"I love this nap light, and so does my son. I would LOVE to give it a 5 star review, but I just can't.The naplight itself is fantastic. Safe, just enough light, lasts all night. HOWEVER, the charging station is terrible! It is very touchy  even when new. You have to get it on just so. Over time, it becomes harder and harder to get the position ""just right"". Ours is still pretty new and sometimes it takes me 10 minutes to wiggle it into the one perfect spot where it will charge.Before I purchased our Tyke Light, I read several other reviews that mentioned this problem. It is not just a problem with a few ""lemons"", it is a design flaw, and all lights will eventually stop charging.My daughter has the Munchkin puppy light, and it charges great. I would actually like the tyke light a little better than the munchkin if it were not for the issues with the charger. While it will take a charge it's awsome!",3
Summer Infant Deluxe Comfort Booster- Tan,"This seat is lightweight and portable, easy to clean and conveniently folds for storage. It's not super heavy duty and I wouldn't leave a child unattended, but for occasional use under supervision, this is a great buy!!",4
Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,"I'm a busy mom and I have tried 3 different bottle warmers. I must say that at the end, I came with the conclusion that it is much easier and faster to use hot tap water in the deepest bowl/mug you have. You fill the bowl up with hot water, put the bottle inside, and by the time you are done changing your baby's diaper the bottle is warm enough. You can shake the bottle to make sure there is no hot spots, and if it makes you feel better, test the temperature on the back of your hand. It's a low-tech but efficient method, and it works every time! :)",1
"Baby Cubes Baby Food Storage Contains no Phthalates, Bisphenol-A, PVC 2 Pack","I tried ice cube trays and nursing tubes.  I found this to be one of the best ways to store and reheat baby food.  It snaps tightly, stacks perfectly and stores neatly in my freezer.  I set it in the fridge the night before and microwave the food directly in the container, with the list open for ventilation.",5
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,"I put one of these on my toughest, hardest and most used area of my house. The pull out trash bin in our kitchen cabinets. The four girls, 5 and under, in my house constantly pull, tug and try to unlatch this thing. After a month of using it, it is still working and still attached to the cabinets.I have yet to try and remove one, and I have some concern about the ability to get all the glue off the cabinet when I do, or if it will be damaged. That is here nor there to me because I don't have to worry about an 18 month old draggin old nasty diapers out of the trash bin!Great find and definitely a good buy!",5
"Britax Boulevard 70 CS Convertible Car Seat, Biscotti","Bought two of these car seats for our twin girls. We have them rear-facing at 13-months old/ 21 lbs. Great pattern and soft material. The girls are comfortable in them and the straps don't seem to bother them at all. It's easy to get the seat out of the car; not as quick/easy to lock it back into the car (this may not be an issue if you only have one child/ one car seat and don't have to pull out the seat very often; plus this is probably an issue with any car seat because they are much bigger/bulkier than the snap & go's). Agree with other comments about visibility. They have to strain their little heads forward to see out the window or to see eachother. All in all, great seats. I would buy them again.",4
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","Not sure it is because our child is so lean, but we had trouble getting the harness tight enough. We followed instructions to a tee and are veteran car seat users. However, we still struggled getting the harness pulled tight enough and the tightening strap was really stiff/difficult to tighten. We would pull and pull and it barely moved.  Also, the release buckle was difficult for me to release with it being in the tiny fabric opening and you have to push the release button in and not up like the Marathon we currently have already.  We bought this for our 4 year old in hopes to use as a booster later. However, due to the strap issue, we had to return it for something else. We were surprisingly disappointed as we love all of our previous Britax seats. Otherwise, the seat is well made and very sturdy.",2
Fisher-Price Pink Sparkles Tub,"My mother in law bought this for us. It gets the job done, but even with the netting for the newborn feature, my baby doesnt lay securely in the tub. Making it difficult to bath her without someone elses help. I have to hold her in place with one hand the entire time becuase the net doesnt do exactly what it says it does.",3
"Graco UrbanLite Stroller, Rittenhouse","got this product 6 months ago and I still love it. My 5 year old was able to sit comfortably in it so I know it will grow with my 11 month old. I did a lot of research and found this to be the best stroller for the price. I was a little bummed I couldn't try it out in the store but still it had all the features I wanted.-only two front wheals.... not those stupid double things that get in the way-it has a metal bar for the back seat adjustment.... no strap to get tangled and I can do it with one hand. I think they did a good job with the angles it sits/reclines/lays at too.-large basket.... I'm able to take this to the rec center and fit towels, swim toys, clothes, shoes and lunch under for both my sons and I.-trays/drink holders.... I can have two large drinks for me and feed my baby his lunch on his tray.... plus I didn't have to pay $20 extra.-I can sling a large diaper bag over the back and it doesn't tip over.-large sun shade-straps... I was able to remove the shoulder straps (pointless!) and have a 3 point system for my baby.-small.... really, I can do SO much with this stroller for it's compact size-fits my graco safe seat!-wipes clean easily-can unfold with one hand... although it can be a bit tricky.-one lever to release the brakes..... I can even do it barefoot.-adjustable handle bar... I can push it in heals and I can lower it when my oldest wants to push.-screen sides on sun shade... keeps my baby from fussing because he can sit back and still see out!-Tray swings out so it's easy to change a diaper.-Folds compactly... It may not be as small as a umbrella stroller but with the handle bar folded under I can lay it on it's side in my suv and it takes up VERY LITTLE space.What I don't love-the color ran a tad when some water from the swimming pool got on it. I think it was the chemicals because I've wiped it many times since then and the color has stayed.-the sun shade can either be folded up, over your baby or released from the back and in the front of your child.... there is no 'middle ground.' because you have to release the shade by a velco tab on the back. It was a bummer when I found that out.-the black color. I liked the 'antique' look with the fabric and so did my husband (who is very particular about our boys not having 'girly' prints) but that changed once our baby had a snack.... man it looked dirty! The plus side is that it wipes clean very easily (I'm talking baby wipes in the middle of costco and 3 did the job)-lame 'tray' for adults. Really, they could have put a larger one it.... you don't need an open area to fold it. I think the little tray is for a smart phone because mine fits perfectly. I don't mind the small tray so much because I just put things in my purse I hang on the back.All in all I would still buy this stroller again. I really do love it.",5
"BabyKicks Set of 3 Nursing Pads, Fleece","These are by far the best washable nursing pads I've found so far. I am a rather heavy leaker, so it's been a challenge to find washable pads that work, but I can't stand the idea of throwing away all those disposable nursing pads. These aren't perfect (they definitely aren't invisible under a thin bra or nursing tank, but I have yet to find anything that is), but they contain leaks very well and feel nice against the skin. I like them enough that I'm planning to order a few more sets.",4
Regalo Easy Diner Portable Hook-On High Chair,Bought two as baby shower gifts - I used a chair called a &#34;sassy seat&#34; when my boys were young and LOVED it so this is my go to gift for all baby shower gifts.This chair is more a Cadillac to the one I used back-in-the-day.,5
SoHo - Sage Diaper bag with changing pad 6 pieces set,"Great size, nice color, everything fits perfect.Would definitely recommend to others.Anyone who purchases this item wont regret it.",5
Prince Lionheart Stroller Gate Check Bag,"I highly recommend the Prince Lionheart Car Seat Check Bag and Stroller Check Bags! I was traveling alone with my 10 month old baby and 9 year old and was able to carry this easily along with my baby in a front carrier and baby bag (and the Car Seat Check Bag when we had to switch to a different plane!!). I ended up using this for a gate check bag and in no way or any form did it get destroyed. It has minor scuffs now that I used it on two trips, but it held up well and did not tear or break. I was able to fit my Chicco Nuevo Stroller in it, though the wheels did hang out. I may be my stroller though because when it folds the wheels are on both ends vs. one. But even though they hung out, it was easy to roll it around when I needed to, There are two handles, one hand and another for over the shoulder making it very easy to carry and maneuver. There is a drawstring to secure the tie and it can fold up into itself when not in use. It does take a moment to get the stroller in, so make sure you get it in before you board and present it to the desk. I didn't use it as a checked bag, but based on the construction I don't think it would rip or tear.",5
BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"While this chair works fine, it's just not comfortable.  My son's little bottom is so red after just sitting on it for a short time!  He ends up either standing for some relief or moving around the chair in an attempt to find a comfortable position.  If I had to do it over again, I would buy something with a cushy seat.  Wouldn't buy this one again...",2
"Bright Starts Rattle and Shake Barbell Rattle, Pretty in Pink",i got this for my grandson.  he loves to shake it and put it in his mouth.  i guess he likes it!,5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","My 18 month old absolutely loves his new backpack. It is the perfect size for him, and he can fit a few stuffed animals and some books inside. He walks all around the house wearing it. The one I received is definitely from Skip Hop.",4
Lamaze Musical Inchworm,my little baby loves this thing! perfect for any newborn up through many months old.  great for entertaining your little ones!,5
K's Kids Deluxe Patrick Shape Sorting House,"When my baby was little this was a wonderful toy to learn shapes & sorting. It is so cute! Plus, the roof has a dogie on it & on the other side a mirror.Now, years after I received it from my sister who bought it in Europe, it remains one of the favorites. My baby likes to play with different small animals, & this now makes the perfect house for various families of animals. Great for pretend & play games for the older children. Overall, the educational & fun value is outstanding. And the quality of the materials used is rare nowadays.",5
"Naturepedic Organic Cotton Bassinet Fitted Sheet, Ivory",It fits great.  It is super soft. I wish it fit on my bed. Washes great. I Iove that it is made in the USA.,5
"OXO Tot Bottle Brush with Nipple Cleaner and Stand, Green","Excellent bottle brush.I've had the pink one for over a year, using it on a daily basis. At first I had no idea how to use the nipple cleaner (which is a great feature), but once my wife showed me it was able to get in many crevices in my daughter's bottles.We primarily use the Avent bottles, and this brush is perfect. Despite how soft the bristles may feel, they really clean the bottles and attachments thoroughly. At first I thought the colored bristles were tougher, but upon closer inspection I think they're colored just for show. But the quality is overall top notch.The stand is nice in that you can detach the bottom for cleaning, and there's a little hole and lip to let the water out.Got blue this time, and will probably get another color in a year if I'm still cleaning bottles daily.",5
"Bunnies by the Bay Wee Plush, Emmie","Adorable, soft,and well made. Shipped quickly, would recommend. A must for Bunnies by the Bay collectors. You will not be disapointed.",5

Beco Butterfly II 2 Baby Carrier Natalie,The product is so soft and the only thing sometime that will put the baby to sleep when she is fussy. We are going to order another one!,5
"Snappi Cloth Diaper Fasteners - Pack of 3 (Pink, Purple, White)",Purchased these to use with my Osocozy cloth diapers and they work as they were intended. They are easy to use and make it easier to put a diaper cover on over the diaper.  No complaints.,5
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White",We're pleased with the quality and the ease of installation.  Guests also have no problem opening and closing these gates.  May purchase another...,5
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"We purchased this along with the Graco Snugride 35 for our daughter who was born a year ago and it is hard, looking back, to think of another piece of out-and-about baby gear (other than a carrier/sling) as useful as this one.  At the basic level, it's great because you can steer it one handed even when it's loaded up and you can access the generously sized storage basket even when the carseat is in place (you'd like to think that this would be true of any stroller or stroller frame; sadly no).  You can collapse it one handed, open it one handed, and put it in the trunk with one arm (because it's so light).  ""Can I use this one-handed?"" is a great way to screen ANY piece of baby gear.More than that, it has been our go-to piece of gear for the first 11 months of life.  It's been our sherpa in the airport, allowing me traveling alone with the baby to easily schlep the diaper bag and carseat from one gate to the next (traveling alone with a 9 month old, I went ahead and bought the baby a seat so I could set her down sometimes.  On that note, I had no trouble at all fitting the Snugride 35 into an airplane seat.  On another note, there was 1 flight out of 4 where the flight attendant stated that, even though purchasing the seat in the first place was elective, SINCE I'd purchased it using it was now mandatory during taxi, take-off, and landing, ""even if she's screaming.""  So I would definitely NOT buy a seat for a baby under 6 months or a baby that could not be distracted for that amount of time or if you wanted to nurse during those times.  In our case, she was able to eat baby food -oh ANOTHER FYI, bring re-sealable pouches not jars when traveling and choose the thickest and therefore least drippy/messy purees you can find- during those times and was perfectly happy).Even though she's often in the Baby Bjorn (which, by the way, if you get one, definitely get one with lumbar support.  We started off with a regular one and shelved it by the time she was 3 months old whereas the Synergy is still perfectly comfortable.  And if you live somewhere at all warm, I would highly recommend white mesh over the solid black or navy fabric.  We are now looking into the Beco though because after 6 months it really is nice to be able to hip-carry or back-carry.  Besides that, you technically shouldn't forward face in the Baby Bjorn because their legs go numb.  But I digress...), so yes, even though she's often in the Baby Bjorn, we'd often bring this thing into the mall to carry our coats and hats, the diaper bag, our coffee (which is safe when the baby isn't in it), our purchases and so on.She used it as a walker wagon in the airport, killing time between connections.  Do get the Graco Snugride 35 to go with it.  I loved using the shade when she fell asleep in the car (especially when we were moving and driving at night; it blocked the headlights zooming by) and easily moving her sleeping self into the house or out to errands.  And in winter, it was nice to easily bring her seat in over night so that it wasn't icy-cold in the mornings.  Plus, with a weight limit of 35 pounds, it will help her stay rear-facing for a long time.",5
Munchkin My First Turtle Shower,"First off, the tubing was bent and the little piece actually floated so when you pushe the button, it was sucking air. It did finally straighten out but it's no fun. It's small so it's really just something for the kids to push on and see water squirt out. I was hoping there'd be some syphon action where they could push the button a couple times to get the water started; but not so. It is cute but the kids don't play with it.",2
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Soft Pink, Small",My grandson already had a couple of HALO SleepSacks for winter.  This 100% cotton one is perfect for warmer weather.  My daughter doesn't have to worry about her little guy kicking off his cover.  This is a great idea!!,5
"Baby Jogger 2010 City Select Single Stroller, Onyx","We have a 2yr old and a 2 month old. I wanted a double stroller that I could switch the seats to be forward or rear-facing. The city select seemed perfect! It's not, BUT I still really like it! And don't regret spending $600+ on it. I use the 2 seats, did not get bassinet or car seat adapter.Pros:I'm 5'9"" and love how far the handle extends.Love the brake on the handleI like how easily and far back the seats recline. My 2mo old is very comfortable and safely restrained in his seat (even tho they officially say that it is recommended for infants 6mo+)Like the diamond color and it seems to clean easily. I've had to wipe up some strawberry juice and it came right off.Like the generous sun shades. Tho I must admit I have unzipped the mesh on the back (they say not to) to give it more room (to completely cover my baby when he's reclined)Great basket with zippers to expand.Customer service is great - had a rip in basket. Called them and they shipped another the next day.LOVE that I can have my kiddos facing me or turn them around. I switch them up all the time. Of course, I don't use all 20 configurations, but I switch between 3 quite often.Cons:I didn't want a tandem stroller and this one is a bit tandem-like with both seats on. But of course it would be when you're trying to fit 2 kids on 1 stroller!Difficult to push up and down dips in the sidewalk with my 30lb girl in the front. Makes my outside wrist sore. I did find a configuration that I liked with her closer to me and the baby in front.Tough to push up over curbs.  It's sturdy and I can actually pop it up just by pushing down on the handle with all my weight, but it's hard.It's heavy to get in and out of my trunk. Oh well, it's what I expected.",4
Medela Breastmilk Collection and Storage Bottles 8oz (250ml) - 2 Each,great price and great product. they do hold more than 8 oz if you need that. the ounces are raised and not printed so you don't have to worry about it rubbing off in the wash.,5
Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo Busy Baby Booster,"We bought this chair 15 months ago, & we AND our granddaughter are STILL thrilled with it!  We have loaned it to Maddie's parents to take along for a week at the beach, or whatever, because it is more compact & easier to handle during travel than a standard booster chair, & have taken it to local restaurants when the five of us wanted to have dinner out.  It is sturdy, very easy to clean, & while Maddie's entertainment values have changed over the intervening months, she still likes having the play bar on the tray if she's waiting for a snack or meal.  This chair will work well for us for several more years (until Maddie is big enough to sit up to the table in a grown-up chair), & has proved to be EXCELLENT value for money.  This is a real winner -- & when we're finished with it we can proudly donate it to a local charity boutique for resale in their children's shop.",5
"Nuby 2 Count 2 Handle Cup with No Spill Super Spout, Colors May Vary","Daughter likes these cups. Sometimes lid can be challenging to get on. Handles very close to cup, but works for us.",4
Nuby Icybite Hard/Soft Teething Keys,My son really loved this and I like that you can refrigerate it for use as a teething ring.  Really love that it is dishwasher friendly.  Would definitely purchase again!,5

MobiCam Audio Video Baby Monitoring System,This monitor works very well.  The picture is clear and love the color and night time vision!,5
"Stork Craft Custom Tuscany Espresso Finish Glider and Ottoman with Free lower lumbar pillow, Beige Cushions","This chair is a great value! I purchased it for our nursery and it looks beautiful. It was very easy to assemble (probably took a total of 30 minutes), and is pretty light - I didn't have any trouble moving it into the nursery by myself (pregnant). It looks just as nice as chairs that cost significantly more money, and I'm definitely happy that we decided to go with this one over something more expensive. The cushions are more firm than some other options I tried, but I wanted that as I've found super soft cushions to be uncomfortable and don't suitable support my back or tailbone for more than a few minutes. I can understand previous reviewers feedback about the chair being designed for &#34;smaller&#34; women, but I think that perspective might be a little skewed. I am 5'7 and 190 lbs eight months pregnant (not exactly petite), and I fit in the chair just fine, even with a nursing pillow around my belly. I could see that this chair would probably be too small if you were very tall or very heavyweight.",5
"Tommee Tippee Explora Easi Roll Bib, Pink and Purple, 2 Count","These bibs are AWESOME. so easy to clean, and the best part is they catch all of the dropped food. We are doing BLW and instead of making of a mess of the highchair/her lap we can just grab the dropped food out of the bib and back onto her tray.But make sure you shop around. This price is double what I paid for the same 2 pack of bibs elsewhere!",5

Summer Infant Deluxe Comfort Booster- Tan,Its easy to secure it onto the chair and my 7 month old daughter loves to sit and play on it.I wish sliding in and out the tray was easier and the cut marks under the tray was smoother. The plastic scratched my daughter a bit when I pulled her out with tray extended out. I would need to cover it up with paper tape...Also on a regular height table and chair the booster seat won't slide under the table like it shows on the box. Unless you get a shorter chair. If the arm rest was detachable or bendable outdated seat would slide under the tableOverall it does it's job.,3
Nuby Monster 7oz Monster 2 Handle No-Spill Sippy Cup- 4M+,The 'arms' kept coming off the cup and eventually they were lost and the cup cracked after one fall from the high chair. It only lasted a few months.,1
"MAM Trends Silicone Pacifier, Blue, 0-6 Months, 2-Count","Love these binkies only ones I've used with my babies, easy to clean I the container, fun cute colors for baby girl.",5
"Soft Gear My Deluxe Changing Mat, Pink",I decided to go with this rather than the typical foam/cloth changing table pads and I'm so glad I did! I'm a new mother so I'm not exactly a pro at changing diapers and lets just say if this were cloth I'd be washing it daily! Luckily I can just wipe it clean quick and easy. I didn't give it 5 stars b/c my little one is still small so I cant say how it will be fit wise once she gets older but I'm sure she will fit. It also did have a slight smell when it was new but I bought it before she was born and within a few days (after a good washing) the smell was completely gone.,4
BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,I love this product because I can just scoop up toys after the kids have had their baths. This product's suction cup has only separated from the tile it's attached to once in the last month. We have a lot of toys in the basket so falling off of the wall once a month seems more than reasonable.,5
"Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, Green/Blue","my son loves to sit in this, even just as a chair. easy to pack up and go, we used it in a hotel room for meals and snacks and it worked great.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog","I showed my three year-old daughter photos of the different animals and she picked out the frog. She loves her backpack! Very well made, great size for a toddler. Fantastic item!",5
Happy Tails 4-Piece Crib Bedding Set,"What a great price on this bedding set!  The Lamb and Ivy brand is a well known brand and the design is so cute, and pretty gender neutral.  Our first baby girl is expected to arrive in about 2 months so we decided to order this set in case she has a little brother in the future, he can use the same bedding.  We registered this set and our friends ordered them and had them sent to us.  We got them today and they look just like the picture.  The colors are great.  We got some extra sheets at Ikea and the green totally goes with the green in this set.",5
Boutique Brand New GEENNY Boy Sailor 13PCS Baby Nursery CRIB BEDDING SET,"First of all this was a gift for my niece and I am a gift perfectionist so I do expect quality. Having said that. what I really appreciated about this particular ""nautical"" crib layette was that the colors were not your average expected nautical theme colors in strictly red, white and blue, yet at the same time you still had the intended  ""nautical"" theme clearly shine through, with lots of vibrant coloring yet done with such a classy touch with the tones of the colors and the timeless look to walk into a nursery w/out over doing it and just to note so not to mislead anyone the colors are still as vibrant and very naturally just a ""STEP UP"" if you will on colors and the placements.a boys set. I guess it could be used for a girl if you were to be looking for a boating style crib bedding but I guess for me when I think for a little girl I tend to automatically lean towards pink all the way  and not all moms to be do, So if you wanted to incorperate a nautical themed set into your little girls nursery then I also would say that this still by far would still be my selected set. I hope everyone else whom decides to purchase finds this to be as beautiful as I described~! P.S. I in adition purchased on amazon a set of 2 wooden anchors to hang and then 2 sets of the easily removeable wall stickers that pop up when viewing this set and the 2 sets I decided on purchasing were so perfect in color match. (look up my selection or email me) and to top it off I of course did buy the lamp shade and the wall hangings and mobile for that price how could you not?Good Luck~! Amy",5
Mobi MobiCam Audio Video Wireless Internet Kit,"This kit includes drivers, webcam software, and pass-through cable to connect the MobiCam monitor to your PC via USB.An additional monthly subscription fee is required if you actually want to view your MobiCam remotely via the Web.  They allow up to 2 hours viewing time per month, but with grandparents that live 7 hours away, 2 hours won't get them through a month. So, if you decide to get this, then pay the $ and allow grandparents to experience the child's life while they still can.I began to worry when I noticed one of the requirements, as listed on their box, is a ""steaming"" internet connection.  This shows a lack of attention to detail and poor quality assurance; I would have immediately put this thing back on the shelf and walked away after reading a typo like that on product packaging.  How good could it really be if this is how they're marketing themselves?  But, this was given to us as a gift; so, I tried it out.  My fears worsened after I began to read the included manual - my 9-week old son could produce a better technical document than what they put out...I was embarrassed for them.I installed the software on my desktop, and was able to get it working after some trials & tribulations with my firewall.  However, the web cam software (mpeg4decoder.exe) crashes consistently, taking Windows Explorer down with it.  I decided to try the software on my laptop to see if it worked any better on a different computer.  Upon installation, Avira AntiVir identified the webcam software as a backdoor server (BDS/Hupigon.Gen).Also, the software can only be installed on one computer.  We would like to use it on our desktop on occasion, so I can use my laptop to access the internet and view my son when I'm away on business.  We would also like to use it on the laptop downstairs, when my wife & I are both at home and viewing the MobiCam monitor downstairs, while baby sleeps upstairs.In summary:  buggy software needs to be fixed; questionable virus/backdoor distributed with their software; software should be allowed on multiple computers (e.g. iTunes); fix horrible writing & typos in your documentation and on your product packaging - show us you care about your product.",1
Summer Infant By Your Side Sleeper Portable Bedding,"Honestly, this co-sleeper is absolutely everything I could have wanted in a co-sleeper- expect that my baby girl refused to sleep in it. She wouldn't fall asleep in it so we waited until she was asleep to move her. Then, almost as if she had sensed a disturbance in the force, her eyes would pop open and she would wail until we moved her directly into bed with us. To be fair, I think she would have done this with any co-sleeper. Maybe other mamas and papas out there would have better luck with this co-sleeper. As for us? It's been sitting in our storage room with all the other expensive crap that we bought our little girl that she snubbed.",2
Waterproof Baby Bibs with Placemat for Boys &amp; Girls,"The Perfect Bib truly is the perfect bib &#8212; plus much more! Consisting of two separable pieces, the bib transforms from a small bib with a pouch to a full-length bib. The Perfect Bib has endless uses, limited only by your creativity.

"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","Unlike other brands i bought at big box store and returned, my five year old can easily buckle herself in. I could hardly get the other brand to unbuckle and release this one with ease.Love the cow print and the fact that my child can keep the same car seat for the next five years and be very safe.This seat cost more than double the others and is worth every cent!",5
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","This bra is amazing!!!  I've been using it for a month now and I have nothing bad to say about it.  You can tell a lot of thought went into the design of this bra.  The front zip closure makes it easy to get off and on throughout the day (I think you can tell by the picture that it's not going to be a flattering bra to wear all day, only wear it while pumping).  It takes me less than 1 minute to get all set up.  This is essential for any working mom who needs to multitask  while pumping.  I'm a 38C and I got the small.  I could be several sizes bigger or smaller and it would still adjust to fit.  Seriously buy it!  You won't be disappointed!",5
"Britax Head and Body Support Pillow, Iron/Gray","I bought this for my daughter because she a little over 6lbs and did not fit snug in her car seat. This helped out tremendously and kept her nice and snug. I don't use it anymore because my baby girl has grown a lot since then. But if you feel you need this for the same purpose I mentioned, then it will work well for you too.",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"I just bought this stroller to use while we're out of town for a wedding. I have a City Mini, which I love, but like everyone else, it's really bulky (even when folded up) and hard to carry around (we took the train to this city). I did a ton fo research on umbrella strollers b/c I didn't want to spend the same amount of money I did on our City Mini, nor want something that was flimsy and felt like it was going to break since our daughter is a big little girl. This, so far, is not only a really solid feeling umbrella stroller, but moves and handles very well. I'm pretty proud of myself for making this purchase and I have a feeling I'm going to end up using it a lot more than I think.If you're looking for storage, this isn't going to be the umbrella stroller for you, which I think defeats the purpose of an umbrella stroller anyway. It's also a little heavier than you would expect. But if you want a solid and maneuverable stroller for travel or quick trips out of the house, I think you'll really like this. I haven't yet needed to recline it, but I think it'll work great.  I'll definitely update this review if anything changes.",5
"Joovy Room&sup2; Portable Playard, Red","I just got my Purpleness Playard and my 9-month old twin girls love it!  I'm ordering another one now because I just realized that even if there is enough room for two to play, one ends up sitting on the other or taking her sister's toys.The fitted sheet is very soft and the playard is easy to assemble and pack up.  It's a bit heavy to carry around, but no problem if it's just to the car and back.When packing up the playard, make sure the lower bars are all further in than the upper bars.  It took me a few minutes to figure out why it wasn't folding properly the first time around and this was the problem.Funny, I read a review that mentioned that her mom said all old play pens were made this way.  My mom said the same exact thing when I showed her my new giant playard!",5
Towel Doll Country Mouse,"All four of my children have a Kathe Kruse towel doll. They are the best comforts ever and they are small enough to fit in your purse. I always buy two so we can wash one and still have one to use. We lost one of the Country Mouse dolls, so I need a new back-up. I would recommend any of these - just beware of the white lamb. That one will never be completely white again! Even with two.",5
"Boppy Cottony Cute 2-Sided Slipcover, Polka Stripe Green","I bought this cover so I could have a backup when my other cover got dirty.  Overall I really like it, and it serves its purpose (plus it has a cute pattern).  The only bad things I'd have to say about it is this:1. The cover is a little tight and it fits but it's hard to get on and I have to stuff the Boppy pillow into it to get it zipped shut (my other Boppy cover fits much better).2. I have two dogs with black hair and I'm constantly finding their dog hair stuck to my pillow and it's hard to get off because it really sticks to the cover for some reason.  My other cover doesn't seem to do this, just this one.",4
"Dr. Brown's 4 oz Natural Flow Baby Bottle, 3 Pack",Where should I begin? Did not help colic at all. Never hold in any position other than upright in a bottle bag or they leak. Hard to clean. Does not reduce spitup.Very sorry I wasted my money on these. They are a pain and not worth the extra money at all.,1
"Pearhead Canvas Handprint Wall Art Set, Blue","This kit is amazing.  We just made one as a birthday gift for Grandma and I plan to get another for our house.  What a beautiful way to capture memories and decorate at the same time.  I disagree with reviews that it doesn't have enough detail.  I like the simplicity of it.  By being clean and streamlined, it fits into our decor perfectly.  Also, I feel as though the basic design doesn't detract from the handprints themselves - they are the focal point.  Love it!",5
Construction Melamine Dinnerware Set,Love this dinnerware set for my 2 year old grandson - it's his favorite and I like how there are three sections to the plate plus the bowl.  He's all about trucks and loves looking for the truck hiding under his food!  Easy to clean and care for too.,5
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Swaddle Blanket 2 Pack, For The Birds","This is a great size blanket for swaddling.  I prefer the bamboo fabric, however, because they are much softer.  The blankets are thin and breath so your baby won't overheat.  This is a must have for any parent with an infant.",5
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Jumperoo,This is adorable. We bought it as a gift for our friends and they loved it. It does take up a LOT of space and doesn't fold or put away easily though.,5
Lillebaby 5 Position Everywear Baby Carrier - Organic - Earth Brown,"This was the second carrier that I purchased since my son was born. The first was the moby but i wanted a structured carrier as well, and went with the lillebaby. I soon realized my son, who is very tall for his age, was not comfortable in this carrier. He is actually average weight but it was really hard on my back carrying him as well. I kept thinking that I needed to reajust the straps which I did, but the carrier itself just wasn't wide enough for my big boy. And I'm a small mama (almost 5'3"" and 108 pounds) so I needed something with a lot more support. I got the Boba G2 and I LOVE it! And so does my LO. Even the Boba's fabric is thicker. Maybe if you have a smaller child, this carrier works, but not for us.",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"As the father of a four-month old daughter, and someone who has studied music from the age of 4, I was thrilled to play with this toy, and spent over 30 minutes playing with it myself. The sound quality isn't great -- it's true (think midi instruments from your standard cheap composition software), but the idea is fantastic. There are numerous songs, each with harp, piano, flute, french horn, and violin parts. You can listen to any combination of those parts on any song. Although it's a bit much for a four-month old, I'm sure she'll enjoy it as much (or more!) than I do.",5
Sweet Jojo Designs Musical Baby Crib Mobile - Vintage French Black Toile,"I was very disappointed with this item, especially for it costing almost $50 (with tax and shipping). It barely plays music, before it shuts off...and the music itself was not very loud. Sounds like a music box on it's last leg. We were not able to install it on the crib as the instructions stated and we had to ""rig"" it to make it stay. Not worth the money and I would not reccommend.",1
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We travel frequently and often host guests. Without a guest room, having this cot allows us to give her double bed and even her room at night to grandma and other guests. This bed is compact (slides under the regular bed at home; light to carry on plane; takes up half the room folded as an umbrella stroller) and comfortable enough for our daughter to sleep in as needed. Crib/toddler bed sheets fit it perfectly. We do need to pad it a bit with a blanket under her fitted sheet. It's also great for smaller toddlers because it cradles a bit -meaning that rolling out would be near impossible. I only wish it were a little longer so that she could sleep in it as she gets older, but I am sure there are similar products out there for older kids. That said, my kid is 4 and 90th percentile, and I think she's got a good 6+months of use left with it.",5
Bearington Baby Posh Dots Crib Blanket (Blue),"Gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous. So soft, beautiful colors, washes nicely and doesn't shed. I couldn't say more good about it.",5
"Britax Kick Mats (2-Pack, Black)",Work great fit nice and tight.  Keeps the back seats nice and clean.  Prevents the leather from being tore up from the kids boots,5
Graco 1 Second Ear Thermometer,I rated this a three only b/c I think it reads lower than what the baby's temp actually is. It is nice that it reads so fast vs the typical thermometer that you use on a baby and try to keep them still for that long...IMPOSSIBLE.,3
Aden and Anais UpAwaySwddleBlnkts,"These blankets are the best and I only wish I'd had some for my first little one!  They are so soft, generously sized (which makes swaddling so much easier, if you choose to do that), and wash well (stains come out easily and no pilling or wash wear).  We've had ours for over a year now and have no complaints.  I was hesitant about the price but we use them every single day and hardly use any other blankets, although we throw a fleece on top of it now that it's cold out and the baby's sleeping in a larger crib.  My youngest spent her first 8 months sleeping by me in a rocknplay and I would fold this, lay it on top of her (and the restraint) and tuck it in around her (not over her arms).  She never got too hot or cold. They also work well for a nursing cover and you don't feel like you're in a sauna!  I had a set of 4 from Target, too, but they are not the same blanket.  These are so much better...softer and bigger!  One tip...if your diaper bag has Velcro at the opening be careful putting the blanket in and taking it out so it doesn't snag.  If you don't actually need to Velcro your bag shut you can get an extra piece to cover the rough half and not worry about this.",5
babyletto Modo 3 Drawer Dresser Changer in Espresso/White,"I know it's tempting - it has a nice modern design, and it's hundreds cheaper than the designer ones you've been admiring. Here's the thing, though - it's complete effing garbage. As many other reviewers have pointed out, it's made almost completely out of particle board. (I have two other pieces of furniture in my nursery from IKEA, and I consider both to be of much better quality than this.) The drawers make a wretched scraping sound when you open them, and the top one is visibly crooked - with seemingly no possible adjustments to correct the problem. Yeah, to most onlookers, it looks nice from across the room. Unfortunately, when *you* look at it from across the room, you'll probably just feel really disgusted about what you spent on it.",1
"Kushies Flushable Biodegradable Diaper Liners, 100 Sheets","These liners are ok - they do the job, but they're pretty big (on our 11 month old) and fairly stiff. I found I could wash the wet ones once (sometimes twice) and hang to dry; they get softer and thinner, but still work again. I like the Bummies liners much better, and I'm using those from now on.",2
Philips AVENT 3-in-1 Electric Steam Sterilizer,Very easy to leave saturated for hours/days at a time. If you're wife is able to breast feed consistently it's easy to forget the back up. Over saturated bottles left for 10 hours can't be any more sanitary than washed and properly stored bottles+ .. everything else.,3
Britax B-Nimble Mosquito Net,"Perfect for Macclaren stroler. Others I have seen are  very bulky, this one is very nice looking. Easy to install.",5
"Lamaze Cloth Book, Panda's Pals",My child is under 6 months but still loves this book. He smiles while turning the pages. Giving this item 3 out of 5 starts because one of the pick-a-boo flaps was sewn to the binding and we can not view the bears that would be hiding under the log. Other than that its baby approved.,3
"The Safe Sporter Water Bottle, Blue, 16 Ounce",This is a great water bottle for kids and doesn't leak! Perfect for 3-8 year olds. A sturdy and strong bottle.,5
"Safety 1st LED Nightlight, 2 Count","I love these nightlights.  They provide enough light without blinding you at night, and the light sensor for when to come on is good.",5
Under The Nile Strawberry Toy,My grandson loves these.  They are easy to grip and hold.  I don't worry if he puts it in his mouth knowing that they are made from organic material.  He also is learning what veggies and fruits are!!,5
"Kidz Delight Silly Sam the Broom and Dustpan with Larry the Talking Vacuum, Green",A must have for your little one who loves to sweep and vacuum like you do. My little one loves this and helps me a lot,5
Safety 1st Bath Toy Bag,Holds up very well.  Haven't had it drop like my previous toy holder (the frog).  But I do need to say that it gets stinky after a short while.  It starts smelling like a damp towel... you have to take it down and wash it.  I sprayed it with oxiclean and put it in the washer --- then I tumble dried it.,4
Mother-Ease Bedwetter Training Pants (Medium (55-65 lbs)),"Ordered for my 3 1/2 year old son. He stays dry in the daytime but soaks overnight diapers several times week. His sheets could no longer handle the daily washings so I put out the $30 hoping for a miracle.The pro's: highly absorbent (think swamp butt) and could double as a jock strap/cup as he repeatedly hit himself in the groin and buttocks...cause he could.The con's: very large...like reverse mushroom large. Comically large. Sort of like clown underpants. But he liked that part so maybe that's a pro(?). Secondly they were peed in within an hour and they must have been VERY absorbent that he didn't say anything! He was fine sitting in them which could mean they are no good as a trainer, or i'd better start buying new sheets!",3
Sesame Street Elmo Adventure Potty Chair,"My Granddaughter loves Elmo so this was a hit, likes to flush it, can remove the yellow part, not a big issue. Wish me luck with her training.",5
VTech Communications Safe &amp; Sound Digital Audio Monitor with two Parent Units,"Units were flawless...until we unplugged the monitor piece to move it in the room. After that, they would never sync and both monitors always said ""NOT LINKED"". Nothing I tried got them to work. Contacted VTECH and they sent out a new unit. That worked great (a few months) until tonight, my wife unplugged the monitor as we reorganized our daughter's room. Big Mistake. ""NOT LINKED"" again, both units. HELLO, VTECH? What is the problem? Why do you keep manufacturing and selling junk? I would NOT recommend buying this item because eventually, it will fail and there is no way to fix it. Stick to another brand.2/11/14 Update: I just received the second replacement set and they're working properly (they should). Props to VTECH for replacing mine a second time. I really like them when they work, but just worry the next time they die, they won't be replaced. Something like baby monitors should last at least 4-5 years in my opinion, especially the very light use we give them: All 3 pieces stay where they are and are never moved (until we rearrange a room and unplug them to use a different outlet).",2
One Step Ahead Secure Transitions Inflatable Baby Tub,"Unfortunately, my son loves this tub.  I say ""unfortunately"" since we are now on our 4th one.  I love the fact that it is large enough to accommodate a 30 lb, 33"" toddler and an ample supply of toys.  The tub, however, seems to have a life span of a few months before springing a leak.  The holes usually occur on the seams and the included patch does not seem to hold well.  I've even tried a heavier-duty patch kit with no luck.  I don't think my son is overly hard on the tub, these leaks just seem to happen with normal use.  If it was sturdier, it would be perfect!  I haven't experienced any issues with the bottom being slippery and I really like the thick sides.  My son will even lean back and rest his head on the side to have his hair rinsed.  I've tried other tubs, both hard plastic and inflatable, but my son refused to even get in them - and for now, peaceful bathtime = happy mom!",4
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"I bought this after reading the great reviews online. When I received it, it was very easy to put together (well, I watched while my hubby did it - but it looked like it was super easy). Trying it out, it was just low enough for my 4 month old munchkin to reach with her tippy-toes but she hated it at first. After introducing it several times, it started to grow on her and she began playing.A good thing about this jumper is that it has the bright colors and a variety of things for your baby to look at. However, there is 3 of the same item: spinning things that make noise. After playing with one for a while, my baby isn't so interested in playing with the other 2 even if I spin them to get her attention. Additionally, some of the items just hang and are pretty much stuck to the jumper - meaning if your baby is developing, she/he will more than likely want to touch and taste everything but can't do this. With even one animal facing away from her, she gets really upset trying to pull each one toward her without success.There is actually only 1 item on this thing that your baby will be able to pull on and bring to her/his mouth. Although it has soft wings, the body is a hard plastic, so whenever your baby pulls it spastically (which most young enough will have the classic flailing arms)it either clinks against the jumper's side or smacks your baby in the face - which has happened many times with my baby (It's only funny until she starts crying). The good thing about this item is that it can be removed and washed (and so can the seat cover, thank goodness).SUMMARY: Bright and colorful, my baby happily does her little ""plies"" on this thing. However, I don't really think it was worth the money we paid (especially since it's much cheaper now - boooooo!), considering the unexciting attachments. I think you can find something close to this and your baby would love it just as much.",2
"Summer Infant Fox &amp; Friends Classic Comfort Wood Bassinet, Espresso Stain","I ordered this in January for my grand baby . When it was put together, it was missing the bottom basket storage. My daughter has tried calling the company over and over and no one will return her calls.she has sent emails with no answer. This is very upsetting. She does love the bassinet. Just wish we could get all the parts.",2
Lamaze Indigo Stroller - Grey/Black,I am so excited about this stroller have wanted this for so long had the peg perego p3 for several months but not what I wanted. So happy and cant wait to use this tommorow. With my 11.5 month old.,5
"Prince Lionheart Seat Neat, Black/Grey",Fits and covers my chairs under my boys boosters.  Wipes clean easily very happy with the purchase it's definitely protecting my chairs!,5
Shark SwimFin Blue,"Best customer service! Did not have any problems once so ever . Aleays kept me updated on my shipments status. And what's best about purchasing swimfins from """"swim with coach X"""" is that he has different variety of colors ! This is a great product I use it to help kids and adults to swim .",5
"Bumkins Disney Baby Waterproof Super Bib, Princess, 6-24 Months, 2 Count","We use these bibs everyday on our daughter.  We clean them with the dishes and just hang them to dry.  We throw them in the wash every weekend and are safe to put in the dryer as well.  Since they are a thin plastic material, they keep all the wet and messy stuff off our daughter's clothes.  The designs are cute too!",5
"The Peanut Shell Baby Sling, Quincy, Small","It is harder to use then I thought. It took several attempts but once I finally got my daughter inside she started crying. I tried it a few other times and she cries every time. She is 7 weeks old now and I'm hoping she will like some of the other carrying positions when she gets bigger. I do really like the pattern and feel of the fabric, however its a little bit big on me. I got a small and I'm 119lbs and 5'3. I would recommend this to someone who already knows their baby will like it but keep in mind its not as easy to use as it looks.",4
"Bumkins Waterproof Splat Mat, On The Go","This mat is perfect as it's very easy to clean and doesn't attract static electricity or food to itself. But I wish the manufacturer made them twice this size as a toddler sitting on a highchair would surely try their best throwing power and I always have to clean up around this mat instead of inside of it. Very good concept, but doesn't work well for my son!",4
Summer Infant Day and Night Handheld Color Video Monitor with 1.8&quot; Screen - Silver,"Just returned this to amazon.  If you're going to buy this make sure that you don't have any other 900Mhz wireless technologies around, or it won't work, as I found out the hard way.Otherwise it has a decent picture and sound. Camera is very light due to the plastic construction.  I'm going to buy the interference free kind.  Hope this helps.",3
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"We have a couple of gates that are made similar to this one (metal, walk through).  We bought this one for the bottom of our stairs.  The opening is 30"" and no matter how we positioned it would not fit.  Luckily we have a one step landing and another opening before the actual flight of stairs which is the same width as the stairs (I'd say around 31-32"") and it does fit there.  It's not the ideal place as I'd really like to keep our baby off the landing as well, but it serves the most important purpose which is keeping him from going up all the stairs.The door to the gate is a little trickier than the other two that we have.  It just doesn't quite seem to line up properly, and we've readjusted the position of the gate, etc.I do like the extender kit that comes with it incase we ever want to use it on another door.  It seems sturdy and good enough for the price.",4
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"Seriously, I LOVE my stroller frame. It is small enough to take anywhere and fit in almost any vehicle. It;s easy to open and close and very lightweight but durable. My son was BIG and heavy. 14 pounds at 2 months old. This stroller was awesome, sturdy and reliable. The large basket underneath was great. I even put groceries in it when I had to get just a few things at the store. This stroller is best used for quick trips in the grocery store where u don't need a basket, the mall, office, outdoor fairs, parades, museums, walks on sidewalks or smooth roads. That's what I used it for and it was a Godsend! I don't recommend it for beaches, rocky trails, rough roads, or grass. Only fits with the 2-3 carseats they list. I unfortuantely bought the snugride 32. The carseat itself was great, but my son surpassed the weigh limit by 5 months old, although most babies prolly won't. I would recommend to all mothers to by the infant carseat with the 30 pound weight limit, not the 22 pound one. Good luck and enjoy your time with your baby while their still a baby! I sure did.",5
"Maxi Cosi Pria 70 Convertible Car Seat, Sweet Cerise","What more could you ask for. Its so easy to take my daughter in and out of this car seat. It doesn't get super hot in the sun, and isn't freezing in the winter. It is the very best all around. I would recommend this to everyone with a baby.",5
"3 Sprouts Storage Bin, Monkey","Nice big tote, stands on its own.  Packed flat, wrinkles may last for a while due to the thick canvas.  Exactly as in pictures, ribbon a tiny bit brighter in person.  Surprisingly large, will hold a large playground ball, Bumpo, Boppy, and other big items no problem.",5
"Bebe Dubon Fresh Fruit Feeder, 6 Months, Colors May Vary","These are so messy!  I like the idea of my baby eating on her own, but to me it's not worth the cleanup. Not only does she get the food, especially banana, all over herself through the mesh, but that mesh is extremely difficult to clean and needs to be replaced often.  I used mine once or twice and never again!",2
Pop-Up Mosquito-Net Crib,It's a good product for the price. It's not for long term use maybe for a vacation or two and it's over,4
"The First Years 1 Pack Breastflow Bottle, 9 Ounce","I loved these bottles. After starting to lose my sanity breastfeeding my baby seemingly around the clock (leaving very little time for my plans of world domination, let alone eating and combing my hair occasionally), we found these bottles. They are wonderfully compatible with breastfeeding! The two nipple design means baby really has to suck to get milk out, which helps when you want to avoid nipple confusion. My newborn was always a bit fussier at the breast after drinking from faster-flowing bottles, but once we got these bottles he was fine. He latched on perfectly well after using these bottles, no confusion at all. Since they worked so well, I started pumping to make a couple of bottles, and my husband was able to take a night time feeding shift, which was fantastic! Not only did these bottles allow me to get a little more sleep (alleluia!), they gave my husband that nice feeding bond with baby. 10 enthusiastic thumbs up (and never you mind why I have 10 thumbs).",5
"Pinzon Baby By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Wild Thing",These are my absolute favorite blankets- even softer than the other aden & anais blankets I purchased on Amazon. I just wish they had more patterns available.,5
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"This is one of my most favorite baby products.  My son loves it too.  He went through the separation axiety phase a little early and when I wasn't able to put him down, my arms would feel like they were going to fall off.  With the carrier I am able to do the dishes and the laundry and keep him happy all at the same time.  He loves to dance with mommy, too, so I just put him in the carrier and dance with him that way.  When he was younger, sometimes that would be the only way that I could put him to sleep.  Also, I always seem to be cold, so having him in the carrier, right next to my chest, was a really inexpensive way to keep warm.  Oh, and when we go out shopping we can carry him around in the carrier instead of having to lug a big stroller everywhere.  If there were more stars I would definitely give more.  I also love the fact that it's machine washable and it's easy to use.  It doesn't take you 30 minutes just to put it on.",5
Dorel Juvenile Cabinet Lock (Set of 2),"THESE LOCKS ARE AWFUL.  I'm so glad that I'm not the only one who thinks so because these are so hard to use.  I had to struggle to get them open to begin with, and it took like almost 10 minutes to wrestle it off of my cabinet after I put it on. Such a waste of money.",1
"Dappi Waterproof 100% Nylon Diaper Pants, 2 Pack, White, Small","We are potty training my son and I ordered the size according to his weight. They are HUGE! They contain accidents somewhat but they leak a lot since they are so big. Since I ordered 6 of these, I will be keeping them. Maybe they work better if you order a smaller size.",2
"BabyHawk Mei Tai Baby Carrier, Black/Lime Motifs","I used this to cook dinner, do yardwork, laundry, grocery shopping. Totally worth the money because it makes my life and his much more pleasant.",5
Nuk Replacement Spouts - 2 Pack Soft Silicone Clear,It is good to find replacements for the cups that are still good.  Happy to have found these replacement spouts online.,5
Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball,"We have had this for a month and my 7 month old plays with it every other day. She is fascinated by all the moving parts and really enjoys playing with the ball at the top. She will hold it and shake it and turn the frog in the middle for AAAGGEES. Great pruchase, highly recommend!",5
Sesame Street Fire Department 4 Piece Set,"Set looks nice, however it gets only 2 stars from me since it is 100 polyester. Web site description specify 55% cotton and 45% polyester.If you don't care, I would say go for it as set looks nice. But for my Elmo fan this would be too warm and he will not be able to sleep in without sweating.. so this goes back.Amazon gets a thumb down on this one.. very disappointed. Btw, it is the second time this happened.. Had the same problem when purchased ""Sesame Street Construction Zone 4 Piece Toddler Set"" and again received a 100% polyester product, despite the description.",2
"Bright Starts Start Your Senses Safari Activity Gym, Spots and Stripes","We purchased this for our 9 week old daughter.  She LOVES it! Other toys we have introduced her to have kept her attention for a couple of minutes at most, but this activity gym holds her attention for up to 30 minutes.  She starts smiling and giggling as soon as we put her on it.  She especially loves the tiger that lights up and plays music, but she also really enjoys batting at the chime and rattle.  My husband and I have almost as much fun watching our daughter enjoy this toy as she does playing with it.  I would definitely recommend this to others!",5
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","I love this chair. It's so portable, light, easy to use and convienent. I love that the straps hold everything together for transport plus a shoulder strap to keep your hands free. The adjustable height is great for resturants too. I will definatly be getting another for my 6 month old soon. My toddler likes the fact that I can put it in the living room floor and he can color and watch TV at the same time and I dont have to worry about him coloring on furniture.",5
"Britax Roundabout 55 Convertible Car Seat, Isabella","Comparing this to a Graco car seat, this one is much easier to get our 16 month old into and out of.",5

Saria bidet spray converts toilet into a bidet [Misc.],It was easy to install and it works very nice not too much pressure. I like it a lot.,5
"Cosco - Scenera 5-Point Convertible Car Seat, Renaissance","We bought this because it had good reviews and it was cheap. If I could go back in time, I'd just spend more money for a nicer one.My biggest complaint is the cheap fabric. It has no padding, and so it looks really uncomfortable for my little one, especially now that we've had it for a long time. The fabric is falling apart, and is actually discolored from sun damage. Granted, our car is in the sun most of the time. But even if that wasn't true, this fabric would fall apart pretty fast.Now, I'm in the market for a car seat with a 5-point harness that can switch to a booster since my little girl will be big enough for a booster within six months or so. I'm also going to look for a seat that will hold her head better when she falls asleep.I've had to travel with it, and taken it on an airplane. The airplane buckles are so bulky and stop right in the middle of her back. With the non-existant padding, it really bothered her. So frustrating. I learned to bring a blanket as a cushion, and loosened the straps for her. (I figure, if we get in an airplane accident, we'll probably all die anyway. What good comes from being uncomfortable too.) This wasn't a problem in the car.",1
Nature's Lullabies Second Year Sticker Calendar,"I only purchased a second-year calendar for my son because I had one for my daughter. I was really disappointed with the lack of selection available for second-year calendars in general, so I just got this one because it was one of the only ones. It's an okay calendar. The finish on the pages is glossy which makes it hard to write on with certain pens. The stickers aren't very cute and the pages are pretty old-fashioned looking. Hopefully they will come out with some other calendars for future purchasers.",2
"Brica Car Seat Grabber, Black",It keeps the back part of the seat clean. Wish it was long enough in the front that it would go over the seat. My son steps up to his chair and it doesn't fully cover the seat for my car.,3
Star Light Snoopy Fabric - By The Yard,"The fabric on the Amazon Website was listed as ""Star Light Snoopy Fabric""  i.e. Baby Snoopy. What I received was the ""Snoopy Argyle"" Fabric pattern instead.  The fabric that was shipped definitely was NOT what was pictured on the Amazon Website.  Although the Snoopy Argyle Fabric was nice, it was NOT what I ordered so I was a little surprise that a substitution was made without notifying me.  That's the reason for the low rating.",2
"Safety 1st Designer Infant Car Seat Base, Black",Fits my Eddie Bauer infant carrier perfectly. Makes switching between vehicles much easier.  I would recommend to those debating whether it is worth it to purchase an additional base to do so. Much easier!,5
Safety 1st Clear Tip Nasal Aspirator,I love being able to open this up and clean it easy. It always made me nervous with the bulbs you could not see in if it was really getting clean. I don't have to worry with these :D,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","Only reason it's no 5 stars is because it doesn't &#34;lock&#34; in place when folded out for sleeping. I worry that my 2 year old isn't enough weight to keep it from trying to fold up again. But it's a great size, wonderful construction and the carrying case is fabulous! After first use, my daughter ended up on the floor (she may have crawled off herself), but it wasn't too far of a drop to wake her up. Takes up same floor space as a standard crib mattress, so make sure you've got room where you're going to put it. Perfect for light use and traveling!",4
"Britax Pavilion 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat Seat, Biscotti",We have used this car seat for about 1 year.  Today the top part of the plastic chest Hug system snapped right off the strap. I will have to cut off the bottom part because otherwise the jagged piece on top is flapping and twisting near my child's chin!!  We have 21 month old twin boys that are in the 20% percentile for their weight.  It has always been a challenge to loosen and tighten the straps.  I have to pull so hard.  We have the Diono car seats in our other vehicle and would highly recommend them for ease of use and durability.,1
"Graco Backless TurboBooster Seat, Galaxy","Very easy to set, great price and have two water or drinks cup holders. The color (lucky me) is almost the same color as my car upholstery  so it matches nicely. Higly recommend.",5
"Real Nappies Potty Training Pants, White, Medium, for toddlers 30-40 lb","My son is 2 years and 11 months, 32 pounds, and 36.5 inches tall. I got size medium (30-40 lbs.) These were so tight in the legs I couldn't even pull them up. I have no idea how well work since I couldn't even get them on my son.I would not recommend these training pants.",1
P's &amp; Q's Chewy Tube Orange,My daughter was delayed in chewing effectively and this was recommended to me. She is doing great now and still loves to chew on them because she is teething. The Q is great because doesn't seem dangerous for her to walk with in her mouth. She loves the P too but I only like her using that sitting down.,5
Tadpoles Three Bulb Chandelier in Black Onyx,"Just what we were looking for to add to my daughter's newly decorated room. Price was great, shipping was super-fast and item is very cute.  Only bad thing was that one of the dangles had broken off or come de-tached.  I was able to fix this with some super glue and needle-nose pliers in about 15 minutes but it was a bit annoying.  This is why I only gave 4 stars.",4
Munchkin Dora The Explorer Toddler Dining Set,"Again, my grandson is 9 months old and I am having an Elmo theme party for his birthday. What's better than eating  from your own Elmo dining set on his1st birthday.",5
"Kids Line Luxury Blanket, Pink",This is a wonderful blanket thick and soft well made excellent material! Will buy more for baby shower! I love it and the baby use it everyday!,5
"Summer Infant Ultra Plush Change Pad Cover, Blue","my kid likes a warm and and snuggle place to change her, so tried to change her on just the plastic and it was to cooled for her so i bought this cover! it easy on easy off and easy to wash !",5
BEABA First Stage Spoon Multi-Pack - Multicolor - 4 pk,"I absolutely LOVE these spoons. They are made with silicons. They are soft and safe for your baby's feeding items. The spoons are in solid one piece and you will not have any problem washing them like you do with two pieced spoons (like the one with metal spoon with silicon cover on the bowl part). There are no gap for the foods to get stuck! so, it is very sanitary :) The weight is not light but not heavy. It is more on the heavy side but that is great because you dont have any problem finding on the bottom of the dishwasher when you wash. (like, when you try to wash a plastic spoon, they fly inside of the dishwasher and you find it on the bottom :( anyways, this spoon is soft and very gentle when you scoop up some foods off from baby's face. I absolutely love it and I dont have any complain about it. It is expensive but it worth the money!",5
Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump,"My wife has been complaining that pumping has somewhat become painful because the flanges leave a mark after a 45-minute session.  This set, however, eased some of that pain because it comes with a soft silicone shield.  She prefers this over the Medela manual pump.",5
Samsung SEW-3036WN Wireless Video Baby Monitor IR Night Vision Zoom 3.5 inch,"This product are better than expected. Great image, great sound! The coast is little high but the quality of product value!",5
"Munchkin Two Snack Catchers, Colors May Vary",The only thing I don't like about these cups are their size...my toddler can eat everything in it in like a minute then is screaming for more.and the rubber flaps that prevent messes on the top tend to bend and open up more after being in the dishwasher (top rack) a few washes. but we are still using the 2 we bought and I am actually online to buy 2 more :)I was thinking about getting that Munchie Mug but i think I will let his nani and pop pop shell out the [...] bucks for me to try it :p Til then it's these handy dandy things!,4
Set of 2 Car Side Window Sun Shade Visors,"The plastic suction cups are too small for the sliver rings on the shade itself. The shade falls off leaving the suction cup on the window. Also, one of the rings ripped and now I have one useless shade. Poor Design.",2

"Tommee Tippee Explora Easi Roll Bib, Pink and Purple, 2 Count","I purchased this bib set from a local store and, although I have never bought any other Tommee Tippee brand items, I decided to give these a try.  I have a clip-on booster seat for my daughter so there is no tray like with tradition high chairs.  Food constantly fell between picking it up off the table and getting it in her mouth.  I had a few of the thinner pocket style bibs, but the pockets do not stay open, so they are kind of pointless.  These bibs catch just about everything that falls!!  They are the perfect design to not be too bulky and stay in place where you need the pocket to be.Easy on/off with little buttons built in on the back of the neck, I have not had an issue with the rubber material bothering her neck or chatching her hair.Easy clean...I just wipe with soap and water and hang to dry.  It says dishwasher safe, but I have never tried that. I have not had a problem with stains and my daughter eats a variety of colors...blueberries, spinach, pumpkin...no problem!Easy to pack away/take with you....just rolls up into it's own pocket and slips into your diaper bag.  Roll the mess up if need be and it will stay contained until you get home to clean it.Other bonus feature....my teething daughter loves to chew on the edges of the bib while waiting and it seems to be the perfect feeling for her gums!!Only downfall....the neck opening (even on the smallest hole) can be too big on my little baby for some messy foods.  If she is feeding herself something messy it tends to get on the top of her shirt at the neck, so I started putting a small cloth bib on first, then this bib to catch the dropping food.  Not a big deal, and she will obviously be able to grow into this bib for quite a while with all the additional button holes.",5
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Value Jersey Knit Fitted Portable/Mini Sheet, Celery","Fits good, is soft, and stays on well.  Not much more one can say about such a small product.  Quality seems OK.",5
"Philips AVENT ISIS Manual Breast Pump, White","The Avent Isis breast pump works really well, if it fits you. Breasts come in many different sizes, and as few as 10% of women fit this size, approximately 25mm, well enough to get adequate milk transfer. Also, the silicone insert (for let-down stimulation) on the flange may cause irritation and pulling on the breast, as well as reduces the size of the breast flange further.The best option is to get a pump where you can change the flange custom fit to your breasts, which could mean a different size for each breast. The Medela Harmony hand pump allows you to do this, with many sizes of replacement breast flanges available, and is similarly priced.",4
Baby Trend Sit N Stand Double Stroller - Millennium,Over all it's a great stroller for a decent price. Only complaint is that it's a little difficult to fold down.,4
Sassy Ring O' Links Rattle Developmental Toy,"This is the weirdest thing, but for some reason this turned out to be the BEST toy! I can make a chain to string across his seat, turn it back into a rattle, use a few links to put other dangling toys into reach... At 3.5 months he grabbed it, then started to chew it, and now at 5 months he can pull the links off for a great gnaw. Clear, bright colors and interesting textures make this even more attractive. We flew to Australia and back... and this toy kept him well-entertained. I really didn't need to waste diaper bag space with any other toys for the trip!",5
Eshop 12 Pcs 2 1/4'' Ickel Plated Blanket Pins + Eshop Cable Tie,"A traveling nurse at my hospital told me about these things for attaching things like bandage scissors, hemostats, tape, etc to your scrubs.  As all nurses know, pocket space is limited and bulky items like these don't fit, yet you need to have them on you when you need them and not have to go hunting for them.  I am an OR nurse and I wear hospital issued scrubs and i will say that these leave a little hole wherever they are inserted and since I don't wash my own scrubs or ever see any given pair again I can't say if this hole disappears after they are washed or not, so you may use caution the first time you use them on your own scrubs.  Since they came in a pack of 6 I have backups and i will probably find tons of other uses for them around the house.  Several other nurses asked me about them when they saw mine and said that they used to use them but hadn't been able to find them in years.  I even ordered a second pack for some of them...so glad that Amazon had these!",5
Billy Bob Teeth/two Front Teeth/pacifier,ALL MY FRIENDS WITH CHILDREN WANTED THESE AFTER I BOUGHT THESE FOR ONE FRIEND! Hilarious. Definitely worth the cost! For sure!,5
"SwaddleDesigns Terry Velour Hooded Towel, Brown Mod Circles, Pastel Pink","good quality, sturdy, washes well, but definitely not plush, thick or soft, which is what I was hoping for. Very thin. But it does look exactly as pictured, so as long as you're aware of these other aspects, you won't be disappointed.",3
Cloud b Baby Sheep with Quiet Rattle,"A sad looking, dull sounding rattle.The colors are not bright and the rattle requires a vigorous shaking to be able to hear it.",1
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium","Our little boy is such a wiggler even the nurses at the hospital couldn't keep him swaddled.  We were holding his arms and legs still to get him back to sleep in the middle of the night until we bought this.  Now he sleeps from 11-6 just about every day!  We bought the large for him and it works very well, he is 3 months old, 13 pounds.",5
Baby Elephant Ears Head Support Pillow (Black Dot),"This was a good find. The only thing I wish it had was someway of connecting onto the car seat so it didn't move around. It's very plush and cozy. It fit well behind my daughters head and she seemed to like it. It should make long trips a little better when sleepy time rolls around. So far, So good!",4
"Lifefactory 2 Pack Multi Sensory Silicone Teether, Sky/Spring Green","These teething rings are a God-sent. I purchased the pack of 2 in Pink/Lilac. They are in a pretty pastel-colour.My baby has had no problems grabbing them and using them since she was about 4 months. They are very flexible and in a safe material, easy to wash and convenient to bring along on our trips.I'm thinking of even getting another pack of 2 in other colours! So glad I made this purchase, no regrets at all.",5
"Kushies Washable Nursing Pads, White","These pads are my least favorite of the three kinds I have. They crumple after washing, show through clothes, and are not very absorbant. Since I paid for them, I use them at night. Go for something made out of jersey knit instead.",1
Furniture Wall Straps (Set of 2),"It took about an hour for me to install this - mostly because I was trying to keep my son from eating the screws. If he wasn't there, it would probably be about a 20 minute install. My only 'complaint' is that I had to use other screws than what it came with. This isn't really a 'complaint' for me, but I figured it could be for other people. Very satisfied with the durability and strength of this product. I am feeling much better about our dressers now.",4
"Charlie Banana 10 Reusable Organic Cotton Wipes,  (Pack of 2)","We love these!  We have a supply to use as wipes and a supply to use as washcloths.  Very soft and they wash very nicely.Update 12/10/11:  They still hold their shape after being washed three times a week for almost one year.  They are not nearly as soft as they once were.  That is unfortunate, but expected after so much use.  We use them wet, so it is not a problem for us.  I still recommend these reusable wipes for anyone that is cloth diapering.",5
"My Little Seat Infant Seats, Blue Fish",Bought this infant seat for a hand-me-down Chicco high chair that arrived without the straps. It fits great and keeps my grandson safe while in the high chair.  We look forward to using it at restaurants and when visiting family and friends that do not have high chairs.,5
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","I have a 1 year old and a 2 year old who constantly were getting into everything no matter how much we baby-proofed... I set this up  differently than the pictures shows... I made a long rectangle and a smaller square portion to prevent tipping. It is great. I bought some of the bright color padding on amazon and the kids actually get excited to go into the play yard! Love the ivory color as it looks nice in the living room. I bought the 8 panel play yard. More than happy with this purchase! Both of my children have plenty of room to play and now I do not have to chase my kids around 24/7. Definitely worth the investment, it has really made life easier!",5
Planetwise Flannel Wipes,"These flannel wipes are OK, but in my opinion not worth keeping.  I also ordered someImse Vimse Cloth Wipes-Ocean Blue-12 countwhich are larger, had a nicer, softer texture and just seemed higher quality.  I use cloth wipes for hands and faces and have been usingThirsties 6 Pack Fab Wipes, Boyfor about 8 months now and need to replace them because they are starting to get rough and have had stink issues for a while that stripping no longer handles.",3
Pediatrician Designed Infant (Newborn Baby) and Toddler Healthcare and Grooming Kit,"I love this product! It is a great help for being a first time mom.  I remember once I called my doctor because I thought my baby's tummy was expanding, I was able to use the tape measurer in the kit and tell him how big her tummy was and re measure to compare and give the doctor more accurate results... also gave a few kits to my friends for their baby showers.. it was a hit:)",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My husband and I selected the Diaper ""Champ"" mainly because you can use ordinary trash bags and not be roped into buying the specialty refill bags, and it was moderately priced (a little less than the Diaper Dekor). It also seemed that the reviews of this product were generally more positive...The positives are:1. You can use any trash bag2. Easy to use and refillThe negatives are:1. The bag doesn't seal around the dirty diapers, so when it comes time to refill the bag, it's just like opening a regular trash can. Smells like the Champ is trying to knock YOU out with odor!2. The plastic seems to smell, ie. You put a dirty diaper in the hole, and flip the handle to dump the diaper into the champ. That ""side"" of the plastic dumper-thingie is in contact with the air inside the dirty diaper changer, so when you flip it over the next time to dispose of another diaper, you smell the last 8 diapers you put in there...pretty gross.3. The ""odor seal"" (some soft material) really seems to retain odor. It cannot be washed or replaced, so after a while, the Diaper ""Champ"" smells even when freshly washed and deodorized (I'm talking about hosing down outside and scrubbing with Clorox cleanser!). Super-frustrating! This is my primary complaint.Okay, so some things are a given as far as disposal systems go (ie. *some* odor, must empty frequently, must wash and disinfect occasionally), but still I think this product leaves much to be desired.We're going to try another disposal system.",1
"Philips AVENT Washable Nursing Pads, 6-Count",These breast pads work great. The size and thickness was exactly what I needed. I would recommend these pads. I would definitely purchase them again.,5
The First Years Car Rear Sunshade,"This sun shade really helps. Our son cries when the sun is in his face too much in the car, so having the screen up makes the car experience much more pleasant for all of us. The screen doesn't cover the entire rear window though (thus 4 stars). It's pretty easy to see through for visibility.",4
"Tiny Love Take Along Mobile, Animal Friends","This was the first mobile our son cooed and smiled at. He really loves it. He doesn't always love the music, so that's hit or miss. But all in all, I highly recommend. The portability is also really nice.",5
Lightweight Double Umbrella Stroller By Lmntree - Grey (Brown),"quick delivery, great brand that has lasted me several Disney trips!  I couldn't be happier wit the ease of putting together.  It takes up no space. So easy to maneuver through stores and seats my 3 year old and 1 year old cozily.",5
Teething Toys - BPA Free - Baby Q Ribs Appeteether,This teether was practical in size & texture my baby doesn't like the water filled teething rings. Plus it looks hilarious to see her chewing like a caveman on a rib.,4
Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"when he was 2 months old he keeped kicking so we figured to put him in his jumperoo. He loves it because he is able to """"stand"""" on his own and he goes crazy with it. Hes only 4 months old now but he hasnt gotten tired of it yet. I believe its a good investment.",5
Built NY Tidy Bib Black/Leaf Green,"this product is great for my teething liitle 8 month old,water proof,little pocket to catch crumbs,Its great,very happy with my order!!!!",5
"PRIMO Folding Potty with Handles, White granite","The fit on the seat isn't intuitive, but other reviewers who described how to seat the front lip in front of the potty were very helpful.My son is 30 lbs., and the seat does bow in a little from his weight, but doesn't collapse entirely. For a boy, one should keep repeating, ""Point it down, point it down,"" because there is no splash guard for absent minded boy toddlers.I can see how a little tush might get pinched if the seat were not completely unfolded before he sat down, so it's important to make sure it's completely flat.The design of going over the front of the seat makes sense now, as it minimizes contact between those curious little hands and a dirty public toilet seat. I keep Lysol wipes in my pouch to clean the bottom side of the seat before folding it up and storing it again.It fits easily into a small diaper bag or a large purse. It's definitely something I want on hand on trips to friends' houses or public places.I wish it were a little sturdier and there were a good way to avoid the possibility of pinching, but I will say my 2 year old is particularly squirmy, and he hasn't fallen in or yelped in pain yet.The bottom line is, it is functional, although not perfect, and I would buy it again if I needed to replace it.",3
"Infantino Breathe Vented Carrier, Grey","I like this item but I just hope it works, I haven't tried it with the baby yet but it looks strong & durable.",4
"Ju-Ju-Be Packabe Diaper Bag, Brown/Champagne","Love my packabe! Others have complained about there not being a handle for carrying. I have fixed that problem and attached tiny zip ties (there are 2 hardware pieces that meet at the top) that keep the straps as a backpack and also forms a handle...works perfectly! & if you want the long handle, just snip the zip ties. Simple...perfect size and holds sippy cups great. This is a great bag for when you have 2 children and  you need to be hands free. Very durable fabric and liner and overall a great design.",5
New Native Baby Carrier: Black Small (chest size 30-33&quot;),"I agree with the two previous reviews, the small infant is engulfed in fabric and it doesn't seem safe.  A larger child doesn't seem to fit.  Also, everytime we squeezed my newborn into the carrier, he had a diaper blow out, probably due to the strange angle he was arranged in.  And, the merchant that sells this product for Amazon doesn't accept returns.  Buyer beware.",1
Jellycat Truffle Dog Large,"As an adult having given this puppy as a gift to another, I cannot vouch for its durability in the hands of young ones; however, this dog is the cuddliest ball of fur with a face that will melt your heart and bring a smile to your face.",5

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Blue Retro","We originally got the Baby Bjorn to carry him around when we are on the move. However, we discovered another use for the BabyBjorn carrier...it's a great way to soothe and calm a crying baby. Whenever our baby cries, we'd put him in the BabyBjorn and carry him around when we do work around the house. He quickly stops his crying and falls asleep.",5
Milk Bands Nursing Bracelet BLUE QTY: 1,"Hey, these are great!! I nursed all 5of my babies in past years. I got so tired and often confused with the shifting of the safety pin from one side to the other..or worse, forgetting to and messing up...remember, start nursing on the side you FINISHED on last feeding. Well this little band is a great, practically free investment! You can track side to start on as well as know when last feeding was...",5
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Backpack,"We were going to buy this but ended up getting it through our insurance but I wanted to post a review . This has a lot of parts but once you get the hang of it its pretty easy to use . I have even assembled it with one hand while holding the baby in the other :) . Its also pretty easy to use according to my wife, you have to hold it a certain way but once she got the hang of it , it was pretty easy.One word of advice , if you are planning on using this every day theres no putting it away ( we are using it to supplement the feedings by pumping in between )  . You are supposed to wash it after every use and it has to air dry so , wash put on a towel or rack to air dry  and by the time it dries you are probably ready to use it again. Since theres a lot of parts its easier this way rather than trying to put it away every time and risk loosing pieces.",4
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,"Everybody raves about this mixer and how it so easily removes lumps from formula. Perhaps that is true for large quantities, but it didn't apply to the smaller quantities we needed to make (4-8oz). The mechanism is flimsy and hard to clean. Our money was far better spent on BlenderBottles. Once you mix formula with them, you won't turn back.",2
One Size Fit All- Diaper Covers for Prefolds or Regular Inserts PUL - PINK,"This cover is stretchy and worth the buy. It holds up to our chubby baby's power pees! She blasts through disposables with little effort, but since switching to cloth (these were our first go at it) I have been pretty happy. They could use more of a gusset in the legs, and may not be suitable for a skinnier baby.Remember moms, the inserts that you will put into a cover like this need to be washed in HOT water at least 5 times to get to maximum absorbancy. If you just buy them and throw them on they won't work well. Make sure you do your homework.Great item for the price! We love em.",4
"Tadpoles Playmat Set, Blue/Cream/Taupe",This was something big enough for my baby to roll and learn to crawl on and now thats she is walking this thing dosent stay together. She loves taking it apart. It dosent have that chemical smell like most of the other mats you find in the stores and easy to clean!,5
Safe T Sleep Travel Sleepwrap Baby Swaddle for Cribs and Beds,"This is the BEST invention for helping non-sleeping babies to sleep through the night! I am not exaggerating when I say my husband and I never slept until we ordered and tried this with our, at the time 4 month old daughter. She had been colicky and was very difficult to get to sleep, keep asleep, etc. She would fall asleep and the minutes we laid her down she'd wake up. So it was musical beds for a month and a half. We'd start out in the swing for 2-3 hours then she'd wake and then it was the fisher price cradle rocker by me on the couch and then finally if hold her in out rocking recliner for the last leg of the night. It was madness and I was going crazy. Then she got too big for the cradle, bassinett, etc and so I decided to try her actual bed. Well by then she had started to roll and would wake herself up about an hour in and couldn't get herself back to sleep. We tried sleep training but wout some way of keeping her securely in place, it would NOT work. So we tried wedges galore, nothing worked. Got this and it worked from night one & on. She has slept 12-13 hrs a night since using the safety sleeper. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND. ITS AMAZING!! have baby sleeping trouble-order this and your baby will be sleeping through the night immediately. You may have to do some sleep training-letting them learn to self-soothe-lay down awake, bed routine/cues, but this thing works like gang busters man, best product we have for our baby hands down! Worth EVERY CENT! We got the one that has the extension. Makes travel EASY!! Works same but on any bed, couch, etc. Cannot express my gratitude and appreciation for this product. Baby does not overheat, doesn't confine the baby, it's breathable but warm, comforting and they can still move around just not roll over onto their tummy. Also you will sleep soundly knowing your child isn't crawling out of the bed as they get older. It's just the best thing since sliced bread!!! Can't say enough good things about this.A+++++++!!!!Abs",5

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Active, Black/Red","I purchased this carrier and found that once I returned to my pre-baby size it didn't fit.  I am 5ft and have a slight build.  I am not able to pull the straps tight enough to feel that my son is secure.  I am now on my third carrier and it seems to fit perfectly (The Ergo carrier original works, Red Castle Sport is also too big).  If you want to purchase this make sure you try it on and put a real baby into it.",1
"Under The Nile Under The NileBurp Cloths, White, 4-Count","We received a lot of burp cloths when our first baby was born - one pack was from under the nile, the rest were other brands (non-organic, cheaper). The under the nile material immediately felt softer than the others and, after a few washes, all of the other burp cloths started pilling. The under the nile burp cloths seemed to get even softer with each wash. We found ourselves digging through our pile of clean cloths looking for one from under the nile! We wound up buying another pack, and now that we're expecting our next baby, we have gotten rid of all of the other burp cloths. There is really no comparison, especially considering how many times a day we had to wipe our baby's soft, delicate face.",5
"Graco FastAction Fold Jogger Click Connect Stroller, Grapeade","I wife was dead set on purchasing this stroller.  I was less than pleased when I saw the original cost at other retailers.  So glad I drug my feet and purchased it here.  Arrived the next day and is a great stroller, very well made and solid.",5
The First Years Compass Deluxe Folding Booster Car Seat - Giraffe,"We were looking for a booster seat that my 5yo daughter and I could both agree on. I was concerned for safety since she would be giving up her Evenflo Triumph. She cared about appearence and comfort. My husband has an Evenflo big kid deluxe in his car, and it's okay for short trips. Long trips, which we make quite frequenty, she complained about the seat not being comfortable after awhile. I searched everywhere and found the Compass when I was looking at safety ratings. The seats are wider and plusher from everything else I've seen. Plus, I couldn't resist the adorable giraffe print, and that was a hit with my daughter as well. I also liked how the shoulder strap has a designated area where it goes through and across my daughters chest at the right angle, so she doesn't complain about the strap being so close to her neck. A common problem we have with my husbands booster!",5
"Waterproof Baby Bibs with Snaps for Girls &amp; Boys, Gift Box 10 Pack, Solid Colors",These are awesome - the snap closure keeps the little one from tearing it off his neck; the 10 pack means you always have one around; the terry on both sides with the waterproof insert means they are truly reversible and soft for little skin but effective at preventing drool-soaked clothing.  I love them.,5
Dr. Brown's 3-pack 8-ounce Standard Bottles,"I bought these bottle and Evenflo bottles when my son was born.  What a big difference.  With the Dr. Brown's my son had no problems with gas, burping, or anything.  They have more parts to clean, but it is a small price.  With the Evenflo bottles he kept gulping it to fast and would choke, he had the hiccups a lot and you could here the bottle making a ""vacuum"" noise.  After just two days, I threw away the Evenflo's and bought more Dr. Brown's and have had no problems.  My son had not problems going from breast to bottle.  Best buy ever.",5
Levana BABYVIEW20 Interference Free Digital Wireless Video Baby Monitor with Night Light Lullaby Camera,"We've used this monitor for about 5 months now. Contrary to some of the other reviews, I found the audio and video quality to be pretty good (I guess it depends how far away you install the camera). It's enough to see her face so I can reposition her if I don't like her sleeping angles. We paid closer to $200, it looks like it's $130 now.We did have a problem with the monitor's battery, but customer service was good and they resolved the issue.I would buy this item again.-Andrew",4
Safety 1st Space Saver Fold-Up Bath Tub,"This tub works fine.  It does not pose any safty hazard and is better than just puting baby straight into the tub, but be aware that it does have some problems.  Firstly, it is difficult to keep your baby (who cannot sit - which is the whole purpose of the tub) from drooping over to the side.  It also brags that it is a space saver, but to me that is like a bicycle advertising itself as a space saver simply because the basket on the handle bars is removable...in other words it is an exaggeration.  Lastly, after awhile, the bottom yellow pad starts peeling up and you can not get it to stick back down....I don't feel ripped off or anything, but I am having another baby now and replacing it with a better one.  This one won't even make it to the garage sale...it is going in the trash.",2
Play Wonder Dinnerware Set,"They are made of the most durable, thick plastic. Every toy should be made like this! My 3 and 6 yr old daughters play with them every day. Just two days ago they fashioned their own Thanksgiving dinner, complete with coordinated plates, saucers, bowls and cups from Play Wonder.",5
Disney Princess Castle Dreams 2-Piece Sheet Set,"She loved it.  Her favorite character.  Would order more like this.  You should also order these, your child will love it.",5
Svan Baby To Booster Bentwood High Chair - Natural,"I had planned to buy the Svan Anka, but it was discontinued, so we purchased the Bentwood.  We've been using it for 3 months now.  Pros:  small form factor, folds up and stores easily, easy to wipe down, my 9 month old will sit in it for over 30 minutes, so it must be fairly comfortable.  CONS:  ***the table does not always latch properly and can be pushed off by an excited 9 month old***, hitting her and sending food flying.  It will seem to attach securely at the beginning of the meal, but then becomes loose and has to be re-attached.  The harness/seat belt buckle also gets stuck and is very difficult to undo and the baby gets squirmier the longer it takes to undo the belt.  I would definitely not buy this chair again and I would not recommend it to others.",2
Electronic Digital Caliper 6&quot; with Extra large LCD Display Screen with Carrying Case,"I replaced a lost caliper with this one and it's great for general shop use.  I don't know if it's accurate enough for machining or reloading, but it's perfect for my needs.",5
"Munchkin Dora the Explorer Grip N Sip Juice Box Carrier, Colors May Vary","My granddaughter loves Dora.  This product is perfect for juice boxes or pouches.  Since there seems to be many different sizes of juice boxes, the brand you pick may fit loosely or snugly.  My grand daughter is 22 months, so she doesn't try to pull the boxes out, so the loose ones are fine.  The handles work great, as she can lift and carry around.  Bought two of them - one for Grandpa's house and one for home.  The bottom  and handles are a soft rubbery material, so its easy to grip without slipping, and it provides a non-slip bottom so it doesn't slide easily either.  I am very impressed with the product.  I know I will need to look for other ones besides Dora as my first grandson is coming soon.  Great job Munchkin.",5
"Fresh Baby 2 Pack Collapsible Water Bottle,  Motherhood Motif,  16 Ounce",Got this for a plane trip. It doesn't hold much over 8 oz. The cap to one of the bottles actually arrived bused an unusable. Not a good deal for what you pay for this product.,2
Mute Button Pacifier (Baby Blue),"I thought this was supposed to be a mute button for my cousin's infant but instead it's just a pacifier.  It is a very high quality, BPA-free pacifier, but I found if you really need to silence the baby it just takes a couple good shakes (kidding!)",5
T-228 Plug-in Compact Charger with 4 pcs of Tenergy 9V 250mAh NiMH Batteries,i have had it for a few months no problems so far i would have gone through 6 batteries without it works great in my metal detector that only uses alkaline batteries,5
"Regalo My Cot Portable Bed, Royal Blue","We got this for my 3 year old son to use when sleeping over at our families houses. He had no place to sleep except the floor so I wanted to get something he could use for a while and be comfortable in. First off, I was very relieved to find that there was no bar in the middle of the cot. The bars are underneath the cot and no where does the cot lay on top of any bars. It is low to ground which is nice, if the kid happens to roll off its not a far drop. The size is great. I wish the cot was a little more comfortable with some padding or something but it's a standard cot. My son used it for the first time to stay at a family members house when we weren't there and we were told that he slept on it throughout the night and even walked back in later the next day and laid down to take a nap. Its also great that its compact, light and portable.",4
Medela SoftShells for Inverted Nipples,"I bought this item on my own because I read the wonderful reviews it received. I really don't know HOW this item can be used. Even if you don't use the air-vented cups (which collect the leaking milk), you can plainly see the soft shells in loose clothing. I was wearing a sweater & you could see the shape of the shells right through it. If you do use the cups they supply, you look absolutely abnormal. I guess this doesn't work for large-breasted women!",1
"Lamaze Crib Soother, Northern Lights","This is a very colorful, entertaining soother.  It can accomodate a MP3 player and besides musical selections, the soother plays pond sounds!  The only problem is that when you start it up, it goes thru a little musical interlude until reaching the song and then to get to the pond sound, you continue to punch buttons.  The other nice aspect is that it is soft, not hard plastic.  Baby can turn it on using the little button on the left hand side.  Something different for the crib!",4
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,"Assembly was a bit rough with the first gate I installed but the second one went much quicker after learning what not to do with the first one. I do recommend using the wall caps for at least the top 2 even if your not using it for stairs. It gives the gate more stability, which is what we need with our dogs. One keeps thinking he can jump it (has yet to make it) and the other keeps trying to lean on it and paw it like he did to get past the wooden ones.Overall it is a solid gate and not that expensive. Happy with my purchase !",5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I'm not a mom. I'm not even a woman, but this thing is awesome. I'm a natural side sleeper and experience that weird pain if my knees touch. To keep that from happening, I sleep with a pillow between my knees. I also hug a pillow and use two for my head. This pillow has changed all of that. It's a weird looking thing, but it's versatile and even makes sleeping on my back comfortable. Big spoon. Little Spoon. Use it to prop up your shoulders, neck, and head. This thing does it all.",5
"Orbit Baby Stroller Panniers, Mocha","I loooove my panniers along with my Orbit G2 stroller. I have used these and the underneath storage while shopping at.. Costco!!! Yes, I have used it multiple times without having to use a cart.  Ive had Costco employees be amazed at how much stuff I can fit in, I even bought a large pack of paper towels and placed them on top of the car seat, where the feet are (because my son is a few month old and doesnt reach the end yet).  Each pannier fits two gallons of milk, those plastic milk jugs.  I just tell you that for reference, so its easy to understand how roomy they are.  They fold when not in use, so that they are still attached but your stroller is not as wide.  I couldnt live without them.",5

"Babiators Unisex-Baby Infant Ops Junior Sunglasses, Black, Small","I totally recommend this sunglasses,  I received a pair of sun glasses for my little one when he was only 6 months old, when i saw them i thought well this will be great for a picture, I did not think that he was going to like them, but to my surprise he loved them now he is almost 9 months and he loves them and he llok great with them",5
The First Years Ignite Stroller,"This was a really good stroller.  I found a deal at Target one day for a different stroller for $10 on clearance boy was that a mistake, and I have not heard the end of it from my wife.This did a fantastic job on our vacation to the Ozarks.  The straps are adjustable so it can accommodate about any size kid.  I saw some people had problems with the access of the storage compartment on the bottom of it.  I didn't think it was that bad and we were able to fit plastic shopping bags in there no problem and if they didn't fit there you could sling them over the handle.  There was a storage compartment next to the handles which accommodate something to drink and a storage pouch for phone/snacks/wallet.One draw back to it is it is rather long when it is folded up.  If you have a compact car you might have problems storing this and other stuff in the trunk as you might have to store it diagonal in trunk.  In our mid size SUV it would fit widthwise in the back.Overall this is a pretty good stroller for the price and has held up very well.",4
"North States Superyard Play Yard, Grey, 6 Panel","We were looking for a gate that we could use to keep our little one away from the fireplace.  This gate works well.  Great for putting out on the deck and for putting little man down to  play for awhile.  Only downside is that our son is 1 and a big boy. He can slide the gate around on carpeting. He is still secure in gate but we often find him, the gate and his toys on the opposite side of the room from where we left him.  The gate comes with foam feet to help it keep from sliding on wood floors. We haven't tried them yet but they may help prevent sliding on carpeting as well.  Not a huge issue for us as he is still secure in side",5
Bummis Reusable Fleece Liners,I love these reusable liners they never stain (for me) and keep the yuck from your cloth diapers. :-) and they are super inexpensive,5
Skip Hop Sort and Spin Fishbowl Sorter Bath Toy,"this is an awesome bath toy!it's simple but fun. the fishbowl's suction cup is STRONG and holds really well on the tiled wall or the tub itself. the toys that fill it up float and squirt. the bowl itself, once held by the suction cup, can spin and dump all the toys out then spin to be right side up again. then all the toys can be stored in the bowl and the water drains out completely when the bath is over.my three year old has so much fun with this toy - it's completely open ended and promotes imaginative play since there's no ""one way"" to play with it.my six month old loves watching the toys bob up and down in the water and i know will love this set more and more as she grows up, too.i've found that simple is best with bath toys. they stay cleanest and ultimately are the ones that are played with most. this one is my favorite because it's totally self contained so it leaves the sides and corners of the tub free from wet toys!love it.",5
Medela Breastmilk Bottle Spare Parts,"Excellent product you always needs spare parts. From time to time, by 10 month old boy, drops or throw one of his breast-milk bottles and has broken two rings already. They still work but they could leak so it's better to put them apart.",5
"Britax Boulevard Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I think that Britax delivers just what is promises with this seat-- a seat that is both easy to use and provides as much security as it can for your precious cargo. When my (big) 4-month-old daughter started seeming like she was ready to bust out of the britax companion (infant carrier seat) I knew that it was time for us to move her up to a convertible seat. After having been so satisfied with the britax companion and hearing that britax convertibles were the safest out there, we decided that we were going to shell out the money.  It was a tough decision to choose between the marathon, boulevard, and decathlon.  Ultimately, it came down to the increased protection of the side-impact ""wings"" that made us go with the boulevard. Plus, our daughter had always been a good sleeper in the infant carrier and because of the side-impact headrest, we never found her slumped over to the side.We are thrilled with the seat! As she got to be a little too big for the infant carrier, she had gotten in the habit of crying while in the car if she was awake. Now, she travels happily awake and asleep! She definitely makes good use of the ""wings"" as a headrest during her naps, but she'll also just sit back there and jabber away during her rides if she's not sleepy. I love how easy it is to clip her in.  The seat is incredibly easy to adjust and get to fit her just right. And I can't omit the fact that she looks really adorable back there in her ""big girl seat"" in this cute print-- the online pictures don't do it justice.I have to say that people shouldn't buy this seat because they think it will be a breeze to install.  Good carseat installations take time and attention!!! Although it is ""easy"" to get a good installation, I still work up a sweat making sure that this seat is as secure as possible. I would hate to think that someone might shell out this much money and then do a half-hearted job of installing it securely so that the seat can't function as well as it should in the event of a collision. A seat is only as good as the installation and I encourage people to do a thorough job of installing it, or-- better yet-- get a certified carseat tech to do it for you! (Your local firestation should have details.)PROS: safety, easy to get my child in and adjust the straps to fit, durable and attractive fabricCONS: expensive (although I have to say worth every penny if it protects my baby!) installation takes time and effort (but again, this is how it should be)",4

Snap 'N Go Infant Car Seat Carrier,"As the other reviewers have noted, the new Graco Snugride and the new Snap N Go ARE NOT compatible.  My husband called the company and they confirmed that the Graco does NOT snap onto the stroller.  We will also be taking back the Snap N Go and either trying the Kolcraft model or buying the Graco stroller to go with the carseat.Baby Trends should not be allowed to say that the Snap N Go works with the Graco when it clearly does not.  What a joke!",1

Animals Alphabet Baby Nursery Peel &amp; Stick Wall Art Sticker Decals for Boys and Girls,"I was unsure about ordering these because of he reviews.  I'm glad I decided to see for myself.  They are great!  The patterns, colors, and designs are beautiful. The package did come rolled up, which could have caused the edges to lift, but I stuck the package under my matress for a few days and problem solved.  They stuck very well to the wall surface and I peeled one off numerous times to test the adhesion.  Again, zero problems.  Definitely recommend.",5

"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large","My daughter received this for her 4th birthday and it has become her constant companion.  It's extremely well made with a heavy wooden base, does not tip easily, goes fast and can spin in circles ... all around a really great and entertaining toy.  I love how compact and rounded it is as we don't have much space, it lets her have a ball indoors while it's too hot to play outside and she's just figured out she can steer by leaning her body weight and make the mouse spin.  I did see comments about these being 'small', my daughter is tall and lanky and has no problem zipping around on her mouse :)  I've oddly also seen comments about the wheely bugs being too big or hard to use - these are definitely only for children that can put their feet flat on the ground and push themselves with confidence because these babies MOVE, they're on free moving casters and roll way quicker than most other plastic push/ride on type toys.  I have a newly walking baby in the house that likes to push the mouse around sideways but it gets away from him pretty easily, this is not a push toy for babies for sure!",5
Starting Small Frog Novelty Hamper - Green,Just received this item to complete a nursery with a frog theme.  This is an excellent lightweight and cute hamper.  I would definitely recommend this item to others.  It is much nicer then items that are twice as expensive in stores,5
Fresh Baby So Easy Baby Food and Breast Milk Trays,"These trays have really impressed me.  I have been using them consistently for the past month and have been pleased with them everytime.  The lids seal nicely, and I only need to slightly twist the tray before dispensing the cubes into my freezer bag. I froze a blueberry puree in the trays last night and was concerned I would find the trays discolored the next day.  But nope, the trays cleaned beautifully.  I'm completely satisfied with this product and will likely purchase another set in the future.",5

"Delta Portable Mini Crib, Cherry","I purchased this as an extra crib for my parent's house.  I only get back to see them once or twice a year but needed something for our son to sleep in for during our two week visit.  The crib served its purpose and can be easily folded up and stored under the bed in the guest room.  The mattress it came with was very thin, so I purchased a portable mattress separately.  My son was 5 months old when we used it, and it was a bit small.  He definitely did not have room to spin around like he does in his standard crib.  I recommend this as a second/extra crib.",4

"Kidz Delight Smooth Touch Smart Phone, Black Display","I bought this phone for my one year old for Christmas expecting it to be similar to an actual smartphone since that's how it's advertised and priced, bc he loved our cell phones so much. He's almost 2 years old now and still prefers his $5 play phone over this one. I changed the batteries to be sure they weren't duds....they weren't the product shouldn't be advertised for making noise or lighting up. You can't hear anything, there are no buttons just stickers and I was so disappointed mainly because childrens phones are typically much cheaper than this one, I was willing to pay extra because I thought it would be heavier and more high tech simulating an actual cell phone....I was wrong :-(",1

I think it was worth. its a reaaaly CUTE bed",3
"Kaboost Portable Chair Booster, Green","This really was the perfect fix for my daughter. She would constantly balance on the edge of her booster seat and occasionally fell. Plus, at 5 years old, she was starting to whine about needing a booster seat. This raises the chair but makes her feel like a big girl! The only reason it does not have 5 stars is because my daughter has tried to move or scoot the chair around and occasionally the kaboost has snapped off the bottom. It's just the way she is lifting it, and no one has gotten hurt. Also, it has rubber pads on the bottom that are so non-skid it is difficult to move the chair on a vinyl floor without lifting it. Otherwise, great product, I plan on buying a second one soon!",4
Regalo Hide Away Double Sided Bed Rail - White,"I purchased these rails when my 19 month old daughter moved from her crib to a ""big girl"" twin sized bed. Although the instructions weren't SUPER easy to understand, assembly was completely doable and took me about 30 minutes from start to finish. The rails are very sturdy, fit very tightly to the mattress and have not torn/bent/etc like you see with many bedrails. I like to research and read reviews for every product I purchase from Amazon.com, and I'm  sure that many of you are the same way. I 100% recommend these rails!",5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll","It's OK.  I like it, but don't love it.  My daughter loses interest in it rather quickly.  I'm always trying to change up her play routine, so it's a good interactive toy for that.  I don't use it on a car seat or stroller, just her chair she sits semi upright in.  It's easy to adjust and move into position so that's a plus.  The quality is not as it is pictured.",4
Playtex Diaper Genie Twist- Away Pail System,"Overall, I think the Diaper Genie is a good product.  It's pretty easy to use and refill.  I don't think it will be good at keeping the odors concealed once my daughter starts solids.  Right now it doesn't contain the smell of breastfed waste.  Her nursery smells like butter when I walk in.  And I change the Genie at least twice a week.My biggest complaint is not so much the smell, but that you have to push the diaper through to a level before it actually seals the dirty diaper.  Pushing a full diaper home is not my idea of fun.I was in IKEA one day, in the changing room and the diaper pail in there was a pleasure to use.  You just put the diaper in a hole and the top rotates and viola!!  It's gone!  No need to touch anything.",4

"Safety 1st OnSide Air Protect Convertible Car Seat, Adeline Black","I am very happy with this carseat. It is a good quality car seat.Pros:Light weight- I have to take my daughter to the babysitter and leave her car seat. It is lightweight and easy to move.It fits well in small cars- my husband has a ford fiesta and this seat fits easily and he does not have to move his seat far forwardThere is good amount of padding in the head areaThe price is great- if you are looking for a good looking, comfortable, lower price car seat then this is a great choiceCons:It does not recline like some of the other convertible car seats when rear facing.The latch system is not very easy if you are taking it in and out of a car a lot, it has the hook latch not the easy press one like my infant seat had. I use the seatbelt option, that is easier for us.Overall I would recommend this carseat to a friend.",4

"The First Years Secure Adjust Toilet Trainer, Colors May Vary","This seat does adjust well to fit different sized toilets.  The two piece design, however, leaves much to be desired.  If my daughter doesn't sit on the seat just right, pee gets in between the two pieces, then drips out when she takes the seat off the toilet.  It is easy enough to take the pieces apart for cleaning, but there are lots of little crevices that are hard to get to.  The seat is also a bit uncomfortable for her - we will be looking for another alternative.",2
Vulli So'Pure Ball Toy,"My 16 mo loves these balls. I love that they're safe for him to put in his mouth (he is still at the stage where he puts everything in his mouth). They're perfect for his tiny hands.Yes - they tend to flatten when you squeeze them... that doesn't seem to bother my son one bit, though.And they don't squeak - personally I am thankful for that.. we already have enough noisy toys in the house.We've also invested in a bigger ball by Crocodile Creek - and my son seems to enjoy playing with both these balls equally - obviously he can throw the Sophie balls much more easily.I just wish they were slightly cheaper or that we had the option to buy just 1 or 2 balls. We don't really play with all 3 balls at the same time.",5

Munchkin Mighty Grip 10 oz Spill Proof Straw Cup,"This is a great straw cup, easy to clean and doesn't leak.  The only way it does leak is if there is some liquid at the tip of the straw and it gets knocked over or something.  I have some of the other munchkin straw cups that close but they are more of a pain to clean, I LOVE THESE.  I gave this cup to my 18 month old who was just learning how to use a straw and she fell in love with it. I also like it b/c she drinks plenty of water out of this cup.",5
"Joovy Room Playard with Bassinet and Changing Table, Blueberry","I just purchased this for my two year old as a bed in our vacation home, and wished I would have purchased it for home as well! Although she is two and tall, she has plenty of room in length and width to roll over and toss in her sleep. The rails are taller than my pack 'n play, and I do not worry about her being able to climb out. She still in within the weight range to use the changing table as well, however I just set it (changing table/pad) on the bed or the floor for my convenience since I would have to remove it when she was in there sleeping. She loves the mp3 hookup- I was able to use my phone's &#34;sound machine app&#34; and play her white noise through it during her nap. (Was on vacation, did not have an mp3 player, wouldn't normally leave my phone in her room)Easy to assemble, very nice looking and would be perfect for a newborn co-sleeping bed (in your bedroom) or great to travel with, as it has a carrying case with a nice strap. Could check it as baggage easily and I would not worry about its frame being comprimised during airport handling.Only downside is you have to buy Joovy sheets only for it I beleive, which are rather pricey. The graco kind do not fit. But the sheet is by far the nicest crib sheet I have felt!",5

"Baby Einstein Musical Motion Activity Jumper, Blue","Overall great product, lots of interesting things to do.  Music/keyboard is nice, and music is less annoying than other baby items we have had.  Only caveat is that we have a pretty small 6 month old, and as others have mentioned, we need to put a book underneath even on the lowest setting for her toes to touch.",4
Sassy Xylophone Musical Toy,"We got this as a Christmas present for our 6 month old daughter.  It didn't work from the start.  I would try replacing the batteries, but this product is purposely designed to make that difficult.  In tiny print on the back of the packaging, it says ""This product contains non-replaceable batteries.""  Why? I would bet that the batteries would be easy to replace if I could open this toy up, but it's put together with non-standard screws with triangular-slotted heads.  One star for this annoying design.",1
Fisher-Price The Perfect Potty Ring,"Perfect for my 16 month old who I'm beginning to sit him on the potty to get familiar with it.  I like the color, it matches my bathroom and how it has a clip to hang it from the toilet tank when not in use so it's just not laying around.  It fits our long toilet seat fine. We have a child's step stool that we place by the toilet as well.  The splash gaurd is great to stop accidents.  Much better buy than these whole potties and way less messy.  Who wants to deal with that? Yuck! Bettet to just train them right on the big potty.",5
"Chicco DJ Baby Walker, Splash","My son has been walking for about a month and we needed something to keep him occupied while strengthening his legs for walking.  It's pretty easy to assemble.  Wish it had ""bumpers"" on it so when it hit the wall, furniture, etc, it won't make a mark or such a big noise.  Bought table foam guards and applied myself and that seems to work.  Adjusts well for tall babies and lots of noises and lights for him to play with.",4
Philips Avent 3 Pack 9oz Bottles,This bottle was a life saver.  I didn't think anything about the leaking because babies are washable.  I was able to put her ceral in the bottle before bed time and the hole house got a good nights sleep.  My daughter has less gas and is happy when I put fruit and other things in this bottle.  It's just a wonderful bottle.,4
Mobi Pure Sounds Digital Audio Monitor,Had this monitor for about 2 months. Works great and is sound activated. Very sensitive to the baby's sound so I can hear it even if she breathes hard. Of course I have it on loud but you can turn it down a little and hear mainly the louder noises.,5

"Joovy Nook Highchair, Greenie Fabric","We love this high chair! We live in a small townhouse, so getting a high chair that was sturdy and compact was our goal. We have a TINY dining area and were disappointed with the collapsable high chairs we looked at. They were either cheap or ugly or didn't really fold flat. We had pretty much settled for another chair when a co-worker told me about the Joovy Nook, and we are so glad she did!We got the green chair, which unlike the Amazon pictures, actually is a pleasant lime green instead of yellowish. Setting it up initially was very easy, and directions were clear. The straps are simple to adjust, and we could tell right away that this was a high chair that folds up flat, was very study, and made of high quality materials. The removable tray cover is a nice option for people who would like to remove the surface to soak or put in a drying rack. Our daughter always seems comfortable in it, and there is plenty of padding on the back and bottom of the seat.The best thing about this chair is how easy it is to fold flat and open to a useable position. This is the only piece of baby gear that I have ever used that you can truly collapse or open with one hand. I can collapse it flat or open it easily with my very chunky baby in one hand.We highly recommend this high chair!",5

Kiddopotamus Bibbity Rinse and Roll Bib In Green,"This is one item every Mom needs!  Once your baby is eating baby food and finger foods, this is a MUST.  Right up until they are old enough to be able to do without a bib.  It is adjustable in the back, easy to clean, easy to take along, and best of all, it is a great ""catcher"" for food tasted and rejected, if you know what I mean.  Super product!",5

Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,"I used this set with the Medela Pump in style for my daughter (now 20 months) and am about to purchase it again for number two. I went back to work when my daughter was 5 months, but breastfed her till she was 11 months, so had lots of experience with the set, which was small convenient, easy to use and interchangeable with other niples and bottles for when she got older.  My only complaint is that I culdn't buy a steam steriliser to accompany the set (as you can with Avent systems) as boiling the bottles every day was a real chore.",4
Safety 1st Crystal Clear Nursery Monitor,"I spent so much time trying to place this monitor in a location where it doesn't play static. The amount of static varies based on whether it's plugged in (more static) or using battery power, where it's placed on the table, and whether or not you're touching it. It's so aggravating that I find myself relocating so I can hear my son myself rather than listen to the annoying static. I'm currently on the market for a new one.",1

Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Step Up,I love that this seat fits over the toilet so I don't have to clean a training potty; however it needs some sort of function that will secure it to the adult potty. Maybe just some clips that would hook to the installed seat or something. My daughter wouldn't sit on the potty until we got this seat. Now she likes climbing up there on her own! I am hoping this makes potty training a little easier on us all!,3

"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I just want to say how much I love my moby wrap. When I first got it I thought it might be complicated to figure out, but once we looked at the video of how to do it and did a few times it was a piece of cake. Now we use it several times a day for our 4 week old daughter. It really calms her down. It is so much better than some of the other baby carriers that do not promote the closeness that this one does.",5

"Skip Hop 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set, Treetop Friends","I have been debating buying this bedding for my little girl. I really liked skip hop activity mat with treetop friends and we came across it at a store and my husband being the harshest critic Loved it. I tried to check out the bedding for treetop friends and could not really find it anywhere. From the pictures the skirt looked dark brown and i didnt like that. Also bumper pads looked flimsy and cheaply made from the pictures. bumper pads are beautifull and just enough thickness. I love the quality. very cute. in the picture you dont see on upper part of the comforter , there is a little cute bird picture too. skirt color is not dark brown. it is more like muted down brown , more light mocha. Sheet is a good quality. SOOO neutral yet cute enough for a girl:) I have also found matching wall decal. It wouldnt been flawless if skip hop made mobile to match with it because all the owls and squirrels will be just soo cute:) Also wanted to add I washed all the bedding in delicate setting and came out great.so here is the wall art. it is from etsy.com ---  [...]copy and paste will work . i hope:)",5

BABYBJORN Potty Chair - Red,"This has turned out to be a great little potty for our little boy.  He is tall for his age but still fits on here easily. Thankfully we have very few messes to clean up as the front shield does a great job of preventing any target practice around the bathroom.  It is also easy to clean, if still disgusting.  But really what potty chair isn't?  At this point I can't think of anything I would change about this potty chair.  Our son really likes the color and the fact that he can dump it out into the &#34;big potty&#34; and flush.",5

These are the best designed stroller hooks on the market without a doubt.",5
Earlyears Roll n Swirl Ball Ramp,"Unfortunately I bought this toy thinking my son would be interested in playing with this neat new toy which I had found amusing, but sadly he was not.

Kiddyloo Toilet Seat Reducer (Blue/Green) - Toddler Potty Training Seat,"Before purchase(in 2007)I spent many weeks researching--asking friends and professionals for recommendations, what was important for them, what things I should consider when deciding, and things to avoid. On top of that I read as many reviews and discussion as I could on the web. I had too many friends who had to purchase 2, 3, or 4 potties before finding one that worked and I quite frankly did not have money for that. So I decided to go with a toilet seat reducer.I purchased the Kiddyloo as it looked to be sturdy, easy to clean, easy to use, easy to store and attractive to small children. It was indeed! Our nearly 2-year-old daughter liked the look of it, and right away noticed the frog face embossed on the step which is lightly textured to help with traction. She was excited to try it right away. It took about a week before we successfully had a splash-down, but within a few weeks of the first, she was fully potty trained and excited about it. The seat appears to be very comfortable and has suited her size from 20 months to 3 years of age. She has never complained of lost circulation, pinches or other discomfort even when she has sat upon it for 10 minutes to read a book. Her bottom has gotten a pink ring after that time, but she said it did not hurt. The step is stable and roomy enough to stand and turn on without problem. It took some time for her to master the turn herself, but there is sufficient area allowed for the hand grip and it is well designed.The worst and only injury she has gotten from this potty is a pinched finger when she was trying to move the potty herself (not recommended by manufacturer) and the potty folded down upon the legs (and thus her finger) as it is designed to do. As it is all very light weight there was no real injury or harm done. Just some temporary pain from a pinch.The only draw backs we experienced are in assembly, which was very straight forward. It is designed to be assembled with a Euro coin (at least the European version is). I found coin assembly to be a bit cumbersome. Even so, I mastered it by the third screw. They are giant plastic screws with a coin-sized slot on the head. I adjusted the height of the step once, and it was easy enough to unscrew and re-screw. And a coin allowed for sufficient torque to tighten securely without damaging parts.The last huge plus is that this unit is easy to clean and sanitize with a cloth and cleaning solution as it has large, smooth surfaces.UPDATE: We used this aid for about a year before we lent it to a friend's child who also experienced immediate success with it, quenching the child's fear of the grown-up toilet. In the time we used it, the unit never tipped or caused an accident other than that pinched finger. We were extremely satisfied with this product and recommend it highly.",5
Cotton Tale Designs Big Equipment Decorator Lamp,"I bought this lamp for my newborn son's room.  It is very cute!  I thought the truck was made of a soft material, but it is hard plastic.  The price was a little rediculous, but I watched and waited for the price to go down.  When I first looked, it was around $50, but I got it for $30.  So, beware of the frequent price changes on here!",4
"Kushies Waterproof Change Pad, Cream Polka Dots","Neither the product description nor the packaging tells you that this pad has a vinyl backing -- you have to read the fine print on the back of the label to find that out. I'm trying to avoid vinyl for my baby, so this is getting returned!",1

"Graco Swing By Me Portable 2-in-1 Swing, Little Hoot","This swing is very cute. That's about the only thing it has going for it.  It's noisy, the harness padding slips off super easily, my baby is under the weight limit but don't fit comfortably in the harness, also the swing never did swing correctly. It would stop all the time and I had to push it together it going. (And yes I replaced the batteries) Lastly, my 5 month old weight 18 lbs and is 28.5inches long and the swing won't swing anymore.  Do yourself a favor and buy a different one.",1
"Bumkins Flushable Diaper Liner, Neutral, 100 Pack",Very easy to use and effective too. I would recommend it to my friends and I will be buying more soon...,5
Floppy Seat,"I hate to think of all the germs in shopping carts.  I always used this seat cover and never let my son touch the shopping carts or restaurant high chairs.  Too bad at 26 months he is now too big for it and now sits in those germ infested car shopping carts.  Oh well.  Purchase this product and you won't be disappointed.  I washed it often and it lived in the trunk of my car.  I do have to say that I did not put it in the carry bag form because it took too long to get it that way, but it didn't matter anyway it was quicker to put it in the grocery cart when it was not in the bag form.  A great baby shower gift!",5
Vulli Chan Pie Gnon Natural Rubber Teether - Blue Chan,I think my dog likes it more than my daughter.  It has a squeaker that's a bit obnoxious.  Our daughter is 6 months and putting everything in her mouth.  I thought she'd love it but it's a no go as of now.  We'll try again later I guess.  I just have to hide it from the dog!UPDATE!  We tried it again and she loves it at 7 months.  We'll put a bunch of toys in front of her and she will go for this one - she loves the squeaker and gnaws on it like crazy....  But we still have to hide it from the dog :),3
"Munchkin Click LockDeluxe Snack Catcher, Blue/Green, 2-Count",I love this snack catcher however my son did not! They are perfect size for my toddler but he didn't like sticking his hand into the flexible opening. I also loved that it has a resealable cap (that folds under the catcher) to keep the snack fresh!  Just wish he would use them! Maybe I keep them and try again when he is a little older.,3
"SwaddleDesigns Ultimate Receiving Blanket, Dots and Hearts, Fuchsia","As a first time mom I received a ton of blankets, in those I was given one of these, best blanket ever! It makes swaddling so easy, and for those nights where you want the baby warm this thicker fabric is awesome! We used it so much we had to buy 2 more otherwise we would have been doing laundry all the time.  Highly recommend, worth the price.",5
"Bummis Fabulous Wet Diaper Bag, Green, Small","We've used this bag for 6 and a half months, washing it with the rest of the diaper laundry and hanging to dry.  It's done a very good job containing wetness, and a so-so job containing odors.  It's thin and easy to find space for it in the diaper bag.  However, the handle came unstitched in the wash last week (I see others have had this problem), and now the interior of the bag is de-laminating.I investigated today and found that Bummis' warranty extends for 6 months after the purchase date.  I'm sad that this wet bag is so utterly destroyed, but maybe I didn't have realistic expectations for the lifetime of a wet bag?  (Six months seems to be Bummis' expectation?)  We have a wet bag by Planet Wise that we use just as often-- but we've had it longer--and it's holding up well.I could recommend this bag for occasional use, but be prepared to buy another one several months down the line!",3
"The First Years 2 Pack 9 Ounce Insulated Sippy Cup, Disney Princess","We've tried many different cup makers and styles to find the right one in each stage of our twins' development. These, because they specifically say spill-proof and change colors, are pretty cool cups. Problem is the packaging does NOT say leak proof. Of the four we purchased, three leak like a sieve. It wouldn't be nice to tell person who designed them what I'd like to do with the leaky cups but you can sure guess what I'd like to do. If you are even slightly considering these, DON'T! Instead, run to the nearest store, buy a 1/2 pint of cold milk, and pour it into your child's car seat while they are sitting in it. That way you get the same effect but without the expense of the cups.",1

"Prince Lionheart Seat Neat, Black/Grey","This has protected our leather covered kitchen chairs VERY well. It is definitely one of those purchases I have never regretted and felt it was worth every penny of the thirteen dollars I spent on it. Without it, the chair under my son's booster seat would not only be constantly filthy, it would also probably be damaged from the booster seat. I would definitely recommend this product.",5
"Babiators Unisex-Baby Infant Ops Junior Sunglasses, Black, Small","I have looked for glasses that would protect my grandson's eyes from the harmful UV rays and these do just that.  They look nice, are durable and fit well.  I cannot believe how cute he is with these on.",5

"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Diaper Pail, White","Very nice.  Had heard bad things about diaper genies, mainly that they aren't robust.  This one is.  Easy to use, easy to refill bags, and really contains the small.  Once the bag is really full, may not smell like roses, but is to be expected.  Even with a well-destroyed diaper, still easy to get into the container while holding the baby.",4
"Stork Craft Beatrice 5 Drawer Chest, White","I read other reviews that said it was headache, but I went ahead and purchased this item because it's less expense than anything I else I saw. I should have listened... I ordered it in Feb, it is now May and we still don't have the dresser together. There were pieces missing, and a major piece broken. When you try to call, the line is busy. I had to hang up and redial, what felt like forever. They said my piece would come in 3 weeks, it was more like 7 weeks. The piece that was broken had the drawer rails on it, but when it came, it had no rails. So, I said I wanted to return the entire thing, they were fine with it, but it can take up to 8 weeks to get your money back.  So, at this point in time, we are going to go to the hardware store to buy what we need so that I can have a dresser in my son's room.",1
Baby Care Play Mat - Pingko Friends (Large),"I am a teacher in an infant room at a very popular preschool and bought this mat for my class! I LOVE it! The farm scene is AWESOME (guinea pigs included!) and I love the alphabet animals.  It is a great size;  my assistant and I and four or so infants fit comfortably during playtime! When I got it out of the box, the smell mentioned was only noticeable if I put my face very close to the mat and it dissipated after a day or two. Plus, there was a 10% off code when I bought this. PURCHASE THIS MAT if you are a mother currently or going to be. It is great!",5
Preggie Pop Drops (21 Pieces) - Assortment of Sour Flavors ( Multi-Pack),"These seem to work well to help subside nausea and queasiness. However, it's basically just candy so if I eat more than just a couple I feel kind of gross just from all the sugar (3 candies is 12grams)... I don't usually eat much sugar and candy, so for me, it's a little much.Side note: seemed like these took FOREVER to get to me in the mail, and there was no tracking available. Took a week and a half for me to get these, and when you are nauseous, that is a long time to wait.",4
Gorilla Playsets Infant Swing,"This swing was a huge disappointment.  It came in a box with no instructions.  The swing has two different rings on the hanging ends that we were never able to figure out what to do with them and how it was supposed to be hung.  We ended up buying hardware to hang it through the rope loops bypassing the confusing rings.  Once we finally had the swing up we realized that no matter what we did it leaned forward.  After paying $20 for the swing, $20 for shipping and $11 on hanging hardware we are junking the swing adn looking for a new one that is better made.  Dont waste your money on this trash.",1

"Bummis Swimmi Cloth Diapers, Turtles, Small (9-15 lbs)","I had bought a size medium Bummi Swim Diaper last summer and wound up never using it. This year, since my son is a year older, I purchased a new swim diaper.  After reading reviews, I went with an iPlay swim diaper, size X-large (my son is 19 months and 28 lbs which, according to the sizing and all the reviewers, it should have fit.)  I stupidly didn't have him try it on and this morning, on the day of his first swim lesson, found that it was too small and I couldn't snap it around his waist.  I remembered that I had the old Bummi laying around and prayed it might be usable - it was a tad small, but because of the velcro, I was able to make it work and fit around his waist.  The diaper worked GREAT, the velcro held well and I'm nor ordering a couple more Bummi's in the appropriate size.",5

Circo&reg; Baby Knit Stripe Hooded Towel - Green,I am not very impressed with this hooded towel.  The fabric is very thin (not very absorbant) and kind of scratchy.  I know the price is really good but compared to some of the other hooded towels out there i'd rather spend a little more for better quality.,2
"Storksak Olivia Diaper Bag, Moss","I love love love this bag. I have used it now for over six months. I love the interior pockets and I especially love all the outside pockets- there are 4 pouches on the outside, plus the zipper pocket that I use for  my wallet (which is the small black bag that comes with it.) I love how you have a cross body strap, so you can be hands free and also have the option to put over your shoulder. I bought the storksak stroller clips and I love using those with my stroller. It is easy to clean and I can cram so much in this bag- seriously it is always filled to the brim. I love the look of the bag- I have gotten a lot of compliments on it! BUY THIS! You won't be sorry!",5

"Graco DuoGlider Classic Connect Stroller, Dragonfly","The seller made no mistakes about this.  It shipped fast and high quality.  The only problem was the information from the manufacturer that said it had a 5-Point harness for each child, which we wanted since our 18 month old likes to climb out.  But, again, not the seller's fault.  Easy to turn and maneuver.  Convenient features.  All around nice stroller.",3
"HALO SleepSack Micro-Fleece Wearable Blanket, Blue Dog, X-Large",This blanket is great. I have used these on my daughter since she was 4 months old and I love them.

I will not be purchasing anything from this manufacturer again.",1
Loveybums Wool Pull-up Diaper Cover - Pink - medium (9-22 lbs.),"This is a very adorable, yet functional cover. I got a size Medium which fit my newborn perfectly. She was a hefty 10 pound, 4 ounce newborn but lost a tiny bit of weight as newborns do, and it fit perfectly. It aired her bottom out nicely during the day. I never used it at night as it's just too light of a cover for that, but PERFECT for day time use. Got a bit of newborn poop on it, and it stained, but the actual poop washed out easy peasy. A fitted worked great under it. The pink cover is lovely!",4
"Woombie Winter Fleece Baby Swaddler (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Eggnog)","This Woombie swaddler is easy to use and keeps the baby warm and snuggly while allowing the arms to move around.  We had tried velcro swaddlers in the past, which were nice, but the velcro tended to wear out, and our baby could sometimes wiggle out of them.  Our house temperature is cooler than most in the winter (between 63-68F), so the fleece of the winter Woombie keeps our baby warm.  On colder nights (when the house is below 65F), we wrap another blanket around the Woombie.  I would have given this five stars, except that I thought the sizing was a little off.  I purchased this for my newborn when she was three weeks old (8.5 pounds, 21.5 inches), and it was almost too small.  Her feet couldn't stretch out all the way.  It says it's sized for 5-13 pounds, but I think the upper limit is not possible.  We returned it and purchased the next size up, which has worked great!  I might buy a summer weight Woombie, if my baby still needs to be swaddled when it's warmer.The Woombie is a little more expensive than other swaddlers I have used, but it's worth the price.  The fleece fabric is thicker than most, the zipper is heavy duty, and it is easy to wash and dry.  I'm sorry that I didn't know about the Woombie when my older child was a baby.  Great product.",4
MobiCam Audio Video Baby Monitoring System,"I HATE this thing and wish I would have gotten a different one.  for one thing it SUCKS battery's so fast!  would have been nice to have a chargeable handset.  takes 6 AA batteries and if you've got the screen on it'll last like a night.  when my daughter was about 4 months old it started buzzing.  there's this LOVELY buzzing/staticy type noise that makes it almost imposible to hear the baby without turning way up and then annoying yourself with the stupid buzzing.  Now the screen also gets staticy and fuzzy at random times and last night the screen just went blank and no sound randomly.  I'm soo frustrated with this thing!!!  Don't waste your money, other's might be more expensive but they're probably a heck of alot better quality than this piece of junk",1

"Lambs &amp; Ivy Changing Pad Cover, Little Hoot","We bought this for our second child. With our first, we quickly realized soft fuzzy covers made changing easier, so I sought out a few new ones for our second. This is the deepest pile I've found and we hope the new one loves it.",5
Precious Moments&reg; Prayer Doll - Girl,Doll arrived quickly and was exactly as advertised. She's adorable & sounds great. My daughter loves her & is even able to press her belly (to turn her on) herself.,5
"Room Magic Natural 5 Drawer Chest, Magic Garden","I really do like this nice solid piece of furniture.  The problem that we had was the reversible drawer fronts did not fit correctly and rub when when you open and close the drawer.  I called Room Magic and they were helpful and gave us the option of having new fronts sent, we could have sent the whole thing back, or we could have made the the drill holes slightly bigger to lower the drawer faces.  We fixed it and I think it is beautiful.",3
"Safety 1st Complete Air Protect 65 Convertible Car Seat, Great Lakes",We looked at a lot of different car seats and found for the time we want to use a car seat and not need to buy a new one this was the one we needed.  The day we went home from the hospital my son was sitting in the car seat.  He was a little more than a month premature and weighed in at 5lb5oz and was fine.  Pillows on the side of the head were a bit too high for him for the first three months but then he grew enough to get comfortably.  He now knows when he is siting in it it is time to go!  he loves it!!!,4
Blueberry Pacifier Holder,"I've been using this bink link for 7 months now ever since my friend gave me one of hers to use. I can't say enough good things about this thing! It's the perfect length, it's cute, it clips to everything and my baby loves using it as a teether, too! The link is very well made and durable -- I'm not afraid of it coming apart at all. I love how it's ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) approved and guaranteed lead-free and doesn't dissolve paint when wet. Be warned, though... my dogs LOVE to chew on this thing and think it's a doggie toy whenever we get careless and leave it out within their reach! They've chewed through 4 of them to date but I love them so much I always end up buying new ones! It's worth the cost!",5

"Vital Baby Press 'n' Pop Mini Freezer Pots, Orange, 1 Ounce - 32 Pack","we use  them for everything.  yes they are great in the freezer. also  in the purse, the garage, the desk......  we use them for everything that could fit in them!",5
Baby Einstein Touch and Explore Discovery Book,I would like to see something very similar but with more pages. I had assumed that the 3 tab would open to another page but does not. I bought this for my grand daughter who will be 1 year on the 25th of Oct. - a few days away. She enjoyed it for the first few minutes but lost interest quickly. I think it is the kind of toy you introduce and when the baby loses interest just put it away for a week or two and reintroduce it as something new. I believe she will get more enjoyment out of it when she can follow the instructions such as touch the guitar or touch the piano etc. On the plus side it is nearly indestructable and inexpensive as well as something that can easily be packed as a take-a-long toy.,4
Antimicrobial Activity Mat,I use the hooded towel for my son and I like it so I bought the play mat too. He's 7 month old and starting to sit up and plays while he's sitting. When we go to our music class together I bring the mat and it's a good plce for him to sit because its big. I can sit on it with him too. I don't use it at home that much because he has another activity mat that is colorful and lights up and plays music.  But this one is good for bringing to places where there will be other babies.,5

BRICA Super Scoop Bath Toy Organizer,"This was a Christmas gift for my 11 month old grandson, and he loves it because his toys are right there.",5
"Babycity Suede Microfiber One Size Pocket Diaper with Snap Closure, Pink","Not like Alva diapers. It doesnt come with an insert, plus they run smaller than the alva one size diapers.",2
"Graco LiteRider Stroller, Tango in the Tongo","I was looking for a lightweight foldable stroller with good storage, a decent sunshade, and child tray that could double as a high chair.This stroller has all of that and handles very well. However, it has some design problems that could be improved upon: 1) the wayit folds up, the child tray bangs on the ground quite forcefully.  It can get dirty and seems destined to break, but it's made of flexible plasticso maybe it can take that kind of stress  2) the padded metal baron the seat back is very low--my 14 month old's head already hits it,although she sits up and doesn't touch the back usually. I was hopingto use the stroller until she is 3 and I don't know if that's going to work.3) one of the cupholders on the parent tray is so shallow that water bottlescan fall out. The other one is OK.",3

Fitted Pack N Play Sheet in Traditional Blue Print,"I am impressed with these sheets, they fit my graco pack n play perfect, they are very soft, and they are just thick enough that you can not see the print of my pack n play mattress through them.",5
"Bummis Bio-Soft Liner, Small","These things are great for dealing with toddler poo! It's stinky and sticky, so with these liners, you just pick it it up and drop it in the toilet!",5
Black Gingham Fitted Crib/Toddler Sheet,"Nothing fancy and a little over-priced for the quality (the edges aren't nicely finished, just quickly sewn onto a strip of elastic), but over-all I am happy with this fitted sheet.",4
"NUK Latex Colored BPA Free Replacement Spout, Colors May Vary","I got these as a replacement for the silicone spouts since my daughter kept tearing them while teething.  These are not as easy to rip, however, they are expensive for just one spout.  It is less expensive to buy a new sippy cups, which I have done since I found Pampers cups for $3 each and they are less leaky than Nuk.",5
The First Years Sit and Store Parent Bathing Seat and Stepstool,"This stepstool/seat/storage is great!!!  I can even put a pink tub in there to travel with and put tub toys, washcloths, lotion, shampoo, rinse cup and more.  It's a lot bigger than I expected and very sturdy.  Excellent purchase to travel with for all bathing needs and then you have a stool for the kids at places like hotels and grandmas house. :)",5
"Motorola MBP26 Wireless 2.4 GHz Video Baby Monitor with 2.4&quot; Color LCD Screen, Infrared Night Vision and Remote Camera Pan and Tilt","I'm not sure how much babies like disembodied voices, but the two way speakers are nice.  Pan & Scan is also a great little feature, you can view the entire crib as well as around it.Night-vision works well with the infra-red lights in a pitch-back room.  The baby's room had a night-light though, and the night-camera was far too sensitive.  To make up for this, we put tape over the infra-red lights on the camera and got a great picture.",5
"Boon Flair Pedestal Highchair with Pneumatic Lift,White/Orang","It's easy to clean, it looks great and I love the adjustable height function.  My 6 month-old is comfortable and happy to be in this chair after eating long enought to give me a little extra time to wash up!",5
"Dexbaby Safe Lift Universal Crib Wedge, White","My baby has AR so I ordered this crib wedge for her.  It goes underneath sheets.  However, I'm not sure if its the wedge or just my baby, but she rolls down off of the wedge by the middle of the night.  Which kinda defeats the purpose of the wedge.  I'm keeping it in there though as at least it works for a few hours and soon I wont be swaddling her anymore and hopefully she doesnt move around as much as she gets older.",3
Medela Soft Fit Breastshields 24mm - Medela 67246,"Comfortable and easier to carry than regular shieldsI like the feel of these flexible shields better than the regular stiff plastic shields. These are also slightly shorter than the regular shields which makes them more convenient for carrying in a pumping bag. Cleanup is the same as with regular shields, and so far I think they are just as durable.One star off for not making them in different sizes (different radius, i.e. 21mm) like their regular plastic shields.",4
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,Great video monitor - especially for the $.  My wife and I couldn't stand the thought of not being able to see our new baby and now we can actually afford to.  Now we just need to move him out of our room so we can use the monitor.,5
Beaba Babycook Baby Food Maker,"I received this as a very generous, surprise shower gift, for which I am grateful. As a first-time, clueless mom, being armed with this gadget made me confident to venture into making my own baby food, which I'm glad I did.The first few times I used this, I was thrilled. However, I soon realized that, although convenient in theory, this just wasn't a practical way for me to cook my son's food.Here's the kind of cook I am: I like making food, but I love when I can cook in the most efficient ways possible. When making baby food, this means I am totally willing to do the work, but would rather do it once or twice a week and make big batches to last the week or freeze for later. If that sounds like you, you should save your money--this is not the most efficient machine for that.I imagined myself whipping up quick, ready-to-serve dinners for my son in 20 minutes flat. Again, just not practical in reality. Even if you have the food prepped ahead of time, once you steam and puree it (which is not exactly what I'd call quick), it is HOT. OK, yes, I understand the food has been steamed and is therefore going to be extremely hot, but anyone with a hungry baby knows you don't really have a ton of extra time to wait for piping hot sweet potatoes to cool down before dinner is served. I've also found that the blending mechanism is just okay--not terribly powerful, not a big capacity, and I often have to stop mid-blend and scrape down the sides. It's kind of a pain to clean too. Plus, the ""pitcher"" component and lid of mine have definitely become slightly warped from the extreme heat of steaming.I thought this would be THE all-in-one machine for making baby food. However, considering my reality, it's just so-so. I have a Vitamix blender and much prefer that. It doesn't steam, but to me, doing a big batch or two of baby food in at most three steps (prep if needed, steam if needed, blend) is preferable over cooking five small, individual batches of sweet potatoes in a row, each of which takes 20 minutes in the Beaba Babycook.If I had spent my own money on it, I'd be more disappointed. It's not terrible--just not the best or most practical solution for me.",3
KidCo Spring Action Cabinet Lock 4-pack,"Loved these latches when my kids were little. Now with a brand new remodeled kitchen, I am using them to keep those upper cabinets from flying open during a California earthquake! Buy a few extra in case the springs pop off and get lost!",5
"Ju-Ju-Be Be Prepared Diaper Bag, Black/Silver","I've had this bag for about two years and chose it because I cloth diaper and knew I would need the space and I'm an over packer (I find the day that I don't bring something I end up needing it). I love this bag basically for every reason that all the previous reviewers stated.  It's HUGE, can hold everything and then some. I was a FTM when I bought it and basically packed everything possible I needed for my baby for the day out and overseas travel from bibs, nursing cover, baby carrier, extra clothes, bottles, cloth diapers, wet bag, toys, snacks, you name it it was in my bag! I love how organized you can be with all of the pockets. The mommy pocket is perfect to keep my things separated from his and also to hold little items of his (medicine, etc.).  A few gripes I have is having the the snack pocket in the same pocket as the changing mat. Just the idea of having a changing mat, where I clean my son's butt on, next to his snacks grosses me out (I usually just fold the changing mat and put it in the pocket between the main compartment and mommy pocket).  But now I have this huge pocket with just a few things in it, kind of a waste of space. Also, I have this bag in all black, as I wanted a unisex bag that my husband wouldn't be embarrassed about holding, and it's definitely showing some wear now.  There's a few scratch marks on it that make it look like I've had it for years. I think the patterned ones may be better in that respect. And finally this bag is HEAVY completely empty, so you can imagine how heavy it gets when it's fully loaded. I didn't think the 3 or 3 1/2 pounds it weighs would be a big deal but it really does, especially when you can't hang it on the back of an umbrella stroller and are forced to carry it. At one point it just got too heavy to carry, I wore my son in his sling and stuck the bag in the stroller seat. But now that my son is in full toddler mode, has no patience for baby wearing, and needs to be strapped in his stroller when we're out and about, it's a pain, especially when traveling. I wish it had wheels so I could drag it along.  I didn't want to give up my bag for a wheeled carry on and it was so heavy carrying it through airport terminals and trying to lift it onto the overhead compartments on planes. I've since had to switch to another diaper bag, that is smaller and lighter, but I miss my jujube.  I will say that it is really well constructed (especially compared to this new diaper bag that is already falling apart after 4 months of use!). Because I love it so much I'm still giving it four stars.",4
"Evenflo Triumph Advance LX Convertible Car Seat, Harbortown","We needed a larger seat since our daughter grew out of her infant seat's weight limit. I did a lot of research and this seat was given high ratings with Consumer Reports. The price was very reasonable. I love how the shoulder strap is easily adjustable from the front, that the straps are tightened by turning a dial on the side of the seat, that the seat cover is easily removable for washing, and that there is a crumb catcher right under where the baby sits. I will be keeping this seat rear-facing as long as I can. So far, my daughter really seems comfy. You should buy this seat!",5
"Mommy's Helper Inflatable Bath Tub Froggie Collection, White/Green, 6-18 Months","This inflatable tub works great for me and my little guy, he is almost sitting by himself and the tub offers a perfect amount of support.  We haven't had any problems with him being squished or uncomfortable, there is plenty of room for him to kick, splash and reach for his toys.  It is easy to inflate and drain, I only blew it up once and we have been using it for one month.",5
"DaVinci Kalani 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry",Bought matching crib and changing table.  Nice color and sturdy.  Is assembled but not in use yet (baby only 6 weeks old) but look forward to using it.,5
Graco Vie4 Stroller in Super Saurus,It is very nice. Good for shopping. A little bulkier than I thought. Had a hard time fitting it into my Mitsubishi trunk. It does well on every terrain. Would need another light weight stroller to compliment this one.,4
Bellybuds&reg; | Baby-Bump Sound System,"This is so much fun....I play different types of music throughout the day for baby, and he kicks and dances and makes all kinds of wonderful movements!",5
Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,"I liked this warmer, it is very easy to use, the water container has a nice shape that prevents any leaks when you refill it. I have twins, if you also have twins like I do, be advised that if you warm a second bottle just after the first one, the water in this unit will be warm and your bottle formula will be much hotter at the same amount of minutes than the first one.",4
Simmons Kids Full Size Metal Bed Rails Metal,this was perfect. I  love it.  my baby  girl finally has her  own  bed.  thank  you  so much.great  merchandise,5
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"Took this on a trip to Asia with our 2 1/2 year old daughter and it was a lifesaver when only squat toilets were available.  Was really surprised at the size - it really did fit in my purse (kind of a medium-sized purse); takes up about as much room as the plastic fold-into-quarters potty seat that we use in public in the US.  Bought the liners as didn't want to be figuring out yet one more thing at the moment of truth.  We normally use public facilities at home but will now carry this as a back-up in the event that we aren't near a rest-stop, or that they are dirty.  Very easy to set up and use - little one wanted to try it as soon as I took it out of the box from Amazon.  Would recommend this to anyone who plans long road trips; trips to other countries where facilities are different styles; or who would like another option when regular facilities are just too foul.",5
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"Sound quality is very good, as is range. It operates on a voice activation principle where voice has to exceed a threshold - 1 of 5 levels. I've found that these thresholds are rather high. Even at level 4, you won't be able to hear your baby's breathing, for example. If you choose level 5, you *will* hear every noise, but the monitor will be on all the time, and battery life will suffer. The unit has a nice ""walkie-talkie"" feature so that the person holding the ""parent"" unit can speak to the person in the room with the ""child"" unit. The nightlight feature is so dim as to be basically worthless. It would be more convenient if the ""child"" unit were designed to fit into a base for recharging, because one is less likely to recharge it by plugging in its adapter cord.This is a good baby monitor. It's a bit pricey for what it offers, given that $50 more will get you a monitor with video capabilities, but it does offer digitally encrypted transmissions that probably won't interfere with other devices or computer networks. The Sony Baby Call costs about $50 less, offers two receivers, but uses a much more basic communications system susceptible to eavesdropping and does not have a walkie-talkie feature.",4
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"This carrier is terrific! With my son I purchased a Snugli &amp; never used it. It was uncomfortable &amp; hard to use. With my daughter I decided to splurge &amp; try the Baby Bjorn based on word of mouth. I am now the #1 fan! This carrier is very comfortable for both Mom &amp; baby and is perfect for Moms on the go who need their hands free.  I have used it grocery shopping, in the mall &amp; in restaurants. It is simple to use, I can load my daughter in it one handed and is perfect for soothing baby when you're out and about. My daughter usually falls asleep in it. Believe the hype Baby Bjorn is worth the money.",5
Clay Hanging Keepsake Kit (Makes 2 Plaques),I really liked this kit. The instruction were clear and it was very easy to make. I love my baby's hand and foot print!,5
Gerber Nipple Brush (Colors vary),These are hard to find. Love it. Does not take up much space. Most stores only carry the double ended ones like this.,5
"Summer Infant Custom Fit Walk-Thru Gate, Tan","This baby gate is great! It is flexible, so it can be adapted to my strange arrangement.  I am confident I will continue to be satisfied, my child is not quite mobile yet.",5
Lito Baby Boys White Navy Sailor Romper Hat Set 6-12M,"I received the sailor suit in immaculate condition.  The buttons were a ship's wheel instead of the anchor, so no problem with the anchor being sewn on wrong.  The outfit was perfectly pressed.  I can't speak to size or fit as the baby is not due yet.  I bought the 6 to 12 month size rather than risk getting one that was too small.  Actually received the item in a shorter amount of time than predicted which worked out great as I had procrastinated and thought it wouldn't arrive in time for the shower.",5
Soho Spring Time Butterfly Baby Crib Nursery Bedding Set 14 pcs included Diaper Bag with Changing Pad &amp; Bottle Case,"I recently purchased the 10pc spring time butterfly bedding from Soho, and i'm utterly impressed by the quality of the product.  I'm in the process of decorating my twin baby girls bedroom and was able to coordinate other items to match this beautiful set.  Can't wait to put it in their cribs once there up. I will definitely be purchasing and recommending Soho designs to other consumers.  Thanks Soho for being affordable.  My only gripe is the price of the shipping considering i purchased two bedding sets and had to pay $17.49 a piece for shipping.  Soho there has got to be a way to decrease the shipping cost or give discounts for multiple purchases.",5

"Delta Canton Full Size Wood Bed Rails, Black","Like everyone else, I have the Simplicity Ellis Crib.  Mine is the cherry finish and these rails matched perfectly.  They also fit perfectly.  So glad I was able to find these, the bed looks really nice.  Also, if you own the simplicty crib, check into the recall.  If yours has the tubular mattress support, it was probably recalled.  Mine was, still waiting to hear what Babies R Us is going to do since Simplicity is now out of business.",5
Seat 2 Go Safari Stroller Attachment,"I bought this and would like it except it won't work on my stroller (Kolcraft Contours Double).  The 3rd stabilization bar that is absolutely important for the standing position, will not attach because the distance is too great and wouldn't sit parallel to the ground if I could get it on.  The seat is about 3-4 inches too high for my daughter's head to keep from hitting the parent tray.  It's a bit of a pain to attach, but not impossible and doesn't require tools.  This would be best on a stroller with 2 handles instead of a bar handrest.",3
"John Deere Fleece Blanket with Embroidered Satin Trim, Pink",Soft and totally girly with the John Deere flair but would rather not have paid double the price just for the label.,4
"Kolcraft Cozy Soft Cradle Pad, Lily",purchased this for our lil' ones craddle and am very happy with our purchase. it is exactly what I was looking for. love that it's a bit thicker than most pads and it is inexpensive. very happy with this purchase.,5

"Dreambaby Extra Tall Swing Close Gate with Extensions, White","We ordered this gate to keep two cats out of the bedroom while allowing the door to stay open for ventilation.  I have to say it exceeds my expectations.  It's sturdy, easy to install, easy to open and close and latches securely.  The cats haven't haven't even thought about getting past it.",5
Luvable Friends 2-Pack Waterproof &amp; Flat Quilted Multi-Use Pads,"This pad works in that it absorbs the liquid and protects what's underneath.  However, when my daughter had a tummy bug, the vomit collected in the quilting and it took about three washes to get the smell out, but I couldn't get the stain.  I did use spray on stain treater and colorsafe bleach with the detergent each time.  I won't be using quilted pads anymore.",3
"Gentle Naturals Tummy Soother, 4 oz.",This is the only thing that works when my son gets sick. They are crazy for discontinuing this product. There is nothing out there on the market that is natural and works like this does.  It just can't be replaced.,5
"Leachco Wrap Strap Anywhere Safety Strap, Red",This strap really works! It is wide so that the baby cannot get out of it. It really prevents her from standing up in the cart. It also works with regular chairs if you're at someones house to keep baby/toddler safe.,5
Constructive Eating 3 Piece Construction Worksite Utensil Set,"eeh, overpriced for quality. Bought as gag gift, not for use. Doesn't appear it would hold up well to childs use. Colors not as bright as anticipated.",3
Playtex Baby VentAire ADVANCED Standard Bottle 9 OZ - 3 Pack: Girl Colors,"This is my favorite bottle for many reasons: I love that it comes apart completely, so I know that it is very clean each time - opposed to traditional bottles that seem to have an impossible-to-remove film that gathers around the bottom of the bottle after time. Love that it is silent when my baby drinks from it because the air is being vented at the bottom of the bottle - opposed to the noisy bubbles and sputters from traditional nipple venting which is not ideal for babies going to sleep. Definitely reduces gas and air in my baby, which is awesome.Cons, as others have mentioned, they can leak when the bottom seal wears out, but you can buy replacement seals on the playtex website pretty cheap.  To me, it is worth the little extra work, even though I am a very busy mom.",4
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"I was pretty excited to get a video monitor was good ratings for such a good price, and it worked pretty well, but a few months in, the monitor went blank and after extensive investigation, I found a wire on the camera was split open like someone had sliced it with a knife. It was the weirdest thing, and very disappointing, and a waste of money. I guess I should have spent a couple hundred dollars and I would still have a monitor.",1
"My Brest Friend Original Pillow, Bluebells","I love this pillow.  My Brest friend allows me to breastfeed comfortably, and occasionally allows me to be hands free while nursing.  I also like that it straps on to my body so that I can stand up and sit down without needing to rearrange everything.",5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock n' Play Sleeper, Yellow",,5
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack, Lavender or Citrus","This product made no noticeable difference in our nursery. I also placed one on our cat litter box with the same result. As others have posted, there is no way to stick them anywhere, so you end up buying velcro stickers to put them around the house.",1
"Carters 5-Piece Girls Diaper Bag Set - brown/pink, one size","This set is so spacious and stylish. It matches easily to anything, and at the same time it isn't to girly for a man to handle either (My wife made me say it...) Very durable and good capacity, overall an awesome buy.Pros: Not to girly, Durable, Large capacity.Cons: Insulated bottle carrier isn't very insulated, nor is there much room for an ice pack.",5
Fisher-Price Laugh and Learn Jumperoo,My baby loves this toy.... he loves the musical tunes.  It was easy to assemble and the instructions are very clear.,5
Vulli Products - Sophie The Giraffe Teething Ring - Gift Boxed! - 100% Natural rubber,"Well first, they didn't send the vanilla one and my baby hated the rubber taste. He doesn't really use it much even though he's teething. I wish I had gotten the traditional Sophie instead.",3
"Charlie Banana Reusable Feminine Pads Liner Butterfly, Butterfly","For the first time in my life, I decided to start using reusable pads. I honestly had no idea if I would like them, or if they would work. Well, I put them on, and they feel soft against my skin and are really cute! Only time will tell if they're as good as disposables, but right now, they're winning me over with the sheer comfort factor.",5

"Itzy Ritzy Peek-A-Boo Pod, Licorice Swirl","This is the third carseat cover we tried (fourth if you count throwing a blanket over the carseat), and we are finally happy!  Nothing interferes with holding the handle.  The elastic fits securely all the way around our carseat (Chicco Keyfit 30).  We can see baby while we're holding the carseat.  When we get the carseat in the car, we can quickly and easily take the pod off.  It's not bulky and easily fits in the diaper bag.",5

Graco Baby Einstein Discover and Play Entertainer,"My 4 1/2 month old loves this item (and so do I!)  It was easy to assemble, and baby loves the fact she is sitting up and exploring on her own.  She especially loves the animal sound buttons.  I highly recommend this item!  I am so glad I purchased it for her.  She is so happy!",5
Evenflo Portable Ultrasaucer,"I wouldn't have made it without this wonderful invention! At month 3, I put my son in it (with a blanket behind him to help his balance) and he LOVED it! At first he didn't know what anything did but within a month he had it all figured out. Because of this &quot;toy&quot; I was able to actually wash bottles and stuff while he played in it next to me! Now my son is 10 months and he still loves to walk around the outside of it and play. THIS THING WAS A GOD SEND! THANKS EVENFLO!!!!",5
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","My almost 6 yr old son got this when he was 1 or 2 and it is still working great.  We've replaced the batteries a few times, but since getting it, he started staying in his room easier and still  turns it on if he wakes up in the middle of the night.  My younger son is not as enthralled by the turtle (they each have one), but does like it.  He has never been as concerned about being in his room alone or in the dark like my first son. Great product.",5
"Disney Care Center Play Yard, Alice In Wonderland",I love the pack n play however besides the theme the only other reason I bought this one over others was for the extra storage..the storage just kind of hangs there there's no support and just looks sloppy if you actually put anything in it.,3

"ERGObaby Original Baby Carrier, Galaxy Grey",So glad I bought this! Very good quality and much more comfortable than my Moby wrap I was using. It is pricey but I feel that it was well worth it.,5
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman","The assembly time was probably about 20 minutes, it wasn't very difficult to put together. It also has two levels in addition to the napper and the changer. It really sturdy and durable because my 3 year old sometimes climbs on the side of it. The material is vinal so it's easy to wash. The only thing is that my daughter is growing quickly out of the napper/changer. She is three months and will probably use that portion until about 4 1/2 months then I will have to see if I can detach it.",5
"Fisher-Price Cradle n Swing, My Little Lamb","We really love this swing. My son prefers the cradle shape to the bucket up right seat. He naps and plays in it. He loves the mirror on the underside of the mobile. The three positions is nice and we definitely use this feature. There are a lot of song options too. Amazon sold this for the best price especially with super saver shipping. The only reason we didn't give it 5 stars the music automatically stops way too soon. Our soon would wake up and start crying as soon as it would stop. My only regret is that we didn't buy this sooner, like before he was born.",4
Boon Dive Bath Tub Appliques,These foamy tub toys are great. My 10 month old daughter loved them as soon as they came out of the box. She figured out how to put them on the wall or the tub itself and she likes to put them inside other containers in the bath. They are easy to play with and they don't have any chemical smells to them.,5
Bugaboo Cameleon Adapter for Select Maxi-Cosi Car Seats,"Okay!  So admittedly, I rushed into using this adapter before understanding how the car seat worked.  We have the Maxi Cosi AP and it fits fine.  However, there is a separate set of button that release the car seat.  It is not the same release mechanism as getting the car seat out of the base.  There are two buttons (right in front of your face) that will release the car seat.",5
"Munchkin 2 Pack Fresh Food Feeder, Colors May Vary","My baby LOVES this thing!!Bananas happen to be her favorite so far and I found an easy non-toxic way to clean it. First, I rinse the larger pieces of banana out of the mesh. Then I pour a little bit of 3% hydrogen peroxide (stuff you buy in the first aid section) into a cup, just enough so I can fully submerge the mesh part in. Then I add a tablespoon or two of baking soda, stir, and let set for about 15 minutes. I stir the mesh thing around occasionally while it's setting because the baking soda likes to collect at the bottom of the cup. Once it's done setting, I pull it out and give it one more quick 15 second rinse under the sink and it's clean!!",5
Eddie Bauer Car Seat Protector,These work great in my car since I have leather seats it helps to Protect the seat from food spills,5
Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Latex Nipple - Slow Flow - 2 Pack,"My 7 week old daughter is breastfed exclusively and I haven't been able to get her to take a bottle at all. I even went so far as to spend $10 on a single bottle (Avent) and it didn't work. These nipples work! I'm not sure if its just the latex nipple or the whole playtex drop in bottle system.. but its working.. (occasionally), so I'm not changing anything. :)Of course, she is stubborn and will only take this nipple from me if she happens to be in the right mood and will only take it from Gramma if she has cried long enough to be absolutely sure I'm not there.. but at least it is clear that she knows what to do with it, so she won't starve if I leave her with Gramma.. Though she might if I left her with her daddy. She won't take it from him at all. Still, one step at a time.. I'm glad that we have at least found a bottle she is willing to try on occasion. If she is really hungry and the person giving it to her is patient enough, she will drink the whole bottle. :)PS. I didn't buy mine online because of reviews that recommended buying them from the store since they aren't the same when you order online, so I can't comment on the quality of the product if bought online. I found mine (nipples, nurser, and breast milk storage set) at Target and they were in perfect condition and work wonderfully.",5
Playtex Playtex VentAire Advanced Standard Bottle Gift Set,"I got these for my son and I must say, I really loved them.  They are kinda of a pain at first with all the pieces but they are worth it and eventually the pieces don't become a hassle :)  If you can do bottle liners all the time you can handle these!",5
Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobile,"We have a co-sleeper in our bedroom, so we can't use this to help our son fall asleep there.  But after discovering he was very entrained by it during the day, we tried it last night in his future crib in his nursery and he was entertained for over an hour before falling asleep.  Then I was able to move him asleep into our co-sleeper.  Not a horrible solution, but it would be nice if they had other versions of this that could fit on the Arms Reach co-sleepers.  We will keep using it and would buy again in a heat beat, because he loves it!",5
Baby's My First Photo Album of Family &amp; Friends,"This is a great item for a baby far from grandparents. I am close to mine, but everytime we look at the book, I believe it make the family members a familiar sight! I also added photos of  common animals and pets to mine. Definitely a winner!!",5
Graco 3-in-1 Potty Trainer,"We bought this because our 4.5 year old son wouldn't poop on the potty. It has helped tremendously and he is finally going.  The seat is made out of a Croc shoe-like material or a Bumbo seat.You are able to easily take out the grey potty part and it easily fits on the seat of the toilet.  I like this feature-it has made it easier for our son to transition from the little seat on the floor to the toilet without being worried about the cavernous toilet bowl below him (I think that is what his hang-up was about pooping in it). Being able to take it apart has been good, but for a younger child it would be a problem.  It sort of slides apart easily (doesn't latch in or anything) and would probably be tricky for a newby at potty training.",3

The Art of CureTM *SAFETY KNOTTED* Raw Olive &amp; Baroque - Certifed Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace w/The Art of CureTM Jewelry Pouch,"Loved this!

I would recommend this to everyone",5
Kel-Gar Snug Tub - Elephant,Bought this for my baby granddaughter's recent visit.  My daughter is so happy with it that she wants to take it home with her!  Nice size.

"Kick Mats - Extra Large Auto Seat Back Protector in Black, 2-pack - The Best Solution to Safeguard Your Car Seats From Dirt Marks and Stains Caused By Kicks and Spills - Effective and Affordable - 90 Day Risk-free Money-back Guarantee","This fits our Honda Odyssey 2012 perfectly.  The top and the bottom straps both have buckles, similar to those that you will find on a hiking back pack.  No elastics!  I couldn't find any photos of the bottom strap and didn't know where the buckle was located but purchased anyways and am glad I did.  The bottom buckle is 4-5 inches from the sewn location to the panel so you won't be sitting on it.  The bottom strap can be tucked into the seat cushion where the back meets the bottom and you can't even tell it is there (visible yes, feel no) (don't tighten it all the way, leave it a little loose on the bottom).  I will probably buy it again as a gift for one of my siblings in the near future.We do a lot of hiking and my two kids (3 & 6) use the back of the seat to push them up into their car seats and this will work like a charm to protect the seat.The only change I would make would be to reduce the distance between the sewn locations on the top strap a little so (only occurs when the distance between the headrest poles is shorter than the distance between the sewn locations) no scrunching of the panel occurs. Not a big deal but it has a little riffle.  Another minor change would be to add a stiffener rod (semi-flexible) to the top lip of the panel so that the corners won't droop (no other manufacturers have these either)  They are not drooping now, even in 90 degree heat, so maybe not needed.  The great part is that the vendor contacted me and thanked me for the input and will consider the ideas.  So far great product and no issues.  Even if something happens in the future, it's an easy fix to sew back on because they are straps and not elastics.",5
"Lansinoh 20265 Disposable Nursing Pads, 60-Count Boxes (Pack of 4)","I highly recommend these pads! I have breastfeed 3 children and have tried many different brands and this is by far, the most comfortable. Playtex is very soft and comfortable, but they are too thick. Middle is soft but outer rim is scratchy and can irritate sensitive nipples. If the pads were too thick, they would make me feel sweaty and unclean. Its important to me that my pads are thin and breathable for hygiene purposes.Lansinoh pads are thin and super absorbent. 2 stickers that help keep them from bunching and in place. In my experience, if they are not sticking well or slipping around in your bra, it may be the type of material your bra is and not the pad. I learned this the hard way years back. Now I try to always buy thin cotton nursing bras.",5

"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","I bought those bottles, and though they require some extra work as far as the cleaning and the assembling is concerned, they were very good with gas!Yes, they sometimes leak, but so does every bottle on the market,believe me, I tried them all, particularly Avent!I don't know if you can do something for your gassy baby, but I definitely don't understand all this hype about Avent bottles, for instance. They seem, as my mom put it, as any regular bottle, they don't seem to filter the gas at all.It might be that my baby is less gassy than others and I am blessed ( but I wake every two hours to feed my baby girl, so there, you have it!)but at least they attempt to, because they look more different than others.Playtex weren't bad either, but Avent, come on?! Just regular ""European"" bottles! I come from Europe, so try harder to impress me!The Dr. Brown's bottles are very easy to hold, esp. during the night, they are good with gas, or at least attempt to, nicely built and leak less than other! The shape of the nipple is the one that ressemble the most, I would say, to the shape of the breast nipple! Only by buying them, you can decide if they work for you or not!But it worked for us, it seems logical for the babies to be less gassy since these bottles come with a filter for air!!!Amy Leea",5

Sassy Pop n' Push Car,"We bought this car for my 6 month old daughter for Christmas.  The first car we purchased didn't work when we pulled it back and let it go.  However, she loved the size, color and popping balls so much (and we liked the price) that we exchanged it for a new one.  The exchange was quick and easy at no cost to us.  The new car works great.  I can tell that this is going to be a toy that she will continue to grow into as well.",4

15 Plastic Alligator Grip Suspender Pacifier Binky Mitten Bib Toy Holder Clips 10 - Tested Free of Harmful Chemicals (Variety Color Pack),These are AWESOME! Received them quickly. Great for making pacifier holders to match every outfit. Really affordable. So much cuter than just plain suspender clips.,5
Gerber NUK Orthodontic 10-oz. Bottles - 3-pk Colors MAY Vary,"The Gerber Nuk Orthodontic bottles are cute, and overall well designed. Initially, the nipples on the bottle may be difficult to figure out which way to put in your baby's mouth. We quickly learned that the hole in the nipple should be on the roof of the baby's mouth (if you see the vent hole pointing up towards your baby's nose, you got the nipple hole in the correct direction). The bottles are easy to clean, and are shaped short and wide, thus allowing our daughter to easily hold it by herself with both hands without tipping over.My one gripe with the bottle is that because the nipple hold placement is on the side of a nipple as opposed to directly on the top, if you shake the bottle with formula in it, the formula leak out, even with the cap on! We learned this the hard way when absent mindedly tossing a full bottle into a backpack, and it tipped over sideways! If you're conscientious about keeping your bottles upright, you wont have a problem. Also, you will need to either use your finger to block the hole when mixing formula, or use a spoon. Most people will most likely overlook this one inconvenience, as having an easier time feeding your baby trumps over all.The 5-ounce bottle set comes with the slow flow nipples. The 8-ounce bottles come with medium flow nipples. For those who think these bottles are too expensive, often Gerber sends out coupons that include $3 off any Nuk Bottle. At Target, these bottles are generally priced around $5 per bottle for either the 5- or 8-ounce size.  The fast flow nipples are sold separately.Outside of the bottle cap leaking problem, I would recommended this bottle to my new mommy friends! Recommended!",4

"Carter's First Year Calendar, Laguna","This calendar is printed on high-quality paper and comes in a thick plastic protective sleeve, which will definitely be handy for storage. The stickers allow you to customize the calendar based on birth date and there are also some for milestones. Especially nice are the sections at the front to talk about mommy and daddy's history and the family tree, as well as a page dedicated to the day the baby was born. Each month has the same fill-in questions (I believe another reviewer wrote them out), and a place for a photo. What I like best, besides the quality, is the super-cute, timeless, unisex pattern of jungle animals, which is subtly woven throughout. It's just an adorable keepsake that is easy for those of us who really wish we'd do a more detailed baby book but just don't have time. You will be so glad after a year that you used one of these calendars, and this one is excellent and very affordable. I will be buying this for others as a shower gift.",5

"Carters Easy Fit Sateen Crib Fitted Sheet, Ecru","These sheets look nice, feel soft, have a nice color, fit well and hold up to a lot of washes.  I've never had issues with holes, tearing and/or fading.  I still use my 3 years olds on his toddler bed and bought the same ones for his new baby brother.  Well worth the price.  Would and will buy again.",5
Bright Starts Having a Ball Pop and Roll Roadster,"I have a one year old, and I have not had serious problems. I actually really like the product, we got the opportunity to test it out, and all in all it is pretty good. He really loves cars so this was a really great product, it is easy for him to understand, it moves around easy unlike other ride-on's; the sounds and buttons are also a cute addition. My main problem was the hood, it was all easy to assemble however the hood was constantly falling off, I have had it only a week and I already lost the hood. That isn't really a big deal however and overall I would recommend this product.",4
Zo-li Bot Straw Sippy Cup 6oz,"Finally!  I have been searching for a sippy cup my picky almost-10 month old will actually use.  This is it!  My daughter is breastfeeding and hasn't had much experience with a bottle.  When she does get a bottle, unless she's very hungry she just played with the nipple.  So we tried, on our doctor's advice, to transition to sippy cups when we wanted to introduce water.  I tried several brands including, Avent and Tommee Tippee, and she could either get the sucking or the tipping of the cup but not both at the same time.  This allows her to just focus on sucking and not worry about tipping the cup!Features:* The straw is fabulous with a weight at the bottom.  No matter what way she gets the it to her mouth she gets liquid (unless the cup is empty).  As with any straw sippy you need to be careful how you clean this.  I found the cleaning brush to be helpful.  This area is my biggest concern though since I don't want to breed bacteria.* There's a flip lid to keep the straw clean when traveling, etc.  One minor drawback here is that it doesn't click open very well so often my daughter accidentally closes it and I have to open it back up.  Might not be an issue with an older baby.* Good size, weight, and nice handles.  The cup is very easy for my daughter to manage including when it is full.  Many sippy cups are just to heavy with liquid for a 10 month old.The other drawback that I've found to this cup is that it CAN leak.  The packaging says this so it's not a surprise.  The design just doesn't allow for a complete seal.  However, if you put the lid on properly and watch that your child doesn't leave it on it's side for a long time this is not really a big issue.All-in-all I love this sippy.  So much so that the others have been put away in the cupboard (until she learns to suck and tip simultaneously) and I've just ordered another Zoli!",4
Safety 1st Sleepy Baby Nail Clipper,"Is there a scarier mundane task than clipping a newborn's nails?  Yikes!  While it is always a hairy proposition, this clipper works great.  The little light highlighting the nails is a Godsend!  The crescent clipper area is very small, too -- perfect for teeny hands and feet.",5
"Gerber Plastic Pants, 18 Months, Fits 24-28 lbs. (4 pairs)","We used these covers for potty training over training underwear and they've been fantastic. They are sturdier than the Baby R Us version.  Haven't had to replace them yet, can't say the same about the BRU version! Loving Gerber.",5
"Inglesina 2011 Fast Table Chair, Marina","Only problem: if you have a skirt on your table it is difficult to use.  You have to untwist it all the way and hope it will fit. Then hope there's enough leg room.This works best on tables without a skirt.  It is PERFECT for our picnic table.  It is very sturdy, great colors, comfortable, and just super easy on the road!",4
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange","Decided to get this stroller over the regular city mini, because we wanted durable, all-terrian wheels that will last and not wear down since this stoller holds up to sixty pounds. (Plus we hope to use it until our son is 3 or 4 years old) It is also not as bulky or expensive as the City Mini Elite.Other pros:-easy to fold up-easy hand break-Huge multifold sun shade, plus rear roll up cover that also both good for rain.Cons:- a little heavy, not easy to carry up stairs, even when folded.- storage bin is shallow, difficult to get large items in there, such as a diaper bag- can tip if you hang a heavy bag from handle (it says not to hang stuff on the handle, but I do sometimes now that my son is heavier)",4
"Nuby Bug A Loop Teether Bead, Colors May Vary","My baby loves this toy. She started playing with it at 6 months or so when she began to really hold things and teethe on them, and at 14 months she still enjoys holding it, chewing on it, and dropping it. It's durable and has lots of fun colors and textures. I would definitely recommend this toy.",5
Munchkin 36 Count Plug Covers,This pack was inexpensive and was plenty enough to cover the outlets I needed with a few left over. Rounded so little hands can't get a good grip but fairly easy for an adult to remove baca use they have a tiny slit in the top. Nice to feel more secure without fighting to plug in the toaster.,5
Ameda Purely Yours Breast Pump - Carry All,"Great pump and so easy to use!  A friend recommended this instead of the Medela set and I'm very happy with my decision.  When I was in the hospital, I used the Medela pump and just found that there were a lot of pieces to put together and take apart each time.  There is very little disassembly with this pump, which makes it so much faster to get started.  I would highly recommend this!",5

"Contours Options 3 Wheel Stroller, Berkley","I love it, it looks expensive  and have the same features of any other expensive brand name  . it is really affordable, perfect for long walks, my little girl loves to be looking at me when we walking .  a little heavier and big for my sizes ( I'm really petite 95 lb and 4.8 ), it is definitely not the perfect stroller for traveling , it will take a lot space on your trunk.

Lotus Travel Crib and Portable Baby Playard,"The crib itself is wonderful.  It sets up and breaks down in a snap.  The Lotus cotton fitted sheet, on the other hand, is a hassle.  It is apparently too tight for the mattress so it cannot fit without the mattress folding up.  Looping the Velcro tabs through the sheet holes and attaching said tabs to the bottom of the crib takes 5x as long as actually setting up the crib - pretty much any time saved is lost just because of an ill-fitting sheet.  However, I would still buy this crib if I had to do it all over again.",5
"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large","Love this little guy, such a cute toy. This was a gift for my 2 year old granddaughter. She really enjoyed riding on it, it was the perfect size for her little legs. I would recommended this item.",5
Summer Infant Secure Sight Digital Color Video Monitor,"Some of the other reviews made me hesitant to order this monitor, but I'm so glad I bought it.  We've been using this about two months and love it!  When expecting our second child we decided to buy a second video monitor (the monitor for our first child is also Summer Infant Video Monitor - we've had it almost two years and love it as well).  The handheld unit is the perfect size, has excellent picture and we love the rechargeable battery.  It's made it extremely easy to both watch and hear our daughter.  We had no complaints at all about this product and highly recommend it.",5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,"I started sleeping better my first night with this body pillow. Before I had anywhere from 3 to 4 pillows taking up a lot of room on our queen size bed. Now I use this plus one other pillow I use for under my preggo tummy - I sleep with the ""spine"" of the pillow along the back of my body - always. It doesn't work well for me when it's in the front. I saved the box it came in so when we travel I can take it with me. It may seem a little excessive, but hey, a good nights sleep is worth lugging around a pillow whether it's in the car or on the plane.",5
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator Crystal | #1 Tested Snot Sucker,"This is a great tool, and much better (more effective) than the simple bulb suckers they give you in the hospital. The opening is fairly large, so it probably would not be great for newborns, but works very well on our 4 month old. The only drawbacks I would say is that it doesn't go quite as far into his nose, so we have to position it exactly right to be able to suck everything out. Also, the little hose attachment is removable- this is great for cleaning, but not so great with a smart baby who figures out that he can make this unpleasantness stop by pulling on the tube which pulls it off of the mouthpiece. It's pretty much a two-person job to hold the baby's head/arms while another person sucks, but boy it works when you get everything positioned correctly.",4
Dr. Brown's Formula Mixing Pitcher,This is a must have for parents who have formula babies.  It makes mixing bottles efficient and there are no clumps!  The mixer itself is a breeze to clean and is sturdy.,5
"Summer Infant 3-Stage Superseat Highchair, Green","Really an excellent product. It has an insert for the seat, which means it'll fit a young one (2-4 months) and then when they get older, you pull out the insert and it'll be usable for several more months. I love that the table turns so you can bring whatever you want to the attention of your child. There is room to add more toys as well as food/drink. You can see it here [...]if interested. (The video is mainly to show the spinning wheel toy, but you can see the seat, table and toys too.)",5

Especially for Baby Under the Sea Turtle Sponge,"Taking a closer look at it once it was received , which came well with in the specified time frame and at no additional cost either i might add ;) the foam seems awfully soft and a bit thinner than in the picture but none the less should do it's prescribed job just fine ! This was inside a sealed bag with a Baby's R Us logo on it , so i'm guessing they're the usual retailer / manufacturer of it . If that matters or makes a difference to any of you reading this . It's also available in several other colors and patterns but this one suited our grandson , he seems to like turtles and he is a lil' boy so blue is fitting , obviously . The scalloped form with in the sponge should help keep him steady during bath time just fine and as intended . $15.00 well spent I think and will cut down on our laundry costs since we're not using 3-4 towels to form a makeshift cradle for him during bath time , SCORE !",4
Sassy Crib and Floor Mirror,"My 13 week old loves this toy! It was the first toy she started playing with. Around 8 weeks she loved looking at herself in the mirror. Now, she is reaching out to touch the bugs and has figured out how to spin the black and white ball in the ladybug. We set it in her pack-n-play and when we have to change her she is so captivated by this toy she doesn't notice she is being changed.My only problem with this toy is it tips over so easy. It is not sturdy on its base whatsoever! It is constantly falling over when she is playing with it. I really wish it had a flat, sturdy base and then it would be a five star toy.",4

"Luvable Friends Infant Pillow Case, Traditional Blue Print","This pillow case  is just as advertised, it's very soft.  I use it for my hourglass shaped pillow that I sleep with between my knees.

Fisher-Price Precious Planet Melodies and Motion Soother,"This soother is so pretty.  I used it both for my son and daughter.  Happy animals, soft sounds, adjustable volume. When my son was several months old, he figured out how to activate it himself.  It's great, he would wake up in the middle of the night and I could hear that he turned it on.  Helped him sleep.  Even took it on vacations.",5
"Munchkin High Capacity Drying Rack, White","I had the First years spinning drying rack and thought that was great, but WOW does this one take the cake!I love the fact the spokes do not come off, they fold down. BIG plus for me.Its very sturdy, and less flimsy than the first years one too. I had to use a piece of electrical tape on the middle post on the first years one so it was thicker so the top rack didnt slide down, but that was no biggie to me and it got a lot of use thats for sure.So i came on here a while back looking to get another, as i just had another baby so i needed a new rack for his bottles and breast pump parts, and i would use the other one for my 2 year old's sippy cup parts and stuff.Well when i opened this one and set it up i fell in love with it, tossed the first years one and ordered another of these!I have them both sitting on my counter next to each other and could NOT be happier. I put up pictures, if you want to see.Holds a TON of weight, i have 4 to 5 breast pump funnels on the top at a time, along with the diaphragms, duck bills, breast cushions, bottles. Then on the bottom i put more bottles, nipples, collars, you name it. If i wash it for the baby it goes in there and it does its job perfectly!I HIGHLY recommend this drying rack. You will NOT be disappointed!!!",5
bumGenius One-Size Snap Closure Cloth Diaper 4.0 - Bubble,"I don't have experience with the previous model but I do like this one a lot. Never had a blowout with them, easy clean-up with the diaper sprayer, usually no stains left after I wash, if there are any left, dry in the sun, you will be amazed how all stains will disappear. Multiple washes will also remove stains. Never tried other brands of cloth diapers because I was so happy with these.",5

"P'Kolino Little Sofa Lounge, Red","I ordered the P'Kolino sofa-sleeper for my 2 year old grandchild. It's the perfect size for her (is great for 1-3+ ages). When I ordered I found that it was quite the popular item and was on backorder. I had to wait quite awhile, but it definitely was worth the wait. Babycakes of Scottsdale was just great about keeping me abreast of the sofa availability, and the minute it was available it was shipped. I will definitely order other items from Babycakes through Amazon Marketplace again. This sofa is just great for your toddler to sit and look at or read books, and in the sleeper position is awesome for a little sleepy one. Thanks Amazon and Babycakes of Scottsdale!",5
Sassy Pop n' Push Car,"Smaller than I thought...didn't look at measurements but it is really cute, my 18 month old loves it and it turns out to be a good size for her anyway.",5
"The First Years 4 Pack Ziploc Sippy Cup, 10 Ounce","I usually use the take and toss cups and have never had a problem aside from possibly having a small drip from the spout after hours of it sitting upside down.  These leak everywhere through the twist on part.  My son complained about one of them not working and after checking it out I actually had to re-poke holes in the spout with a safety pin because they weren't done correctly.  Definitely not cheap enough for all of these issues, they are going into the recycle bin..even the ones we haven't used yet.",1
Tiny Love Sweet Island Dreams Mobile,"This mobile is excellent. My baby likes it very much (toys and music) and I can leave the baby lying in bad and looking at mobile for 30min and more and do other things at that time without worrying. Great, great! I would recommend such toys to all my friends with babies.",5
"Thirsties Duo Diaper Snap, Mud, Size One (6-18 lbs)",I love these diapers!  Cute colors and prints.  Plus they are very functional.  Love the gussets.  They keep breast fed poop very well contained! They don't fit my chunky baby as well as BumGenius 4.0 though,5
New Mommy Advice Cards -24ct- Party Supplies,These cards were placed on the tables during my baby shower. It was a great side item that people could share their advice with me. I collected them at the end and have placed them in my keepsake box. The people attending my baby shower comented on how nice the idea was.,5
"OXO Tot Flip-In Hamper, Gray/Green","Just like all OXO designs this looks great, clean and modern and works perfectly for baby's dirty clothes. The lid is easy to lift or refit  with one hand and the colors are stylish--just as pictured.",5
myBaby SoundSpa Portable,"Me and baby have a bedtime routine of bath, than pjs, than rocking and listening to the sound machine.  She loves it.",5
Snuza Halo Mobile Baby Movement Monitor,"This was featured on """"The Doctor's"""" and I did not hesitate to purchase this for my 4 month old granddaughter that very day. What peace of mind-knowing that when you sleep your baby is protected. It's like having insurance. Easy to use and the baby does not even know its there. What a great invention! Thank you!",5
Munchie Mug - Top Rated Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Ages 1 to 4 years. Made in AMERICA. - BPA and phthalate free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top,"This is the best snack cup.  I love that it has a cover that you can screw on instead of the trap top to keep things fresh and keep bugs out.  But the trap is the best part.  My son can spill anything out of the others because he likes to hold them from the top and turn them over.  But with this one, since the trap is further down, he can't hold the trap open with one hand and spill everything out by turning it over.  It's a lot bigger than others too, so you can put a good amount in there.  Our son was scared to put his hand in at first because he couldn't see inside very well, but he learned to love it and carries it around all the time now.  This is one of the best buys we've made.",5
"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","I ordered the Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag in Pewter because I finally realized that with a toddler I needed a bigger bag than my regular purse. I wish I'd invested in it earlier in my son's life but better late than never! Originally, I thought all those pockets were over-kill but after using them I've discovered how handy they are. My son'sDabbawalla Lunch Bag, Out of this Worldlunch bag fits easily inside the main compartment with room for a coat and an extra toy in addition to what I normally lug around. I would easily suggest this bag to someone looking for a diaper bag or a cute laptop bag (my 15"" MacBook Pro fits but it's close).Orgainizing:All the pockets make it easy to organize my son's items and my things; finding a specific item is quick and painless. One of the inside pockets houses my purse, another is a perfect fit for myKindle Paperwhite, 6"" High Resolution Display with Built-in Light, Wi-Fi - Includes Special Offers, sunglasses for both me and my son along with sun screen and a hat are housed in a third inner pocket. The inner zipper pocket is my ""medicine drawer"" holding a few different pills, etc. The front top zipper pocket is perfect for my cell phone, a pen, and lipstick. While the bottom zipper pocket holds six different types of toy cars. The back pocket with the zipper has some sort of antimicrobial lining called ""agion"" which, I presume is for hauling around dirty diapers. Instead, I use it as the pocket I store emergency snacks for my boy. The two outside insulated drink pockets work very well, at least better than I expected, at keeping the drinks warm/cool.Cons:The bag is HUGE! My friends laugh the first time they see it and call it my duffle bag. Personally, I think they're just jealous. :) But since it is so light-weight (1.8 pounds) it is not a back-killer. If only it came with a shoulder strap it would be perfect. However, it will be easy enough to snag one from a different purse and attach to the Studio Diaper Bag using the stroller strap hooks.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My 4 month old son is teething, and I've tried all kinds of teethers, but none seem to satisfy him. So, when I read the reviews for Sophie, I figured all these people couldn't be wrong. When I first got her, I was glad that Sophie is not hard, inflexible rubber, which she looks like from the picture. She is much softer, like the rubbery consistency of a dog toy, which some people have already commented on. My thoughts regarding Sophie's likeness to a dog toy is not a far-fetched comparison; this is especially so with the way the squeaker sounds. Our dog LOVES this thing! I have to hide it, but he goes sniffing for it. Anyway, when our son first got his hands on this thing, it went straight into his mouth. And he smiles every time Sophie squeaks, which is so cute to see. He also smiles when he ""gums"" Sophie's body, especially her legs (hooves, actually). So, judging from the way my son puts it in his mouth, and smiles when he does so, I'd say she was a worthwhile purchase, but it is very pricey, nonetheless, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It's handmade, made of natural rubber (from the sap of the Havea tree), hand-painted with food grade colors, and the finished product takes 14 steps to complete. It's been around since 1961 (or 65, I can't remember)and hasn't changed since. But even though she'll be a keepsake, the price is exaggerated. If you want a teether that works, however, Sophie is worth it.",4
Samsung Ezview Baby Monitor,"We received this as a gift. Thank goodness we didn't spend money on it. It works and we can clearly see our son and hear him as well. No issues with range. The problems, power cords have got a short in them now so they need to be adjusted every time. The unit has only been used for 7 months. Secondly, the damn noise alarm feature...why Samsung? Why not have a turn off setting. Vibrate and Beep only...plus the lowest setting on vibrate is comparable to a 2.5 on the Richter scale.",2
"Gund Baby Lena Lamb Musical Toy, Jesus Loves Me","My preference would be 2 1/12 stars..5 stars for cuteness of the lamb, but 0 stars for durability...yes, it said be careful not to overwind, and I WAS careful about that but the music mechanism still broke the EXACT same day that my niece received this as a present..products for childrens should be DURABLE...",3
Regalo Easy Step Extra Tall Walk Thru Gate - White,Overall good. I like the screws to secure it in place. Big dogs tend to break out still. That's the only down size.,4
"JL Childress 4 'N 1 Car Seat Travel System, Black","The bag material is really thick and sturdy.  The strap is nice.  Unfortunately, it broke the first time I used it!  I was flying alone with my son and on our return trip the zipper broke at the airport.  When we got home, my husband was able to fix it but we're not sure if the design of the zipper will hold up in the long term.  Otherwise, we like it.",3
"Stork Craft Venetian 4-in-1 Fixed Side Convertible Crib, Cherry",This crib is beautiful.  When compared to much higher priced furniture it looks just as good for half the price. I wasnt sure what to expect and was pleasantly suprised.  All the pieces came with it and no trouble to assemble. My husband and I (mostly my husband) put it together in under an hour. I would definitely recommend this set.,5
Exergen Temporal Artery Thermometer MODEL# TAT-2000C,"We have used this for a few months now. We have found it reliable for picking up significant fevers. For this it is fast, simple, and nearly perfect for small children.However, the results are not consistent enough to identify low grade fevers. Our doctor recommended monitoring one child as a chronic moderate fever might indicate a problem he about which he was concerned. This thermometer didn't seem to work for that.I'm glad we have it. But it's not quite what we had hoped for.",3
"Redmon For Kids, Kids Folding Camp Chair, Red",I ordered this chair for my 18 month old grandson.  He has a little trouble getting in and out of it but that should get better as he gets bigger.  Like the cup holder. It locks so it will not collapse on him.,5
Summer Infant Contoured Changing Pad Amazon Frustration Free Packaging,"This changing table pad is much better than the one that came with the changing table.  Fits perfectly. Waterproof, easy to wipe clean.",5
"Sassy Developmental Bath Toy, Catch and Count Net","This is a great little set.  My LO loves the 3 fish and still plays with them after many months.  Note: The net itself is lightweight and hollow with small holes along the black and white striped ring - I suspect the purpose is to drain any water that might get caught in the handle.  My daughter seems to enjoy sucking the water out of the holes, so we had to take it away from her.  Otherwise, good bath time fun.  :)",4
"Lambs and Ivy Enchanted Forest Decorative Pillow, Tan/Brown/Green",This pillow is so cute and so soft.  It compliments the other Lambs and Ivy products I have purchased for my grandson.  Quality is excellent!,5
"Dream On Me 2 in 1 Bassinet to Cradle, Blue",I would have returned this but ran out of time - for only about $55 it wasn't too terrible but the wheels do not roll together and you cannot take the fabric off to wash it. I would not recommend this unless you can't afford anything else.,1
"Clek Ozzi Portable Booster Car Seat, Licorice","simple nice seat but does not fit so back to amazon it went.  pretty basic seat, no cupholders though.  decided to just convert my 5 year old's britax booster into a backless booseter instead- since the latch belts are not adjustable on the clek it makes it not able to move so you can position it just so so you can buckle child in.  Britax booster has floppy belts for the latch so you can move it to either side when installing.",4
3&frac12;&times;5 &quot;Granddaughter&quot; w/Teddy Bear and Baby Carraige,"The party I sent the gift to seemed pleased and thanked me. I liked how it looked very much and was glad I had purchased the picture frame. Also, it arrived in good time as posted.",5
"Prince Lionheart BoosterPOD, White Base/Lemon","We bought this booster for our 2.5 year old daughter.  We're very happy with the purchase and she liked not having to sit on her knees when at the table.  WRT to the issues others have noted, the booster fits under the side of our table and we have a pretty standard size dining room table.  Also, to note we don't use the seatbelt and haven't been concerned about it being difficult to clean.  If they get gross, we might just remove them altogether.  The rest of the booster cleans up just fine.",5
"Safety 1st Grip N' Twist Door Knob Cover, 4-Count","We actually purchased these by accident, based on an inaccurate product photo of the kind of doorknob covers we actually wanted to purchase. Once we found out that they no longer carried the ones we really wanted, we decided to give these a try. Not only are they difficult for my 6-year-old to operate with her small hands, my 2-year-old son can remove them from the knobs with very little effort. The two halves snap together over the doorknob, and can be removed by squeezing them together at the right point (or as my son figured out, by hitting it repeatedly with a heavy toy). I certainly wouldn't depend on these to keep little ones out of unsafe areas.",2
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Quarter Moon","I bought the quarter moon night light for my 4  year old daughter for Christmas 2010. We have a turtle light from another company, but my 4 year old and 2 year old daughters always fight over who gets to sleep with the moon.The light has always worked great, but I noticed around April 2011 it would only charge if something heavy was put on top of the light as it wasn't making a connection with the base when placed on the charger. I contacted the company, Blue Moon Lights, and received an immediate response with some trouble shooting tips. I responded back and the representative (I think it was one of the owners of the company) responded multiple times. He offered to replace the moon at no charge. I let him know my kids fight over who gets to sleep with the moon every night and let him know we alternate with another light up product. He proceeded to ask me if my kids were 2 boys or 2 girls (I told him girls) and he said he included something in the replacement package that would help with our nightly battles and emailed me the tracking number. When I received the package, I was shocked to see the elephant light in addition to the replacement moon. In his previous email, he even gave me a discount code if I ever wanted to purchase another product from the company in the future. My kids were excited as well, but now we have nightly fights over who gets to sleep with the elephant :)Hands down, this is one of the best customer service experiences I have ever received. I'm so happy to see that there are still companies that see the value in customer service and I will be recommending them to all my friends with kids!",5

"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Small, Circle Bear","I'm a father of two, one is currently swaddled in this.  She sleeps in this.  No crying!  Buy a few as your wife will want to wash it when the infant spits, throws up, etc..",5
"HALO SleepSack 100% Wearable Blanket Applique, Elephant, Small","The baby uses this and I love tucking him into it. The cotton is soft and had held up well after many washes. It is just heavy enough for a well heated room, light enough for summer. If you keep the temperature low in winter, you might want something heavier. All in all, I would suggest buying two so you have once in case there is an accident, if you know what I mean.",5
"Swaddlebees Newborn Simplex All In One Diapers, Giraffe","These diapers are great!  My husband and I fell in love with these diapers when we went from using disposables to using them.  The prints and colors are perfect for babies outfits too.  Now that our little girl is almost 7 weeks old and 12 pounds, we are still using them.  However, she is sleeping through the night as well as wetting pretty heavy, so we use a disposable diaper at night time (only have done this for a few days).  If I wanted to buy additional inserts and use those, we could, but I just needed to use the disposable diapers we already had. We are going to be using size ones as well with our little girl.  We purchased 13 mostly gender neutral colors/prints so that we can use them with our second baby as well...amazing how much money you will save not buying disposable diapers.The simplex diapers work great for us!  I couldn't be more happy with our purchase.Suggestions:Purchase more than we did (13) because you will go through more than that in one day at times...I'd suggest 15 at the minimum if you wash every dayPurchase a wet/dry bag so that you can temporarily keep your diapers together for the wash later (you can use it while traveling as well)Purchase a diaper sprayer for your toilet to rinse off poop",5
"Gerber Waterproof Pant, 2 Pack, White, 12 Months","GERBER MAKES REALLY GOOD BABY PANTS TO USE WITH CLOTH DIAPERS. I WILL ALWAYS USE THEM. THEY WILL NOT LEAK, EVEN FOR OVERNIGHT USE.",5
Sound N Lights Monitor with Dual Receivers,"This monitor was highly recommended to us... unfortunately it has given us nothing but grief.Regardless of what channel or volume it is set to we constantly pick up a high pitched static feedback.  There are only 2 channels to choose from on this unit, one of which picks up the static worse than the other.  Unfortunately the less static filled channel also picks up a neighbors signal (and they have a constant crying baby, ugh!!!) so a lot of times I will check on our daughter to find she is fast asleep while the mystery baby is bawling its head out via our monitor.  In order for me to sleep at night, we have to run our fan to create enough white noise to drown out the static.Going to shop around for another system...",1
Replacement Tubing (Retail Pack of 2) for Medela Pump in Style and New Pump in Style Advanced Breast Pump - 100% BPA FREE,My tube got mold after a while so I order this replacement. I can't complain. It does the job for me and the price is just right.,5

Fully charged. Did not have to spend 100 dollars for new monitor. Really strong battery better then original battery.,5
BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Bassinet,"I have no complaints about this product at all. It works exactly as expected (although it could be a little cushier). I didn't expect to be able to use this past 4-5 months of age, so that was not a negative for me. I love the portability! Fantastic to keep in the car for impromptu naps while visiting friends or family. It's also great for allowing your little one to sleep comfortably on a church pew. Just knowing I have a safe, clean, contained space for the little one to sleep when away from home makes it worth every penny to me!",5
Medela PersonalFit Breastshields (2/pack) - Large - 27mm,"I ordered the 21mm breast shields & it says 21mm on them, but I measured them to the ones I already have (standard 24mm) & they are the SAME size. I don't know what's going on, but I want a refund.",1
Gerber All In One Waterproof Trainer for Boys 2T - 3T (28-35 lbs.),Ordered a 2T for my two year old and my 10 year old niece can easily fit into these!! Gerber is normally not OFF like this on the sizes-- SENDING these back and demanding refund. TERRIBLE......,1
"Medela Contact Nipple Shield, Small","I couldn't get my baby to latch at all during first 24 hrs of birth. All the nurses tried to help and he'd get on for maybe 2 seconds, we have multiple nursing lactation consultants come in to help and they had no luck. Finally after 24 hrs one of them recommended this because my poor baby was frustrated and starving.One of my nipples is still sore but that's because of how I am putting him on I think because my other one I can barely feel now when he's on and he's almost 2 weeks old.  I used lanolin on the sore one and it's not so bad when I get him at the right angle.This is really easy to clean to. Between feedings just wash with little soap and warm/hot water then I keep it in a sealed bowl near my bed for feedings.  It helps when you can't get baby to eat and you still want that bonding and contact!",4
Cloth Diaper Sprayer--styles may vary,This product is great. I used to have Bumginus spray shower and thought it was good. But I moved and left it at the house so I had to buy again. And my husband bought this.Water pressure  is very strong and you can clean even infant poop. I love it!,5
Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor,"I purchased this monitor as a video monitor newby.  My first son's room was right across the hall from us and I could easily here his cries, but with our second son's room down the hall and a 3 year old to keep up with as well, I knew I needed some type of monitor.  I chose a video monitor by Summer Infant because after MUCH research, they seem to have the best reviews on several websites.  The modern look of the Baby Touch appealed right away, but the reviews were what kept this one at the top of my list.  I was hesitant after hearing a few reports of interference with Wifi because the main time I see us on the computer or watching Netflix on the TV would be when baby is asleep. As soon as the monitor came, I hooked it up in the nursery and brought the receiver downstairs.  My husband and I tried it out without any setup or issues. It was plug and play!  I love the talk back feature and see this as something we will use to talk to each other and eventually to the baby.  I will probably even move it to the room our boys will share when they are bigger and we have them share bunk beds.  The next thing we tried was the pan and zoom feature.  It worked really well and since we have never had any type of monitor the video quality looked fine. I will be able to see and hear baby and that's the point, right?  The last thing we tried out was having the monitor on and searching on the internet.  No problems.  My husband even streamed Hulu without any problems.  Then, I turned on the TV with our Wifi Netflix as well with no issues.  Baby is still in our room since he is only a few days old, but as soon as we move him to his crib I know I will sleep better with this monitor by my bed.  The only thing I haven't tested is the range.  I'm hoping it will reach in our backyard in case our toddler wants to kick the soccer ball during little man's nap time.  I'll update this review when the time comes.  So far so good and I am glad that we spent the money on this monitor.  I know we will use it for several years.",5
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue),"It works as advertised... and when the little part that goes against baby's nose got into the garbage disposal for a day or two, when we pulled it out, there was no damage. Amazing.We call ours the snot hookah. It causes the least trauma of any nasal suction device I've yet used.ETA:We've now had this two years. I don't use it often but it is still very effective. Word to the wise, however... little babies just turn their heads and it's not too hard to use this. Using it on an active and seriously pissed-off toddler is like trying to play the bagpipes while washing a cat. Wear protective gear.",5

Sock Ons Clever Little Things That Keep Baby Socks On! 6 - 12m (Baby Blue),It's one of those things that you wish you'd invented! Sock Ons were worn by our newborn for at least his first 8 months. Now I'm back to buy more for #2 and to give gifts for other friends with kids. This is simply a MUST HAVE for your baby's wardrobe!,5
"JL Childress Gate Check Bag for Umbrella Strollers, Red",We got this to gate check our chicco umbrella stroller when the bag it came with ripped after being used a couple times.  It has worked great.We are about to travel for the first time with our double stroller and bought the maclaren bag for our Maclaren Twin Triumph .... it is HUGE.  So I decided to see if the Maclaren Twin Triumph would fit in here and it does.  I am so happy $12 is a lot better then $56.  I also love that this is red and easy to spot at gate check.,5
Sassy Pop n' Push Car,We took it out of the box and she barely would let me get it out of its packing (just twisty ties really). I was surprised that after showing her how to pull it back and watch it go she understood the concept. She played with it for 30mins straight! : ).. too cute. She loves crawling after it. For the price it is a must have!,5

"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","Between school lunches, field trips and Sunday family picnics, lunch boxes are one of my family's main must-haves.  We need something that actually keeps the turkey and yogurt cool but is cute enough that my kids get excited about lunch.  We bought three of these lunch bags - all different animals - and my kids love showing them off while digging into their meal.  They are the perfect size for lunch and for storing between meals.  Thanks again Skip Hop for making something darling AND practical!",5
Baby Einstein Octoplush,"The baby that got this as a gift loves it. He loves the colors, lights and music. Definitely recommend this product.",4
"UPPAbaby G-Luxe Stroller, Black Jake","We bought this for airline travel and shopping and love it.  It is very easy to fold, very light and seems comfortable for our daughter.  The basket is also large and easily accessible.  A great feature is that you can detach the hip strap from the shoulder strap which allows our daughter to lean forward and see more.  I am not sure I would buy the color red again because it is very bright and may be responsible for her not falling asleep in it yet. You also can't run with it unless you lift the front wheels because they become unstable quickly but that's not what we bought it for anyway.",5
"OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Pink","This dispenser is seriously good. My wife and I got tired of the cheap, junky wipes dispensers that come free with most baby wipes. I have a ton of OXO products in my kitchen already and love their practical design. This dispenser delivers exactly as you'd expect from an OXO product. The gasket seals the wipes well and keeps them moist longer than the cheap, free dispensers. It can be easily operated with one hand, the lid opens and closes with a slight press. The dispenser has some heft, so you won't be moving it around just by pulling wipes out. The weighted piece in the middle keeps a wipe popped up like a kleenex and ready to grab without snagging a couple.I couldn't be happier with the product. We are using it with Pampers Sensitive wipes and it works flawlessly. The window on the front isn't really important since we're opening it so often, I notice when the stock is low. Another thing to note is that the dispenser is mostly white - the color selection only changes the color of the gasket and weighted piece.",5
Sassy Earth Brights Wooden Spring Bouquet,"There is absolutely nothing fancy about this rattle, but that's what I love about it. As it is made of wood, it makes a nice ""clacking"" sound, which my baby really likes, and the flowers offer a traditional rattle sound, crinkle sound, and various textures. It's easy for my baby to grab, but she is a little older (8 months when we bought it). If your baby is younger and still NEEDS many thin loops or easy handles to get tiny fingers stuck in (in order to grasp objects), then this rattle may be more difficult as all of the pieces are chunky. Frankly, the primary reason I bought this was because it felt like a cleaner, safer, more earth friendly alternative to the many plastic rattles available, and it has met all of those expectations. This is not a toy that will hold attention for hours at a time, but it will keep her entertained long enough to stop fussing in a waiting room or a line. Finally, my baby does actually play with this rattle instead of just chewing on it, so if you're wanting a chew toy, this probably isn't what you're looking for (besides, would you want to suck on a block of wood?).",5
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner, Pink",I was using disposable placemats that stick in place.  This placemat is certainly more economical.  It covers the perfect amount of space so that all of my baby's food stays on the placemat and not the table.  I thought the spill catcher would get in the way but it doesn't and in fact catches some of the food he drops.  Definintly worth the money.,4
Ikea PATRULL Non-Slip Bath Mat - Green Crocodile,"I really like this bath mat. I read the reviews and although there were some concerns posted by other users, I decided to try it for myself.The mat doesn't cover the whole bottom of the tub, but I expected that. I don't think it really needs to cover every inch anyway.We do have a slightly textured tub surface, so the mat doesn't stick the way a regular suction cup would stick to a flat surface. Other users are correct when they say the mat doesn't stick to the textured surface but that it doesn't move either. But I have been putting the mat in after I begin filling up the tub, and when I pull the mat up after my son's bath, it does make a popping sound. So although it doesn't glue itself to the bottom of the tub, it does stick fairly well to our textured tub.I guess this bring me to my final comment. A lot of others have complained that the mat gets moldy after a few weeks of use. We haven't had any problems with this, because we shake the mat off and hang it up after every bath like the directions say to.This mat serves its purpose with no issues thus far and my son seems to like it too - that's good enough for me.",5
Fisher-Price Coco Sorbet Soothing Motions Glider,"We got this as a hand me down and even though it's a few years old, it works great! I love that it's portable and uses batteries so I don't have to keep it near an outlet. It glides smoothly and the seat can be rotated to change directions of the glide. Our little on loved it for his first 4-5 months of life and slept well in it for naps. I don't recommend it for sleeping through the night just because baby doesn't sleep flat on his back in this glider.If you're looking for more baby gear reviews visit the website AllMomsArePerfect.com It has down to earth reviews from a perfectionist mom who does a ton of research on baby products. You'll find a stroller shopping guide, baby carrier guide, and what to expect after the delivery (stuff no one takes about).",4
Knit Crib Sheet - Sage,"I have this sheet in sage, and I think it's a great sheet. I've had absolutely no problems with shrinkage and have washed it multiple times in warm water. I like this sheet a lot. It's very soft, and it's not as cold to the touch as regular sheets are, which is nice for baby.",5
"Nuby No Spill Sport Sipper, Colors May Vary, 10 Ounce",We bought this cup for our twin boys (Toddlers) and they started using it. One day my son just dropped the cup (it was full) on the floor and it cracked and became useless. This is unfortunate as it was new and have not been used frequently at all. I would not recommend this product at all.,2
"Charlie Banana Diaper Liners In Roll, Natural, 100-Count","I was so disappointed in these because I LOVE my Charlie Banana cloth diapers. I thought these were going to be more like the pads you can put in and then dispose of...but, alas, they are not.I don't know what these are supposed to do exactly.  They are rough and I wouldn't want them touching my bottom!  They are super thin so they don't absorb anything either.  What can I do with them now that I have them???",1
"Summer Infant Soothe and Sleep Bassinet with Motion, Sweet Lamb","This beautiful bassinet makes the perfect first bed for an infant.  It has rocking motion that can be timed, lulling sounds like a mother's heartbeat, and it looks beautiful to boot.  It is on rolling casters that can be locked so baby can be moved from one room to another depending on the parents' needs.  It plays music and sounds and has a timer so that baby can be soothed into sleep.  On top of that, it has a large container underneath where diapers or other necessities can be stored.  I fell in love with this bassinet at first sight and I can't think of anything more perfect for baby's first sleep.",5
"The Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Aqua Stripe)","Why I like the Woombie:*It keeps your baby's arms and hands snug and warm inside, so she won't flail around or scratch herself. But it also allows some space for her to gently stretch her limbs. It mimics the womb (hence the name!)*The cotton is soft and breathable, and prevents overheating.*The Woombie comes in tons of colors, and several different sizes and fabrics for warmer or cooler weather. The original Woombie sells for $25.99.*It's the easiest thing ever to use! Just put baby inside it and zip it up!*It's won awards from PTPA, Moms Best, and Creative Child.Read more of my baby product reviews on my blog over here:[..]",4

"Playtex 3 Pack BPA Free VentAire Wide Bottles, 9 Ounce (Colors may vary)",This bottle was perfect for our little one.  She wasn't a burper and this bottle helped a lot with her spit up.

The bottle consistes of 5 different parts so when you was dishes you need to make sure you have all the parts before emptying the sink.,5
"Sassy Seat Doorway Jumper, 5 Toys","We did not buy from amazon- however my baby loved bouncing in this. It is safe and comfortable, has lots of fun toys, and is easy to wash. You must have a molded door frame for it to secure to. Adjust height when baby is NOT in seat. Very strong and sturdy. My daughter (now 4) loved this and was great entertainment while I made dinner. Also didn't take up much room. My son will likely love this too when he is old enough to use it!!!",5

Fisher-Price Luv U Zoo EZ Clean High Chair,"I got this as a gift for Christmas, as this was when my son was about to turn 5 months old.People keep writing that their 16 pound baby does not have room to move or grow, , my baby is bigger than average and still has room to grow and is comfortable, not squished.The colors are nice, it is sturdy and easy to clean.I like the way it buckles together, it is very easy to get my son out of the seat.The directions say to push the tray onto the chair, much easier and nicer on the chair if you either pull the side handles or push the Fisher Price button on the front and slide it on.I do not like that it only has two wheels in the front, I wish it had two in the back also or something, it is very hard to move out of the way or to move period.Folding it up is difficult, as you have to LAY it down on its side (the directions tell you to do this as well) and then fold it, and then it DOES NOT lock. If you have a closet, maybe it does not matter to you that it does not fold but for someone without a closet to hide it away in, it makes it a little bit of a safety hazard if left folded but not propped in between things to hold the bottom from falling.I do like it though, i wanted this to match the Luv U Zoo Jumperoo.The seat cover does not seem to hold onto the seat very well, it says in the directions to insert side clips into slots on seat, but what slots are they talking about? If you try to put it anywhere besides where i have them, it does not work at all. So yes, I do have them in the right spot, it just does not hug the seat tightly.My son loves the colors, tries to look at the patterns and animals while eating in the chair.Good idea, but needs some improvements. I really wish it was easier to move.*******Had to send the seat to Fisher Price for manufacturing problem. The chair would not open and click into place unless i put my FULL (130 pounds) weight onto it. I did this for two days, the second day it would not even click open so I had to return it. Fisher Price was very helpful and sent me a refund check as soon as they received the chair. Not sure what the problem was, but the return was easy and they were very helpful.",2

"JJ Cole Satchel Diaper Bag, Green Arbor",This bag is stylish and has great compartments. However after four months of regular use the vinyl around the metal handle loops began to crack and shred. I knew over time they would rip right off the bag so I emailed Jj Cole customer service and they got me set up quickly with a new bag. Unfortunately they made me destroy the one I was using in order to send a new one which left me without a diaper bag for about a week. Their customer service was top notch though!,3

"Safety 1st Table Edge Protector, Medium","We've got two of these for an oversized coffee table (top and bottom edges), and they're great.  Very padded, my son has fallen on them many times and never hurt more than his ego.  Our coffee table is on the smaller end of the large size, and while it's a little loose, it stays in place well and still does the job.  These came with small corner pads to protect the bumper, which have also stayed put and been particularly useful, since our table has sharp corners.",5

Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"Spend a little more and get a better one or simply stick with an audio only monitor, as that is basically what you are getting with this one. There is no night vision, I could not even make out a blob for my daughters bed, The audio was acceptable but not great. We were gifted a Samsung monitor for our son and it is flawless. I went in search of a monitor for our daughter, who is 6, after we moved into a home where our bedrooms are 2 floors apart. It offered her a little more security. We ended up with the levana for her and while it does not compare to the samsung, it gets the job done for $80 less. The Infant Optics needs massive improvements.",1

"UPPAbaby Infant Snugseat Insert, Cream/Grey",I have been using the Uppa bassinet for my 8week old baby. I ordered the snug seat so we can start going running. FYI before the snug-seat my baby would slip through the side when using the stroller seat. With the Uppa snug seat my baby has great head support also super snug  and very comfortable. The snug seat is soft and thick to give support in the stroller. Now I don't worry about my baby slipping out or feeling uncomfortable.,5

Eddie Bauer 4 Piece Crib Set Little Builder,"This set is so adorable. The pattern is cute and the colors are great for the new little baby boy on the way.

"Gerber 5 Count Heavyweight Gauze Prefold, White","These are great burp cloths! They wash very nicely, however they take a little longer to dry completely.  I can dry a load of jeans and towels in 45 minutes but for some reason these will come out slightly damp on the same amount of time (with just baby clothes). I didn't know that when in the hospital, you will also get a bunch of these.  When I took my little boy home, they told me to take a bunch of blankets and these diapers (burp cloths).  I use one every time I nurse him for milk overflow (to much info I know, but they work great!) I wash them almost every day because i use so many and they hold up nicely. I also put one on the changing pad in case he decides to give me a shower, or decides he just wants to show me how well he poops.",4

bumGenius One-Size Cloth Diaper Twilight,"new to cloth diapering- trying to figure out if its right for you?- check out this link to help break down the lingo and facts: [...]. if that link doesnt work- i will copy and paste the info at the bottom of this review. And now- MY two cents....I used disposable first as my baby was too small to fit into his ALL-IN-ONE BumGenius pocket diapers. He grew into them once he reached 10 lbs. (around 1 month old). Originally I only had 20 diapers but quickly purchased another 20. The total of 40 diapers ran around $650.00. If you do the math, thats what you will pay for dispoables in the first 5 - 6 months! I wash them on average twice a week and with each passing month they are circulating more slowly (as my baby's bowels function more regularly and effeceintly). They are holding up very well so far. VERY few leaks. Actally had more leaks and blowouts with the disposable diapers- also more issues with diaper rash. They go on with ease- the velcro makes them just like disposable diapers. Once I have removed the used diaper I simply place it in my Planet Wise Hanging Wet/Dry Diaper Bag. I initially feared there would be smells through my house from this type of diapering. There is NO SMELL. I have asked visitors and no one even knew I was cloth diapering due to a dirty diaper smell. To wash, I use a special detergent on them: Charlie's Soap Powder or Rockin Green Cloth Diaper and Laundry Detergent. Until the baby begins on solids, soiled diapers can go right from the wetbag to the wash- just add a presoak and extra rinse as you follow the washing instructions. Once you are getting solid bowel movements- you can use liners and shke solids off into a toilet. Warning- even if liner says ""flushable"" DO NOT FLUSH- its not worth the plumming bill!These diapers make cloth diapering as easy as disposable with the obvious $$$ benefit. I dont know why people are still using disposable diapers. REALLY, what a waste of money!HERES THE INFO FROM THAT LINK IN THE BEGINNING OF MY REVIEW:Curious About Cloth?Get the Skinny on Today's Cloth DiapersToday's parents make hundreds of decisions for their little ones with a combination of instinct, friends' advice, and research. Even with the recent surge in sales of new types of cloth diapers, many parents remain unaware of the latest developments in cloth.  Curious moms are going to the Internet to research, but basic information is still somewhat hard to find.There have always been economic and environmental advantages to using cloth diapers. Clearly, having diapers that can be washed and used again saves (a lot of) money and keeps disposable diapers from filling up landfills. Even the most expensive and fancy cloth diapering system will save the average family $1,000 or more over disposables. Unfortunately, many moms today still envision cloth diapering as squares of cotton, safety pins (eek!) and plastic pants.CuteyBaby wants to help!  Here we summarize the general categories of modern cloth diapers and give you the pros and cons of using each type:The ""Wrap with Prefolds"" diaper:Bummis Whisper WrapThe closest thing to traditional cloth diapering of all the modern diapers. The Wrap (also called a ""Cover"") is waterproof, typically PUL (Polyester Urethane Laminate) fabric with elastic edges. Some Wraps put the PUL between layers of cotton for a very soft feel. The Wrap usually closes with Velcro or snaps so you can adjust fit. Absorbent layers - which could be cotton, hemp, bamboo, or microfiber - are placed inside the wrap to hold liquid. Some moms attach the absorbent layers with a Snappi closure. A ""prefold"" just refers to the old kind of diaper with thickness down the center.Hemp Babies FlatsSeveral manufacturers make squares (""Prefolds"" or ""Flats"") that you fold in thirds to use inside a Wrap. Prefolds and Flats can be a variety of materials. Cotton and hemp are popular. At changing time, some moms will just switch the absorbent layers and re-use the Wrap/Cover if the baby is only a little wet.Pros: Cheap - the least expensive of cloth diaper styles. Flexible - Moms can adjust absorbency by adding more layers.Cons: Putting them together requires extra time, effort.Examples: Wraps: Bummis, Thirsties, Imse VimsePrefolds/Flats: Swaddlebees, Bummis, Green Acre Designs, Hemp BabiesThe ""Wrap with Fitted"" diaper:Kissaluvs Fitted Cloth DiaperThis diapering method is similar to the ""Wrap with Prefolds"" approach except it has a fitted absorbent layer. Several manufacturers make fitted diapers in cotton, bamboo, and other natural fiber blends. The absorbent fitted diaper may have Velcro or snaps to close, and the wrap goes over it to form a moisture barrier.Pros: Better absorbency and comfort than ""Wrap with Prefolds"".Cons: Sort of like putting 2 diapers on, need to buy more sizes, longer drying times than flats.Examples: Fitteds: Kissaluvs, Swaddlebees, Baby Beehinds, ThirstiesWraps: see aboveThe ""Pocket"" Diaper:Bum Genius Pocket DiaperPocket diapers are made with an outer PUL waterproof layer, inside wicking layer, and ""stuffed"" with washable absorbent pads (called soakers, doublers, boosters) from an opening in (usually the back edge of) the diaper. It is the most common design because it can be loaded up with absorbent layers that stay relatively in place. There is typically a soft interior material, which gives the baby healthier skin and a dryer feel. Pocket diapers are often ""one-size"" designs that can be adjusted to fit babies of different sizes.Pros: Selection - Many options with snaps, Velcro, different soakers. Adjustability - fits a wide variety of infants. Absorbency can be adjusted by stuffing in extra soakers.Cons: Requires disassembly before and re-stuffing after washing. Some fleece insides may stain. One-size designs can be bulky at the small settings and may not fit up to potty training age.Examples: Happy Heiny, Fuzzi Bunz, Bum Genius, Smartipants, Blueberry, Rocky MountainThe ""All-In-One/All-In-Two"" diaper (AIO or AI2):CuteyBaby All-in-One Cloth DiaperThese diapers are usually all one piece but sometimes have a snap in soaker, making it an ""all-in-two"". The easiest type to use, they require little or no assembly and, like all cloth diapers, can be washed in a regular home washing machine. Outer layer is waterproof and typically PUL polyester or nylon fabric and the inside usually includes a multi-layer microfiber (also called microterry) or cotton soaker for absorbency. Some AIO/AI2 diapers come in sizes, and other are adjustable ""one-size"" designs.Pros: Simple - Very easy to use, no stuffing/assembly needed.Cons: Often require longer drying times, may not have enough built-in absorbency.Examples: Dream-Eze, GroBaby, CuteyBabyDiaper DialogueGetting started with cloth diapers can be confusing! Different manufacturers may call something by different names. To help you sort things out, here are a few of the most common terms:Soaker: The soaker is the highly absorbent portion of the diaper. A soaker may be a completely separate piece that is either laid or snapped into the diaper, or it can be partially or fully attached. Soakers usually have multiple layers stitched together to form a long pad shape (can be rectangular or contoured). Also see: DoublerDoubler: A doubler looks like a pad and is an absorbent soaker that can be added to a cloth diaper if you are having leakage problems or for times when extra protection may be needed such as overnight. It ""doubles"" the absorbency of the original soaker, hence the name.Booster: Like a doubler (above), but lighter-duty. Boosters ""boost"" the absorbency of a soaker, hence the name.Liner: This is a super-thin (paper-like) layer that some moms like to put on top, inside their cloth diapers. Liners are disposable or flushable and usually come on a roll. Liquids flow through to the diaper as usual, but liners keep the poop from staining or sticking - you can flush or throw them away at each diaper change.Snappi: A special ""T"" or ""Y"" shaped plastic closure to secure fitteds or contours (like a fitted with no elastic or closure) on the baby (replaces diaper pins). Snappis are not needed for Pocket or All-in-One/Two diaper styles.One-size vs. Sized/Fitted: Some diapers have adjustability built-in, others come in sizes. Usually you sacrifice some comfort at the high and low end of the size range for ""One-size"" diapers. Sized diapers will give the best fit, but you will need to buy more as your baby grows.  Check out our Cloth Diaper Comparison chart to see how a size ""medium"" fitted diaper compares to ""one-size"" diapers in a few of the top diaper lines.Wet Bag: Many moms like to have these washable, waterproof fabric zipper bags for dirty diapers. You can also just stash some plastic grocery bags in your diaper bag to bring home dirties. Wet Bags come in a variety of sizes and large ones are nice to have near your changing area to hold the day's diaper laundry.Fabrics:PUL: Polyester Urethane Laminate (PUL) is used as a waterproof outer (or layer) fabric for many Wraps, Pocket, and All-in-One/Two diapers. 100% Polyester interlock is laminated (could be 1-2 mil thickness) on one side and becomes waterproof but remains breathable. Good quality PUL can withstand very high temperatures and should last for 100s of washings. Note: we have heard both P.U.L. and ""pull"" as pronociations.Microfiber/Microterry: Microterry fiber is a low-lint, soft fiber that is ideal for use as a cloth diaper soaker, doubler or booster. It is the most common fabric used for Pocket diaper soakers. Good quality microfiber has a velvety feel and typically contains 80% polyester and 20% polyamide fibers. Microfiber is 3-4 times as absorbent as cotton for the same bulk and will dry faster.Suedecloth: Used as a lining in many pocket and All-in-One/Two diapers, suedecloth is typically 100% polyester woven material that has a soft feel. It resists staining and wicks away moisture to the inside of the diaper.  The fabric will not hold moisture making cleanup a breeze and keeping baby's skin drier than cotton.Microfleece / Microchamois: Thin, soft fleece is used as a lining in some pocket diapers. This is usually 100% polyester or sometimes recycled plastic fiber content. Microfleece and microchamois (pronounced micro-shammy) have a soft feel against the skin and pull moisture in to the soaking layers. They do stain more easily than other lining fabrics.Cotton: Our old friend cotton still plays a big role in diapering. Organic cotton is a popular soaker/inside material and is used for fitted and contour diapers (that require a cover). Cotton is very slow to dry and may require up to 8 washes before it reaches full absorbency. Organic cotton is grown without chemical pesticides, which costs more, but is kinder to the environment. However, organic and ""regular"" cotton perform the same in diapering.Hemp (fleece, terry): Hemp is stronger, more absorbent, and more durable than cotton and most other fabrics. Hemp on its own is not soft enough for baby's skin, so most hemp fabrics are 55% hemp with 45% cotton. Hemp also carries natural antibacterial properties. Hemp requires several hot washes to reach full absorbency (called prepping), and it will shrink A LOT - usually in one direction. Hemp absorbs like crazy and many moms swear by hemp Doublers/Boosters (see above) for night time cloth diapering.Bamboo (fleece, velour): Bamboo has a silky texture and is very absorbent. It is a naturally antibacterial fiber that will not lose its softness after countless washes. Bamboo fleece and velour are used in fitted diapers and as interior diaper fabrics. Along with hemp, bamboo is kind to the environment due to it being easily renewable and bug-resistant. Bamboo and hemp are still quite expensive fabrics, and that will show in the price of diapers that use them.Wool: Many experienced cloth diapering moms swear by wool outer layers. Wool requires some special care to keep its water resistance, and I wouldn't recommend it for a mom who is trying out cloth diapering for the first time. However, if you are really dedicated to using natural fibers, this is the only one with built-in moisture resisting qualities.What do you do with the poop?Modern diapers do NOT get soaked in an icky pail of wet stuff! Thank goodness!! Most cloth diapers will have the instruction: ""shake off solids"" and then wash in hot water with 1/3 the normal amount of liquid detergent. If you are new to cloth diapering, I recommend getting some disposable/flushable liners with your first purchase. If you line the diapers, then you just lift off the little liner thing and trash or flush it. If no liner, then you sort of shake poops out into the toilet. Some moms like to have their dirty diaper bin in the bathroom. So at changing time they take off the dirty dipe, set it aside, put on fresh diaper - then walk into the bathroom & shake out / flush, leaving the dirties in a container or laundry bag in the bathroom. Other moms (myself included) have two bins by the changing table - one for trash (shake out or put liner in there) and one for the diaper laundry. You can wash every 1-3 days, depending on preference, and how many diapers you have.Want to try it out?Lots of cloth diapering moms (myself included) started out just wanting to cut down on trash & expenses and were willing to ""test drive"" cloth for part-time use. If you want to try cloth diapering, pick the type of diaper that suits you best and buy enough for one day's use (usually 6-10 diapers or 4-6 wraps plus prefold/fitted). Maybe pick two brands and buy a few of each so you can see what you like best. Once you see that it's ""no big deal"" you can expand your collection - or ""stash"" of diapers, as we say. If you don't like it, there are several sites where people buy pre-owned diapers in good condition. Simply take a quick photo, post your items for sale on Diaper Swappers or eBay, and make your graceful exit from cloth.Note: If you have a cloth diaper retailer near you, DO go to a specialty shop. The people there can be extremely helpful and will answer any questions you have about the different types of cloth diapers.",5

"green sprouts Baby Food Mill, Green","We previously had a KidCo baby food meal.  It worked great.  We decided to try the Green Sprouts because it is eco-friendly.  Well, it belongs in the recycling container.  The blade/strainer does not stay in place when grinding foods.  We have cleaned up many messes as a result of the blade/strainer popping out.  The seal is marginal at best.  Grinding anything with moisture causes liquid to flow down base and on to the countertop.  Finally, the mill leaves a good portion of unground food.  Easily an inch worth of compressed food is left unground.  Very disappointed. It might make great compost, minus the steel blade.",1
"Summer Infant Snuzzler, Ivory","I love this product but I have to give it 4 stars. I have used it on my last two kids and always end up detaching the head piece from the rest of the product because it's just too much. It's great for the first time I bring them home from the hospital and they are still so tiny, but within a week it takes up too much space in the car seat. The headrest portion is great and I use that piece for months, but the rest ends up getting put away somewhere. So, it's nice for a week or so until your baby outgrows it.",4

Cloud B Two Piece Combo Set - One Twilight Turtle &amp; One Twilight Lady Bug,"We bought the sea turtle for our 6 year old daughter, who was still having difficulty going to sleep by herself. (I know, I know - we consulted the sleep books years ago. Long story.) Anyway, this has done the trick!  It lights up the ceiling and walls in her cozy room, as one other reviewer indicated. I even find myself wanting one-it's so very zen.  The only thing missing is an ipod input and speakers for the Guided Meditations track (see this in the CD section!) It is beautiful and soothing. The ladybug is just as beautiful.  My go-to gift for baby showers and birthday presents now.  You can't go wrong with any of them!Caveat-they DO turn off after 45 minutes, so you may need to reset, or know that they function as more of a ""helping to sleep"" light, rather than an ""all-night"" nightlight. Enjoy!",5

Fisher-Price Deluxe Jumperoo,"Our son really loves his jumperoo - he was 4 1/2 mo when we got it for him.he wants to try to stand all the time now and this gives him the opportunity and gives mom a break!the only reason i gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is the size - it's huge and cannot be folded up or put away easily - but i knew that from the other reviews.  i have read that the exersaucers etc. that """"help them stand"""" should really only be used 1/2 hour at a time and only 2 x a day - babies that don't use them walk and crawl sooner according to this.  anyway - he usually gets tired of it around  30 min. anyway. but while he's in it he jumps like crazy and is now """"walking"""" one foot at a time.  it's nice that there aren't as many toys as on the exersaucer - sometimes it's a sensory overload.  all in all i think this is a great toy and adjustable too!",4
"Ju-Ju-Be Be All Diaper Bag, Lotus Lullaby","I've been on the hunt for the perfect diaper bag.  This is my fourth one, and, so far, the best.  There are so many great features, but a couple that I really appreciate are all the pockets and compartments to help me stay organized, and I love the fact that it's machine washable.  I recently purchased a Petunia Pickle Bottom diaper bag and was extremely disappointed.  Unlike the Ju Ju Be All bag, the PPB bag was not machine washable, did not hold it's shape, and the velcro was HORRIBLE (too loud, snagged my clothes, and, was overall, just a pain to deal with)!  I love the magnetic closures of the Ju Ju Be All bag.I originally saw the Ju Ju bag at Nordstrom, but later discovered it on Amazon and noticed that it was a bit cheaper than the dept. store and also offered free shipping.  When I placed my order, I was informed that I would receive my bag in about 14 days.  It was at my door in 48 hours!  Love the free shipping and super fast delivery.  I would definitely recommend the Ju Ju Be All bag, as well as Little Dudes and Divas retailer.",5

"Summer Infant SwaddlePod 2-Pack, Hungry Caterpillar, Newborn","My son loves to sleep in these and they are super convenient for night time diaper changes. However, after only about 2 weeks of using these (maybe 7-10 times each) both zippers broke and we had to throw them out. We ordered two packs and the other two are still working just fine. I'm not sure if we just got a bad pack but these two are already in the trash. We are very disappointed that they didn't last very long at all. The baby's size isn't to blame either because the other two still fit and work perfectly.",2
"KF Baby Diaper Bag Insert Organizer - 12 x 6.4 x 8 inch, Black","For the price this thing is great - which is why I bought it. If I had more money to spend on this kind of thing I would've gotten a better product from Etsy. At any rate, it does what it's supposed to do but it does have major downsides: The fabric feels cheap, sort of like really sturdy paper towels if that makes sense, but hey, there's a reason this thing is less than $20. And yes, it STINKS. I Febreezed it about six times because I'm wary of the thing falling apart in the wash. It seems sturdy enough, but not necessarily sturdy enough to hold up in the washing machine.",3

"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Easy Bath Kneeler, Blue","Our son is now 3 months old and before we got this mat we were using a towel (folded up) under our knees when giving him a bath.  This worked OK but bath time was still a chore because we were still so uncomfortable on our knees. We just tried to hurry and finish his bath instead of letting him enjoy the water and play.  We got this mat for Christmas and LOVE it.  Bath time is now fun for all three of us.  It has so much padding for the knees and also for the arms/ elbows on the edge of the tub.  The suction cups allow it to stay in place while in use and it folds up for easy storage.  We have yet to use the pockets on it but I'm sure they will be useful as time goes on and more bath products are needed.  I would HIGHLY recommend this mat to any parents, grandparents or anyone who has to bathe a child or a pet for that matter!",5
The First Years FoldDown Single Bedrail,"This rail is NOT easy to assemble; it is frustrating, as the directions are poor and the parts do not always fit together perfectly. On top of that, nothing on the box told me it would require assembly! The supporting rails extend underneath the entire width of the mattress, which makes it very cumbersome to install, remove, store, or transport. Once you get through the unclear instructions and actually get it put together, and then have someone help you install the awkwardly long supporting rails, it does function well. However, I decided to go back to my old-style rail.",3
Evenflo Top of Stair Gate,"This is the only gate I've seen that is approved for stairs. It is really good for this purpose. It is sometimes awkward to install to a railing. Make sure not to install it too low, it'll catch the floor and is difficult to open. If you install it too high, the little ones can squeeze under.",4
Infantino Wall Mounted Mobile - Lion,"My son started looking at this from the first week and he smiled at it long before he actively smiled at us! even when he is upset, we can take him to the changing table and tell him that 'Roary Lion' says hello and he will stop crying to look at him. My son has conversations with Roary too. The only drawback is you may have to modify the hanging part to work for your house set up. We attached ours to a swing out plant hanger :}",5
Safety 1st Tubside Bath Seat,"Much safer than the old blue seat or any seat with suction cups! When my daughter was a baby (she is 5 now) I used the 4-in-1 from the first years, it worked alright until it broke (over zellest dad) Then we tried the 4-in-1 from safety first, my daughter who was average size leaned forward to get a toy and fell in to the waterface first with her legs stuck under the ring. Then we tried the blue swivel seat, The whole thing flipped over with her in it and our tub was not textured, all she was doing was kicking her feet. Thank goodness I always held on to her. Now with my son (13 months also averadge size) We have been using this seat for a few months: He has never fallen in to the water and he is more active than she was. I still don't let go of hem for obvious reasons, but this seat is much safer!!",5
The Floppy Seat: Deluxe Shopping Cart Seat Cover with EZ Carry Storage Bag!,"I recently purchased an EZ Floppy Seat for my 7 1/2 month old son. It is the best thing I've purchased for my son so far. I quickly realized I needed something to protect him when he outgrew his nice little infant carrier. Couldn't even think about putting him in a yucky shopping cart or public high chair and holding this little chunk was defintely not going to work. Not only does the floppy seat provide a safety barrier from germs in shopping carts and restaurant high chairs, it provides cushioning for my baby. Everyone is happy!",5

"Carters Easy Fit Sateen Crib Fitted Sheet, Ecru","I purchased this sheet for a Baby Cache crib with a Colgate Classica mattress. Colgate mattresses have squared corners so sometimes it's hard to find sheets that fit. This sheet first perfectly!

Squatty Potty 7&quot; Toilet Stool-Elimination Aid - Natural Bathroom Relief Through A Toilet Stool,"I was having difficulty with bowel movements following intestinal surgery, and a Physical Therapist recommended I try a stool under my feet.  I tried thick books and boxes without much success but then I got a Squatty Potty and it made a huge difference by getting my feet higher off the ground and spread wider.The 7-inch works fine for my home toilets, and I bought a 9-inch for work as the commercial toilet is higher.  I'm 6-feet tall.  They fit nicely with the toilet shapes.Would buy over and over again.  Just wish they had a folding travel version.",5
Wipe Aide - The Toilet Paper Moistener,It works well for us!  I'm not sure how long it will last.  I would like to see them make one out of glass.Worth buying!,4
Sticky Bellies -Sticky Bellies Monthly Milestone Stickers - Oh Sew Ready : Maternity : 12-40 Weeks,These are cute but they don't stick very well. We use them to take our baby's pic and had to keep readjusting them.They're fun colors though so I decided to still keep them and use them.,3
"Sassy Cuddle Bug Bouncer, Whimsical Bumble Bee","This thing is adorable, but I wish they'd but a few more dollars into the frame. The frame is hollow bent tubing, and while they say that it can support a baby up to 25 lbs, I feel like you'll wind up with this thing bending slowly towards the ground if you're baby is heavier than a softball. Between the vibration and the low weight allowance to start with, I worry that this could rattle apart, especially if your baby is a big squirmer.That said, this is super cute. I love how the butterfly wings double as a wrap. Despite the picture of what is clearly at least a 6 month old, this is intended more for newborns, as the height allowance won't get you much past that. The toys are on velcor rather than hooks, so your baby could pull one down with enough effort, which I actually like. The overall design is colorful, and it does only take about 5 minutes to put together. The battery case is annoying, as it is screwed shut, which is totally unnecessary and requires additional tools.Overall, a really cute option, and better designed that others I've seen, but for $45, its insufficient for what it can deliver.",2

Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,Got this monitor when we had our baby 3 months ago. It works well. The video quality is just like what other users say and the we've never had a reception issue yet. It lacks a few features that more expensive models have but this is good enough for us.,5
Boppy Luxe - Clouds,"The Boppy Pillow was one of the best things I received from my registry.  It really helped my husband when feeding our son, where he could get him positioned just right.  Also, when it was time to learn to sit up, it was a great tool.  Cover was easy to wash!  Definitely worth the money!!",5

Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,"For our 2nd child, we wanted to get a firmer mattress than we used for our 1st.  in hindsight, that 1st mattress was way too soft.  This is the best mattress we could have gotten for the money. Perfectly firm but not hard!  Our 8M old now sleeps very comfortably on this mattress.  She was in a cradle for the 1st 5mos.  Now she has plenty of room to roll around and sleep on her stomach without me panicking that the mattress is too soft.  The price for this mattress is fantastic... even if you used a 20% coupon @ Babies R Us, you would still probably pay more.  I would recommend this product to anyone for infants.",5
Kidkusion Gummi Crib Rail,"First I want to say - buy this or something BEFORE your baby starts to gnaw on the crib. By the time that happens, the idea of doing a little research and ordering something online goes out the window. What are you doing baby! That's your awesome crib we bought and lovingly put together for you!I can be a bit of a perfectionist, so I took all the time to read the directions, apply the alcohol, wait for it to dry, etc. Even trying to be as careful as could be, I had a lot of trouble getting these to go on the crib straight. Not a big deal for some. For others, it may totally ruin the whole appearance of the crib to have a crooked, wavy crib rail. It would have been easier to keep straight if I started in the middle and pushed the sides down evenly, but I wanted to leave a little bubble of air under the top to provide some extra cushion.One last tip - it can take a couple of days for the adhesive to really set, so again, don't wait until your baby is already chewing things up, or this thing will probably just get pulled off. Once the adhesive has really set, you may be more worried about pulling paint off the crib when (if) it comes time to take this off.",4
"Graco SnugRide Classic Connect 30/35 Infant Car Seat Base, Tan",Just like the one that came with the car seat. I've had this for about a month and love no more car swapping with the base!,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"We got this when our daughter was 3.5 months old -- she's active and loves to jump & thump in her bouncy seat but was frustrated with reclining & kept trying to sit up. We thought she'd enjoy being upright and actually able to jump in this. She's tiny so we had to add a pillow underneath at first but just 6 weeks later and she's heavier and long enough to reach with a folded up yoga mat underneath. She LOVES this thing! The toys, the sounds, everything about it makes her really happy. It's been fun watching her figure out all the different gadgets too.Bonus: assembly was one of the easiest and fastest of all her toys!!",5
Harlow 4 Piece Crib Bedding Set,"I had been trying to find this set at a local store so I could see it in person. Unfortunately I couldn't but I loved the color and design. If it arrived and was 75% of what it looked like in the photo I would be satisfied. It was even better though!The black trim on the blanket is actually black velvet. The beautiful damask pattern is embroidered and sewn on and is not a flat pattern on the fabric. The bumper is half a cream with green & black outlined flower and the other part of the bumper is black and cream striped.The main photo hides the actual dust ruffle which is GORGEOUS. Cream with a black damask thick trim and green velvet trim where it meets the mattress.The boudoir accent pillow is black velvet embroidered with the green and cream leaves and green velvet trim. The color is spot on. It is an avocado/retro green.The sherpa blanket is satin on one side with the common super soft cream fuzzy chenille on the other side.The sheet is the same green with a small darker shade of green dot pattern on it. It is such a great mix of colors and textures I would highly recommend this set for a girls' room with a twist.The fabrics are all durable and thick, it is well made.I love, love, LOVE this bedding!",5

Sorelle Vista Adult Rails and Slats - France White,I have no complaints! The bed rail was very easy to install and color matches perfectly with the previously purchased crib. LOVE that this crib was so easily converted to a big girl bed!,5
"Beansprout Bella Mobile, Cream",The music plays too fast so it gets done in just a minute or so. Can't really walk away before you have to go back and wind it up again. Music is not really soothing playing that fast either. Only good thing is it matches my bedding :(,3
"Munchkin Arm and Hammer Nursery Fresheners, 5 Pack, Lavender or Citrus","This product doesn't cost much. They seem to work well, but I have added two or more to each closet. I'm using them in trash cans, hampers, etc. I have purchased them 2x and probably will buy more.",4
Tiddliwinks Blue Transportation Flecked Blanket,I searched the internet for another Tiddliwinks sage blanket as I am not sure they make this one anymore.  It is soooo soft and one of my twin daughters has become so attached to hers that I thought I better get a second just in case-she would go into shock if we lost it.  It washes well too.  It is my daughter's best friend.  I hope they make it again because it is a soft pretty blanket that I would recommend for a baby gift.,5
WubbaNub Brown Puppy,Okay this is just about the coolest product ever.  My son loves to take it everywhere.  He loves holding it almost as much as the pacifier.  Plus it makes people laugh to see him holding it.,5
"Mam Monsters Silicone Pacifier, Unisex, 6 Plus months, 2 count",These work great for our son though he doesn't seem super picky about binkies.  I also like the little leash you can get for Mam pacifiers though I wish the plastic clip was smaller.,5
Phil &amp; Ted's Me Too! Hook on High Chair Color: Red,"We have 17 month old triplets and traditional highchairs consumed too much space. We have a solid wood island in our kitchen and these seats attach securely and with ease. They also work well at most restaurants at booths or tables. If you have a more formal table with trim around the under edge of the table, you may not be able to attach these chairs. Assuming your table can support the weight and doesn't have trim, these are a great value and save space. Now all of us can sit around our island for meals.",4
BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector,The Guardian Car Seat Protector offers great coverage. Now we do not have to put a towel under the car seat.,5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","We've liked this car seat for a couple years now - we have two of them.  The controversial buckle hasn't been a problem for us yet.  I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because 1.) the buckle problem we may have in the future and 2.) because the black and grey model isn't as soft as the the others.  I wish I knew the name of the fabric, but it's a little rough and more susceptible to velcro and other snags.  Take a look at the close up photo of the black/grey booster seat to get an idea of what I mean.",4
"5 Piece Dark Gray Suit with Shirt, Vest, and Tie - Size 10","It is a really nice suit for the price.  It also holds up really well, so I don't worry about handing it down to my 3 younger sons, too.  I would absolutely buy it again!",5
"Diono See Me Too, Black","I have spent almost four years looking for a mirror that will work with my OnStar rear view mirror and had gone through about five of them. This one finally works! I can see my toddlers in the back seat! It fits tightly too and doesn't wobble at all. My only complaint is that the mirror is a bit small for my Tahoe so I can only see one child at a time. Plus, the 360 joint gets a bit lose when it is hot.",4
Baby Merlin's Magic Sleepsuit 3-6 months - Blue Small,The first night we used this was the first night out of her rock 'n sleeper.  She slept 7 hours.  There was no transition from our room to hers.  She never seemed to notice!,5
"Baby Banana Bendable Training Toothbrush, Infant","My son, who is 10 months old, immediately knows how to use it. He never likes/cares any of teething toys, I bought about 10 different shape teething toys, I bought for him.Therefore, I was a little bit worry that he will not like this training toothbrush. After read all the reviews, I decided to give it a shot. He just loves it at the very 1st time I gave to him. The brush is soft enough for his baby gum and the handles were so easy for him to grape and bend.Actually, I am thinking to get another one just in case we lose this one.I will defiantly recommend this product to all my friends.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Waterfall Peek-a-Boo Soother,"My son loves this product. We bought this when he was 3 months old. We were looking for something to add to the Soundspa Lullaby we already owned (love that one too but the images on the ceiling were too far away for him at the time). He immediately loved it and it is great to play as he falls asleep. It is as described and has a soft setting and a louder setting. He still hasn't figured out how to turn it on himself but can usually do it by accident if he is kicking around.The only complaint I have is that when it is on the setting for motion, music and lights it only lasts like 5-6 min then it  turns off, and it drains the battery. Since he has not figured out how to turn it on himself yet it creates a hassle for us to have to go in and turn it back on if he hasn't fallen asleep yet. Overall I really like it, just wish that it would last longer when on the setting for motion, music and lights.We have been using a combination of the Rainforest Waterfall and the Soundspa Lullaby. this way when the Rainforest shuts off the soundspa lullaby will continue all night.",4
Fisher-Price Waddle Clacker,My son isn't too big on toys but he laughs at this one so I guess he likes it. :),4
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Bought the booster seat for a 5 month old who sits with assistance/support. I had three main considerations:1) I did not want to invest in buying a fancy high chair that has an option for infants to use it for just a couple of months but was concerned the baby will not be comfortable in this one.2) I looked for a chair that occupies minimal space by either folding or fitting under the dinning table3) I wanted something that is easy to keep clean.This booster is great in all of these three aspects and at times even exceeded my expectations:1) The baby is stable. We did put a folded blanket at the side of the chair to make the fit better. And I love the fact that this chair will continue to be used up until she sits at the table on a regular chair. Great investment! She likes the chair and gets tiered of sitting only near the end of the feeding session.2) The use of the two straps (one around the seat and one around the back of the chair) make it stable on the chair. It is low enough to be able to move the chair with the booster under the dinning table. So it takes minimal space and allows the baby to sit at the dinner table with the family, which makes feeding so much more fun.3) Cleaning-wise it is just wonderful -- easy to wipe off plastic that can be taken apart and thrown into the dishwasher.The only downside: You cannot put the baby in when the table compartment is attached to the chair. So you have to remove it and put it back in once the baby sits there. Its is not hard to do, but it is an annoying extra step to take, sometimes with a hungry or a fussy baby. Plus, I thought the whole point of a removable try is that you dont have to take off the whole table compartment for cleaning -- only the insert. But in reality you need to take them both anyways, so what's the point?!",4
BRICA Deluxe High Chair Cover,"Well designed with the toy straps, Fits most restaurant chairs and folds up very nicely. It's great to have this with us when we go out to eat. It's much easier than cleaning the chair every time.",5

"aden + anais Classic Muslin Swaddle Blanket 2 Pack, For The Birds","We received the camo design swaddles for our daughter when she was a few months old - just as summer was hitting. She's now two, and we've used them year round: that first summer, she they were the perfect swaddle - light, breathable, and wrappable even as she grew. By winter she no longer needed swaddling, but these swaddles morphed into the perfect soft sheet to create an additional layer beneath her blanket. So we've been using them about 1.5 years, and one of them finally developed a weak spot and tore (about a three inch hole). The second also shows signs of an approaching farewell. I'm sorry they didn't last longer, but considering the wear we put on them (almost continual use!), the've actually done splendidly. We're expecting another baby this summer, and this is the only swaddle I've put on my gift registry (or rather, the only brand and make - I've put a number of designs on!). Well worth the cost for comfort, durability, and plain snuggliness.",5

Baby Einstein Play &amp; Go Toy Arch,"The toys are cute and our baby enjoys them, but that is about all this thing has going for it.  I can't get this thing to clip onto anything securely.  It didn't work on the bouncer, carseat, stroller, high chair - you name it, this thing doesn't work with it.  The main reason is that the clips are poorly designed and either don't tighten enough or don't open up enough to be useful.  The other issue is that even if the clips are secured, the entire arch can be adjusted towards or away from the baby.  This is a cool idea, except when the baby grabs a toy and swings the entire arch around and slams it into his/her face.  It actually takes more force to activate the musical lion than it does to move the entire arch.",2
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I waited to review this until I saw how it performed in the really-stinky-diaper stage.  Now, with my daughter at 1 year and eating lots of solids (and making really stinky diapers), I can happily recommend the diaper champ.  A couple suggestions: 1) as baby's poop gets stinkier, empty more often (at least once a week) and 2) every time you empty, spray with Lysol or similar product and wipe out with antibacterial cleaner.  This second step has kept the plastic from retaining a bad smell.I gave 4 stars because it's not ""perfect"" -- sometimes a little smell leaks out if it's very full.  But all around a good product, and not needing special refill bags is a huge benefit for a busy mom.",4
The Miami Neatnik Saucer High Chair Cover &amp; Placemat,"I agree with the previous reviewer.  It's a good idea that just doesn't work.  It's too large, I'm too far away from him and can't feed him...  well you know what that was when my son was 8 mos old.  I guess I could try it now that he's 15 mos.  If I do, I'll update review.",1

Baby Food Containers- Sprout Cups - Reusable Stackable Storage Cups (12 Pack) with Tray and Dry-erase Marker - 100% BPA Free (2 Oz),"We've used these jars for about 4 months now, and they've generally worked well.  Washing only in warm water and soap, the white labels are mostly intact though have begun to wear off.  The lids seal very well and have never leaked for us.  When packing them the fact they they click together is a nice feature.On the other hand: They don't really snap into the base very well, so we've ended up not using it. We just stack them upside down in a little tower with the lids separate.  Also, we use the OXO cube tray to freeze our baby food, and you can't even really fit one cube in these cups without thawing.  Each jar can fit 2-3 cubes worth of puree, but you have to thaw them first.  For this purpose, we've actually had much better luck just using 4oz canning jars.  We use the dry erase pen that came with these to label the lids.  They are easier to feed out of too.  So while there's nothing terrible about these cups, I would choose the glass canning jars (bonus: they can go in the dishwasher!). My husband has chimed in that these are a pain to wash.",3

Meeno Baby Cool Me Seat Liner Stroller - Baby Blue,This works perfectly in our stroller but is too big for a car seat so make sure you buy the car seat version if that's what you are looking for. Our son runs hot all the time so this helps keep him a little cooler in the stroller...I would also recommend a clip on fan.,4
"Boon Switch Containers, 6.5 Ounce","When my kid started eating snacks and taking food to school at almost a year old, i bought a whole bunch of cute containers for transporting the food, including Itsy Ritzy bags, Lunchskins, and these.  All work well for the right situation, but these are the most versatile and are the only ones where the Cheerios don't get stale and the bagel doesn't get yucky.  They are a great size for going out for a few hours, they fit in every kind of bag or purse, and they look good. Plus, i've found a huge added bonus: since they stay closed and are made of durable plastic, if you fill them with puffs they become a shake toy for your child when you're on the go!",5
Summer Rest Assured Sleeper,"Honestly I usually get the opposite so I was a bit shocked when I had this happen.We went to BRU to look for a cosleeper and found this one.  I almost always shop the economy and then go home and use my Amazon Prime. I told my DH that we can get it from Amazon cheaper.  We got home, I logge din and was shocked to see that on Amazon it is listed at almost twice the amount.  It was NOT on sale at BRU.  Sadly I have to go back to BRU and get it rather than order from Amazon ((which I LOVE doing)).",5

The sape of this brush is a winner, cleaning better in most difficult bottles where a hand nor sponge go easilyPros- Winner shape- Very durable, will last you 10 times more time than other bottle cleaners- Doesn't build mold easily.- Brush not soft, but not hard, so great. Brush be hardly pressured during the cleaning and will return to its original shape then.- Stick is had enough to apply pressure.No considerable cons... give it a try, you will like it.",5
"Maxi-Cosi Rodi XR Booster Car Seat, Walnut Brown","OK... I have to say that it's truly bizarre that there are no reviews for this seat anywhere!I bought it based on the crash testing ratings(tops in the German list and their standards are high) and because it looks cool.My daughter loves it and says it's comfy. The seatbelt never touches her neck.  It's very solid feeling... easy to reach across to fasten the seat belt... The cup holder is pretty weird... you have to take it off if someone needs to sit next to her.I had a Graco Booster that my daughter folded like a rag doll in when she slept... so off I went to find a booster that reclines.We've had this a couple of months now... sleeping is great, she still flops forward if she falls asleep in a funny position but I am able to adjust her then her head will stay back the rest of the time.We got the Chili color and it's great! Hot pink, apricot and a dark plum... very stylish.  I'm going to get a second one soon to replace her Britax in our other car.You should go to their website and pick England as your country... they have a movie there that shows assembly etc.  The British seat is a little different, but the movie was helpful to me on putting it together and setting the recline position.",5
"Britax Parkway SG-2 Booster Car Seat, Pewter Dots","The car seat works fine, and I know that it is safe. I had no problems installing it. I love the clip.  My only complaint is the armrests.  The are so small. My sons elbows can't even reach them with his coat on.  They are too low and totally non-functional.  I feel so bad for him sitting back there with his arms folded on his lap with no where to rest them.  He just looks uncomfortable.  Kids already have to let their legs dangle and now his arms dangle.  I can't stand it.  He puts up with it because he is enchanted with the fact that he can now buckle himself in. His old carseat which he outgrew, had nice armrests.  Overall, I would choose this booster seat again I suppose, because as far as I know it is the only one with that middle between the legs clip. I just expected more from this company, like armrests for example.*I'd like to make an amendment to my previous review.  I realized once I removed the back from the booster seat, the armrests were much more convenient for him to use.  Perhaps he was just getting too big for the booster seat with a back.  Now, he uses it with just the bottom, and it is wonderful!",4
Infantino Swift Classic Carrier Black,"A little confusing at first with all the straps and buckles, but easy to get the hang of. Easier for my husband to wear comfortably versus my sling. Comfortable and stylish enough especially for the unbeatable price. Baby seems to enjoy it for the most part...happy with my purchase :)",4
Kidkusion Hearth Kushion Taupe,"We purchased this for our fire place to protect my baby, but she now just loves to take it on and off. I wish there was a better way to put it on tightly rather than just with double sided tape. I have to keep re-taping it..now it's just annoying.",3
Infantino Jumbo Shape Sorter,"E-Z ordering fast Xmas shopping on AZ, gave to granddaughter for xmas, too many toys at once, well made in the FP quality.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,You really can not appreciate this device until you've used it.No smell unless you don't empty it for a week or more. An airtight vault it's not....but it does what it's designed to do very well.Who doesn't take out the trash more than once a week ? Same concept with this diaper pail.- From a Dad of a Newborn who's thankful he ignored the negative reviews.,5
"Thirsties Wet Diaper Bag, Hoot","Perfect size for spending the day out of the house. I even put the clean diapers in one, and dirty diapers in another because the bags are so convenient.",5
"Contours Lite Stroller, Tangerine","I bought this stroller in anticipation of summer travel and quick trips.  It is a fabulous stroller.  Very easy to maneuver, great features, and seems comfortable for my son.  We have other high end strollers and this has all the great features, but is so much lighter.",5
Lamaze Turtle Tunes,"This product came early, was in perfect condition and was exactly what I expected. The music notes sound wonderful. My son loves this toy.",5
"Thermos FUNtainer Bottle, Disney Princess, 12 Ounce","I purchased this solely for my daughter to take to school. I was concerned that the water in her non-insulated bottle was warm and non-drinkable after sitting in a warm classroom or worse yet a hot playground! This Thermos has met my expectations and then some.It is an ABSOLUTE MUST that you pre-chill the bottle before adding your beverage. The easy way is to wash the bottle, keep the cap off and place it in your refrigerator for a couple of hours. I usually leave mine in overnight. Then fill with ice and water.I can relax a little knowing my daughter has ice cold water all day. I loved this so much I purchased another for my other daughter.Keep in mind that even though the images on the bottle are nice they are NOT meant to last. We do not have a dishwasher so everything gets washed by hand. After several months of use the images are starting to fade and get washed away. That is the only bad thing about this thermos.",5
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","We love this swing. It keeps my newborn busy for some time. This is the only place -aside from grandma's arms- that he takes a daytime nap. Everywhere else, he wakes up every 10 minutes. My only complaint is that you can't remove the head support. It makes my baby's head tilt down. I am always worried that he won't be able to breathe. I try to prop him up higher so this does not happen. If he were taller (he is 21 inches now), this would not be a problem. Otherwise, it would have been 10 stars.",4

The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"It has sturdy sides to keep mom and dad off of it but enough mesh to allow air flow. I definitely recommend this to keep your baby close while you sleep.  It folds up and is easy to transport for a nap away from home, too.",4
"Carter's First Year Calendar, Blossom",This will be a cute addition to the matching baby book where my daughter can log all of her baby's first year outings and appointments and trips that wouldn't necessarily go in the milestones of the baby book.  (My daughter bought me the matching Grandma's Brag Book for me to show off my granddaughter to my friends and colleagues at work!),5
Woombie Sleeper - Baby Love-0-4m,"We live in upstate NY and winters are little bit colder here than normal so I started to shop around for a sleepsack with roomy, cozy, warm and comfy specified in my mind. I did not think I will find one with everything I want in it but I did with this sleepsack. My baby boy started to use it at 3mos and even if the sleeves are a little long, the neckline did not go over his chin so we just folded the sleeves. After 5 washes, the fabric was still the same- no shrinkage. I recommended this sleepsack to my friends and relatives and also in our online community blog since we were all looking for a sleepsack with sleeves! (and preferably one with the sleeves you can fold in to act as a mitten too)I gotta say that I heard good things from my friends about this product as well... I will continue to recommend it!",5
Vulli Chan Pie Gnon Natural Rubber Teether - Blue Chan,This toy is great.  It is not made out of that hard plastic that babies have a hard time squeezing.  This toy is extremely easy to squeeze yet safe and durable.  My child likes to suck and chew on the antennae.  It squeaks just like any other squeak toy.  If you buy this toy wiggle side to side rapidly with short motion and the head wiggles and it makes a funny squeaking noise that makes kids laugh.  This is a cute and different toy and I recommend this to everyone.  Definitely worth the money.,5
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner for Highchairs, Blue","The suction cups are worthless and my 9m olds have been peeling them up for months. THe Embossed designs make it less easy to just quickly wipe clean. The one thing I do love is the the little catch scoop that fits between the highchair and the counter, but I don&#8217;t even bother with the placemat anymore, because the twins only occasionally drop things on accidents.",3
Flip Toilet Potty Seat - Blue,ZERO STARS. It does NOT fit a standard toilet seat unless you live in a house where no man (or boy) needs to use the toilet. The hinge is too narrow and the seat won't flip up. I wasted a Sunday trying to install this while my daughter eagerly waited for her big girl potty seat. Now she is crying and I missed 2 football games.,1

"7 A.M. Enfant Pookie Poncho Baby Bunting Bag, Metallic Charcoal",Bought to use with our city mini stroller. Unless you want it loose and flapping around don't get it. Go with the JJ Cole Toddler bundle me instead. This product is clearly meant for a particular stroller and the city mini isn't it.,1
"The First Years Straw Cup, Pink Take and Toss, 10 Ounce, 4-Count","Cups can be used with regular bendy straws...the hard ones that come with cups cant really be washed...used a pipecleaner for a bit, then gave up...doesnt matter, a straw is a straw...you just lose the spill proof factor. Kids take out straws anyway. Wish they made 16 oz cups...i would use them.",4
2-in-1 Car Seat Cover `n Carry,"This is a great item in THEORY.  It does not work as well as expected.  The wheels and base are too small.  And halfway threw my first trip with it the zipper broke and the canvas ripped.  Since this is pretty much the only game in town for traveling by yourself with a toddler except a backpack which I can not use (bad Back), I have bought the second one.  And if it breaks I will probably buy another because it does allow me to push the stroller with the baby in it and pull the car seat.",3
Evenflo Single Breast Pump,My Medela pump hasnt been delivered yet so for my sanity my husband ran out and got me this one for now to ease my mind. for that purpose it worked and i could see usen this for travel if you have privacy .. but not for your average out and around .. oops im leeking let me discreetly go empty a lil in the ladies room and pump and dump. it is WAAAY TO LOUD! My husband can hear me threw closed bedroom door.I am hoping the 300 doller pump is much quieter. It is also awkward. you cant put it down without the stand or it topples over. And the little blue over flow piece simply falls out and you can loose it easy in the middle of the night when ur half asleep.. or even awake and just not ontop of the lil thing.id say the sound of it is equal to an old school dust busters sound.,3
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,My wife and I purchased this monitor 3 years ago when our daughter was born.  We still use this monitor to this day!  But we are having another baby in January so we are in the market to purchase another baby monitor.  Well that is why I am here to purchase another one of these baby monitors.  We absolutely love this product!  Some of the lower star reviews that you may have read more than likely never read the instructions before sing this product.  We have used other baby monitors that were given to us when our daughter was born but none of them were as reliable as this particular product.  Please do not let the negative reviews sway you from this product.  Just be sure to read the instructions completely and this product will not fail you.,5

"Philips AVENT BPA Free Non Spill Soft Spouts, 6 Months","My twins love these.  We have the klean kanteen bpa-free (obviously, since they are stainless steel) sippy cups.  They didn't like the green spouts the cup came with (same shape, also Avent), they were way too hard.  Got these, and my guys are super happy.  Highly recommended for moving your baby off of bottles.",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,We have been using this monitor for a couple years.  It still works well but has been dropped too many times and the antenna broke off.  So I just bought another one for my wife for Christmas.  Highly recommend.,5
Safety 1st Oven Front Lock,"I bought this based on the mostly good reviews it received...and kept my fingers crossed.  I thought I was going to be disappointed because it fell off a few times in the first night...mostly because we were playing with it.  But, after given a little time to adhere, it hasn't fallen off since then.  We have heated our oven to more than 350 degrees and it still stuck nicely.  It is a tight fit with our oven handle, but there is room, so we can manage.The one thing I don't like is that when you lift it up to open the oven door, it doesn't stay up.  This means it gets in the way when you try to close the oven door again.  You have to grab it and hold it up, which can get a little toasty on the fingers.  But, I'd rather have toasty hands that burnt toddler fingers.I bought a 2nd one and planned on using it for my dishwasher, but found that my counter is not laminated on the underside.  The adhesive didn't stick to the wood.  I have some laminate material that I may try to stick on the underside of the counter to see if that does the trick.Overall, this has been a great purchase and I would highly recommend it.",4
"Britax Parkway SG-2 Booster Car Seat, Pewter Dots",Easy to install and my 5 yr old was proficient in buckling himself in a month! And I like the added security of the between the legs piece.,5
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,It got here before I thought it would and it was easy to install and it works Grate. I should have bought 2 but now the price is up.,5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Suppose this was made as a baby door.. so i should not compare it when using it with animals...However, for the sake of many of you who may be buying this as a pet gate..Do note that when it has been bitten or chewed on one too many times.. some parts start to rust..So please do take note of that when considering this.In terms of It doing the job as advertised and preventing the animals from coming out. Rest assured it does it!",3
Lovely Baby-nappy Fasteners (Pack of 3),"When I removed them from the package they smelled like mothballs.  I had to leave them out of the package to get rid of the smell, so then my son's room smelled of mothballs for a couple of days.I'm not very impressed with the fasteners.  Since they are attached separately and it is not all one piece, the fasteners detach when trying to get a diaper put together.  Makes it quite difficult while wrangling a baby and trying to attach a diaper.",3
Munchkin Dora the Explorer Bath Squirters,"My two-year old granddaughter came to visit from California. Bath time is always special, but even more so when there are toys to add to the fun. She loved these. I ordered another set and had them sent to her.",5
Foogo by Thermos Leak-Proof SS 12 oz Straw Bottle in Blue,"I like that liquid stays cold all day and it doesn't leak in the vertical position like our other straw cups that allow liquid to warm and expand without venting.  However, it still leaks if turned upside down.  Also, watch your toes when baby drops it, and our 15 month old has pinched her fingers several times in hinge to the the flip open cover (no injury sustained).  I can't find a replacement part for the silicone straw that our 3-year old bit off.",4
Bright Starts Having A Ball Drop N Slide FUNCastle,"We got the pink unicorn version of this castle as a first birthday gift, and it's a wonderful toy. I didn't know if either of us would like it at first, but it's very fun. My little one likes figuring out where the balls are going and finding the secret trap doors and dropping others down the ramp. I like that the balls are compatible with our other Bright Starts toys too. The music is pleasant.",5
"Baby Month Onesie Stickers Baby Shower Gift BOY DANCE DOTS Photo Shower Stickers, baby shower gift by OnesieStickers","I bought these to use for my first baby and it worked well! I wish i would have done it for our second child! Well worth the money! Although you could probably make your own, these were great!",5
"Dreambaby Stroller Fan, White/Blue","Nice product. Serves the purpose. Only disadvantage was, I used it while air travel at airport. Carried it in cabin baggage. So had to remove the battery and while using it in transit airport had to put it back again. The screw at the back was star screw so it became difficult. Could have been designed to have a Flathead screw that can be fixed with even a coin",4
"NUK Active Silicone Spout Learning Cup, Ladybug, 10-Ounce","This product worked really great for us - we already had a dozen or so NUK bottles, so the sippy-spout worked with both this bottle (that it comes with) and the other bottles and collars that we already had.The spout was a great transition from bottle to sippy cup - our son wanted nothing to do with sippy cups but used this spout for about 3 weeks and then EASILY made the leap to the full sippy cup, well before his 1st birthday. Great product.",5
Levana Sophia 2.4&quot; Digital Video Baby Monitor,"This is my first Video Baby Monitor. Back when I had my kids the Audio Monitors were the only reasonably priced option so it's nice to have this available for use with my Grand-kids.  The instructions for set up were easy enough and truthfully that was the part that I was worried about most.  Once I had it set up and on, I tested out the sound and video quality both in the light and dark.  I was pleased with the sound as it picked up even small noises and surprisingly the clarity of picture was excellent in the light and dark. Additionally the peep mode, night light and temperature sensor are all nice additions, even if the temperature isn't always accurate. My only complaint is that the screen is so small and to get a good view of the baby, you need to place the camera somewhat close to the crib.  Overall I think that this is a great budget friendly video monitor.",4
"Graco Pack 'N Play Playard with Reversible Napper and Changer, Roman","This is a great Pack 'N Play.  We have yet to test it out since our baby isnt' due for another few weeks but I have put it together and everything seems to be very functional and very sturdy.  I must say everything was easy to put togehter and figure out but the most frustrating part to assemble was the Napper/Changer.  It took a little bit to figure out how to manuver the metal bars to get them to click together.  Once I got it figured out the rest came easy.The next was the disassemble.  It seems as if the the Napper/Changer does not fully disassemble.  You can take the bars apart but you can't take the plastic end pieces off.  I tried everything and I came to the conclusion that if these were ment to come off that Graco would have not required tools to get it off.  Because of this when you pack up everything in the carring case the pieces to the Napper/Changer do not fit.  It's only two pieces and to me it isn't a big deal.  Just means I have to carry a bag in one hand and two pieces in the other.  Everything else, including the Napper/Changer padding, fits in the carry bag.I would have to say that once you get used to setting this up and taking it down that you should be able to be done in about 5-10 minutes depending on if you put the bassenet and Napper/Changer together.The wheels on the one side of the playard make is very easy to move incase it's in the way.The Napper/Changer is AWESOME!  It is the perfect depth for a baby to lay in and be cuddled up just right yet still leave enough room to put some extra padding such as blanket.  It is very sturdy.  I would have no issue and wouldn't worry one bit with him sleeping in it.The only true issue I would recommend to Graco is to try to design a specific way to pack the playard in the carrier.  This way you can than either design pockets or include small bags for pieces such as the bars for the bassenet, the mobile, and the Napper/Changer.  I would also recommend including in the instructions a recommended way of packing up the playard.  I had to figure this out on my own with all the extra pieces for the basenet and the Napper/Changer.",5

"Aquatopia Deluxe Safety Bath Thermometer Alarm, Green","I was excited to get this. It works well for my daughter who is old enough to just start learning to take baths herself as well as for my newborn son. I know my daughter can check the water temperature to get her bath just right before getting in. I also have peace of mind bathing my little baby. When my daughter was little we had a rubber ducky that changed color if the water was too hot, but it was slow to work and also didn't alert you if the water was too cold. I love that this one makes a beeping noise to let you know if the water isn't within a safe and comfortable range.My daughter was playing with it and the turtle snapped off the yellow part and I can't seem to get them snapped back together but they can be put together and still work great they just separate easily.The temperature does seem to be accurate but I haven't tested it with another thermometer but we have been using it for weeks with success.",5
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Papillon,I love this cover!  The colors and pattern are just beautiful and I get tons of compliments on it.  The rigid part at the top is just right for looking down at my daughter without exposing anything and the rest of the cover is wide enough to maneuver her on and off without exposure.  She seems content and comfortable though I haven't used it in particularly hot weather.  The terry part sewn into the undersides of the bottom corners are great for clean ups and keep me from having to hunt for a burp cloth.  I also use this for pumping while in the car and I can get all the parts into place without flashing anyone.,5

"Mommys Helper Safe-Er-Grip Drip Dry Portable Drying Rack, White","Loved the idea of this drying rack to hang wet bibs from in the kitchen.  However, we tried it on wood, granite and wall and it wouldn't stick to any of the surfaces for longer than 15 minutes.  We are returning it for our money back.",1
"Thermos FUNtainer Bottle, Disney Princess, 12 Ounce","Bought one for my daughter to start drinking water from straw. The material and finishing are very good. Although the latch button is a bit tight initially but after a few weeks, my daughter is able to open the lids by herself now.",5

"BABYBJORN Travel Crib Light , Blue",Amazing! We spend alot of time at our friends homes and ever since we bought this portable crib/playpen sleeping isn't a problem ANYWHERE! It takes maybe 20 seconds to put up and even less to set up. We use it as a play pen at home and because of its design it is perfect for my six month old to sit and watch the dogs pass by and I don't worry about him falling over becuase there are no hard surfaces inside the crib. This has already paid for itself and we recommend this to everyone.,5
"Sesame Street Potty Soft Seat, Elmo",The Dora potty seat goes with us everywhere when we go out. My daughter has recently potty trained but isn't ready to use the toilet yet so this seat is perfect. She also loves the pretty design :),5
Infantino Colors and Shapes Puzzle,"My 2 yr old twins love puzzles (just turned 2), they're pretty quick at most peg puzzles so we bought them this set and also a few Melissa and Doug jigsaw type w/10-12 pieces.  I think these are a better transition to regular puzzles because the pieces are easier for a toddler to put together and it focuses on a bunch of smaller pictures before moving onto a larger one.  I'm sure they will love the M&D; jigsaw later, but the Infantino puzzles are a great stepping stone.  I just ordered ""Where's my tail"" from Infantino.  Can't wait to receive it....Oh and an added bonus to the Infantino puzzles, they come in a nice easy to put away bucket....how cool!  My toddlers LOVE taking things in and out of buckets...so cleanup is another game!",5
Sevi B My Prince Cross Mobile Toy,"i love, love, love sevi products.  for both of my kids first christmases they received sevi music boxes and i bought this mobile for my daughter who is much more content to lie in her co-sleeper and stare up at things than my son ever was.  you have to give it a little push, but it will move slowly on it's on.  my only complaint is that the wood holder that would have went so nicely with it was poorly recommended, so i purchased the suggested plastic one which honestly isn't great either AND it's plastic. i'm constant adjusting it. :/  maybe do a bit more looking for a better holder.  but the quality of the mobile is fantastic, i love the story of the girl chasing her prince. :)",4
Teething Bling Pendant - Donut Shape (Bronze),"I love these necklaces. My baby always has a safe toy to chew on, and I don't have to worry about pieces breaking off or leaving it anywhere. She lights up when she sees it on my neck and loves to play with it when we go out somewhere and I'm holding her. No complaints at all.",5
"Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix","I have to say that I do love this car seat with one huge exception, important enough for a 1 star rating. I have a 2004 Honda Pilot and this seat does not install tightly due to the way the seat belt anchors are made. I struggled for weeks, read instrucions, wathced videos, talked to experts online, and then took it to the local car seat inspectors office. Two of their car seat safety inspectors/installers could not get it in easily. Once it was in tightly, I felt like I could never get it out again for risk of not being able to reinstall it well. Just beware if you have this type of vehicle. The car seat otherwise has great features and fits my 6 yr old (36 lbs/45in) very comfortably.",1
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I purchased this stroller for my babysitter as she is taking care of two other children aside from my baby. It is very helpful for her to take my baby and the three year old in the stroller while they walk the six year old to school. The material is great and the orange color is awesome. Although it can be a little heavy, it's well built. It is a great product!",5
Bink Link Pacifier Attacher - Candy Necklace,"These clips are very cute, I have two of them. I have to be honest that the clips do not hold onto fabric, and they are strange, you arent sure where to put the fabric in the first place because there are two places that it opens, and neither of them are entirely suitable. The peas and carrots I have works ok, but only opens wide enough in one place, the other one (this one) opens so wide in both places it wont hold a thing at all. I was sad I spent the money on this.",2
Baby Kid Safe Shower Bath Wash Hair Sunshade Shield Cap Shampoo Visor (pink),"When I received it, it was folded and stuffed into a small envelope from China. When I took it out it was completely misshapen and took a while for it to resemble the picture. It was also not as sturdy as it looked in the picture. I thought that the  rubbery foam material would have been thicker. Due to its thinness, it doesn't keep the water or shampoo out of my daughter's face. My advise is to save your money on this product and go for something more sturdy even if it mean spending more money!",1
Dr. Brown's 2 Pack Natural Flow Level 2 Wide Neck Nipple,we like this product. this is the only nipple that we found that our baby will latch on to. Thank you,4
Yookidoo Crawl N' Go Snail,"My 10 month old son loves this snail! But I'm pretty upset because I thought this snail would come with 2 shells as shown in multiple pictures. Mine only came with the stackable shell. I was already hesitant to pay $30, but to find that it comes with only 1 shell, I feel totally ripped off.When I called the company to ask where the other shell is, they said that they can't do anything because all their merchandise is handled by Amazon so I should contact them. I contacted Amazon and they said the description doesn't mention 2 shells (only 1) so there's nothing they can do about that. I said there are 2 pictures showing the other shell, and they told me in a very condescending tone, ""We undertand that ma'am but it is not our fault you didn't read the description."" They should remove the pictures if that's not what they're selling.My son loves the toy, so I'll keep it. But for what it is, it is not worth $30 + shipping, even with the extra shell!",3
Munchkin Mozart Magic Cube,"My son has played with this toy nonstop.  He is now 16 months old and it is one of the first things he reaches for when he wakes up.  When we travel I have make sure its packed.  Some kids have blankets, mine has the music cube.",5
Medela Breastmilk Storage and Feeding Set,i use this to store breastmilk so my husband can feed the baby.  i also use the bottles to freeze breastmilk.  its great because its compatible for the medela pump but my baby isnt that fond of the nipples.  i end up using the avent for feeding and transfer the milk from the medela.  buy this if you are planning on storing a lot of milk.  otherwise you are better off with avent or gerber new traditions.,4
"Pampers Natural Stages Airwave Venting System, Stage 4, Twin Pack, Pink/Blue, 7 Ounces","I second the other reviewer who said her baby bit the spout off.  Mine have used their teeth to gnaw the opening open even further, so now, milk or juice just pours out of it, which renders them pretty useless.  If I don't thoroughly check the remaining cups I have, I will either have milk or juice all over the place  If I don't keep on top of this, my babies are caught off guard by the milk pouring out of the gaping hole they made at the end of the spout.  I've tried looking for replacements because the condition of the actual cup is great, but I cannot find replacement spouts (interesting).  So, I've pretty much tossed all of the bad spouts, and replaced the entire sippy cup collection with a different kind of cup & spout design (holes vs. a slash in some silicone).  Bad idea Pampers!!!",2
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"My daughter has had this giraffe since she was about 4 months and has loved it since day one.  She is currently 8 months and still loves to suck on it, chew on it, squeak it, or just ""pet"" it.  Great toy, and totally worth the price.",5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow","This rock and play is a life saver!  I have newborn twins and one of them gets fussy and doesn't sleep well.  I ordered this with him in mind, after reading all the good reviews, and I am SO glad I did!  I am thinking of ordering one more and doing away with the pack and play!",5
Potty Tme Training Pants / Baby Swim Time Diaper Baby Blues Size 1,"The denim print looks better in the pic than in person, but the diaper holds up well. It fits nicely, but runs a little small. My son's 30th%ile and 15 months and he's already the on the largest setting. The stretchy material is really nice. It's not very absorbent, but the inner material is soft and you can stuff the pocket if you need to for more. The company shipped 2 days earlier than estimated as well. 5 stars.I ordered antonio bandana print as well and they sent me dump trucks. I didn't think it was worth sending back, but the dump truck fold over elastic is very poor quality compared to the baby blues. We've only used the diaper a few times and it looks in poor condition already. It looks ratty and pilly and old already. 1 star.",3
"Summer Infant Slumber Buddies, Frog","I love it and so does my 2 yr old daughter. She learned how to press all the buttons herself and loves to turn it on and change the colors and the songs. But none of that matters if it doesn't work. I'm on my 3rd one! Everytime it starts out working fine for a week or two and then it will go through new batteries everyday. Very dissapointing for me and more importantly, for my daughter",1
Summer Infant baby monitor battery,We bought this to replace the battery in the Summer Infant Video Monitor we received as a gift in 2008 to use for our second child.  It was compatible with our monitor and works great.,5
Dr. Brown's Bottle Warmer,This warmer is awesome.  I use it every single time I make her bottle to make sure it's at a good temperature.  It doesn't take long at all.  I just have to keep refilling the side pocket that needs water about every two or three days.  I recommend this!,5
"Lamaze Early Development Toy, Captain Calamari","I recommended this for my best friend's five-month-old baby.  She was excited from the moment that she saw it and the excitement hasn't worn off, even months later.  As a matter fact, she has become rather upset when she is separated from it.  An absolute must-have!",5
"Angel Dear Blankie, Green Frog","Super cute and soft and snuggly!  I thought long and hard about which lovey to buy for my daughter.  Love that this one is not traditionally &#34;pink&#34; or pastel.  The colors don't look out of place anywhere we go.  The little dog has &#34;sleeping&#34; eyes, so hopefully she will associate it with sleeping when she's older.  I wanted &#34;ears&#34; for nibbling or chewing, in case she ends up liking to do that.  Overall, a wonderful lovey I hope DD will love!",5
Preggie Pop Drops (21 Pieces) - Assortment of Sour Flavors ( Multi-Pack),was the only thing that would help with my morning/day sickness. wouldn't cure it completely but sure did take the edge off and helped a lot. wouldn't do another pregnancy with out them!,5
"BooginHead SippiGrip, Pink/Green/White",I actually bought two of these for myself and two more for a couple friends of mine.  I consider these a MUST for anyone with a sippy drinking child.  I always have them in my diaper bag for use at restaurants and find them useful on the go as well.  They are made well and I expect them to last until the sippys are gone a couple years from now.  AWESOME PRODUCT!!! Love these!,5
"Safety 1st Sound 'n Lights Activity Walker, Lil' Safari",First it doesn't go low enough and second wished the seat came of so it would be easier to clean.,4
Traveling Toddler Car Seat Travel Accessory,It's great for traveling solo. It is awesome in planes with aisles large enough to fit both luggage and carseat.,5
Hudson Baby Elephant Applique Fleece Blanket,"I bought these blankets for my two Yorkies, they love to snuggle in soft blankets and these do the trick. They are a tad bit thin, you'd probably have to double up if your intention is to keep a baby warm. Bt I liked the price and for what I needed,it got the job done...I have two happy Yorkies",4
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,This pillow is super tiny and a big disappointment.It does not provide adequate support or relief from the discomforts of pregnancy. I feel like I was mislead and I wasted my money.,1
Nosefrida Nasal Aspirator with addtional 20 Hygiene Filters,If you are continuing to torture yourself and child with an old fashioned bulb suction stop now and buy this device. This helps your new born breathe and sleep better in less time than it takes to clean one nostril with a squeeze bulb. This is my first review with my first child and I recommend this and wish I had seen it sooner. It would have been more rest for the baby and more peace of mind for us parents.,5
Custom Baby Girl Boutique - Safari 13 PCS Crib Bedding,"Let me start by saying. If you read the reviews on this set someone else says it is brown zebra not black. So before I added this set to my registry I knew it what I was going to get. I like the brown better because I didn't have a white or black crib I have cognac. It is a very nice set, I really like it and so does my husband! Nobody else in our small town would have gotten this one either so Resell is looking good! ;)",5
"Gerber 4 Count Rolled Birdseye Prefold Diaper, Multi color",These are a nice burp cloth. Not too thick or not too thin. I like the pretty colors too. Soft.,5
Skip Hop Dash - Canvas-Chocolate,"I love this bag... It's roomy and has plenty of pockets to keep everything organized.  But once I fit my extra set of clothing, recieving blankets, diapers and wipes, there isn't a lot of extra room left.  Since I breastfeed, this is fine, because I'm not toting around extra bottles and formula.  But if I were bottle feeding, I don't think there would be enough room for all the extras...  But a big plus is my husband has no proble carrying the bag, even if I am holding the baby!",4
Boppy Bare Naked Pillow,"I found the boppy pillow awkward and uncomfortable for nursing. I am an average sized person and slimmed up fairly fast after giving birth, and I found the boppy difficult to get around my midsection. I even watched a YouTube video thinking I was missing something. For me, it was easier to use a couple of normal pillows for breastfeeding. My daughter was too small to enjoy it in the first few months, it would swallow her. By the time she was two months, she would squirm or roll out of it. The best use I did find for it was to sit on it, like a donut, to relieve pressure after I gave birth.",2
Go-Pod P7000 in Quicksilver/Yellow Color and ** BONUS ** Tooth Tissues!,We bought 2 Go-Pods for our twin daughters when they were about 6 months and love the Go-Pods.  We really didn't start using them everyday until 7 months.  It keeps 1 baby occupied and in whatever room I am in when I change her sister.  It's also a change of scenery from crawling.  We plan on taking the Go-Pods with us when we travel next month to see my parents.  Very easy to open and close.  The girls are 9 months now and enjoy the Go-Pods even more now.  Can easily change height on them as baby grows.,5
Baltic Amber Baby Teething Necklace [Color: Cognac Bean / Length 12.5&quot;],"Beautiful neclace! Fits rather large on my 6 month old, but is comfortable for him. He drools a lot and gets chafed under his neck rolls so we wrap it around his wrist 3 times and it is really cute. We get tons of compliments :)",5
DaVinci Kalani 3 Drawer Changer in Cherry,We bought this product so much cheaper online rather than at the store. It has a lot of space and it was nice to put small baby to change his diapers.,5
Baby Belt Infant Stool Backpacks And Baby Carriers Babie Seat Carrier Baby Carrier Stool Baby Product Oxford cloth Toddler belt baby summer infant belt stool Mothercare Baby Hipseat Belt Toddler Carrier Hip Seat red wine,"My son is tall and likes to be held.  this gadget allows me to carry him while I'm running errands and doing things around the house.  The little plastic stool is sturdy, but after a while it seems as if he is trying to readjust his seating, so it may not be comfortable for his butt after a while.  But who knows as he is still in the process of learning how to express himself verbally.  it still does the trick of allowing me to carry my tall baby while getting things done.",5
"Colgate Classica I Foam Crib Mattress, White","I had no idea what mattress to get, they all look the same! I thought I'd prefer a coil sprung mattress but then found that this one had won awards so got this... I'm so glad I did. It fits the crib wonderfully, and is so light which is great considering how frequently I have to change the sheets. It delivered to a military box address too which was awesome. This seems well made and like it will last.",5
"Graco Lauren Dressing Table, White","Easy to assemble. We didn't need the wheels and it looks fine with out them. Easy to assemble, sturdier than similar priced ones.",4
"Summer Infant Quickchange Portable Changing Pad, Black","We've been using this (when we are on the go) for a few months now, and it's been working great!  It's a very handy size, so it fits very well in a small diaper bag. And if it gets a little messy, it wipes right off.",5
"Skip Hop Bento Diaper Tote Bag, Black","After agonizing for months over which diaper bag to buy, I finally decided on this bag in blue/grey.  It's not perfect, but fits a fair amount and doesn't look too ""babyish"" and doesn't look like a purse, either.  I absolutely love the stroller straps.  They are EXTREMELY convenient.  I would very highly recommend buying a bag with these straps.  That was the best advice I received when setting up my registry.  This bag has lots of hidden pockets which definitely comes in handy!",4
"Sassy Baby Food Nurser, Colors May Vary",I ordered these two blue bottles because of good ratings. But did not work for us. There are too many parts to clean. I don't mind cleaning too many parts but it leaks terribly. I haven't even opened the second bottle. I am not sure I can return the second bottle since I have opened the package and used one bottle once. Dollar 6 down the drain. I would not recommend to anybody.,1

"Carters Easy Fit Jersey Crib Fitted Sheet, Pink","We needed a plain sheet as our daughter started to get too interested in the wingdings and animal shapes on her first sheets. Too much time exploring and not enough napping. This sheet solved that while at the same time being softer and warmer. Upgrade. We had no problems with shrinking or trouble fitting on the mattress (her mattress is about six inches high- maybe a taller mattress would have trouble, though there seems to be plenty of slack for a mattress two to three inches taller) and it has held up well after many washes. Getting two more so we can have some to rotate when we're washing them.",5

Safe Traffic Systems GD10201PWB Safe Rider Travel Vest Large Large 50 - 80 lb and 45 - 57 Inches - Pink,"I am writing this to respond to the rather negative review that is also placed here. We have been using one of these for over 2 years. It really isn't any harder to use than a booster seat. Our 5yo son does most of it himself now. He puts on the vest and threads the seatbelt properly on his own. He can also unbuckle himself and get out without assistance. It takes no where near """"5 minutes"""" to put on. We feel this is a great alternative to a booster seat. Please do not let 1 person who can't figure it out to dissuade you from buying it. I really do not see why this ignorant person had to go out of her way to post drivel in multiple places. I am just going to say look at the timeline s here we have used it for years and she can't figure it out in a few weeks and gets mad.",5
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive","I absolutely love these bags! We bought one for our son's snack bag for preschool last year and loved it so much that we purchased one for each family member and a few of the smaller ones as well. They do shrink very slightly if you dry them in the drier, but they hold up very well.",5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Melodies and Lights Deluxe Gym,"I bought this for my newborn grandson, and he absolutely LOVES it.  There is just enough activity for him, not so much as to over-stimulate.It's very easy to assemble, and I'd consider it one of my better purchases for my little angel.  :)",5
"Snuggin Go Infant Positioner, Black",This product did not come with instructions so I am not sure that I am using it effectively.  It seems to squish my daughter and make her more uncomfortable and I think it made her perspire.,1
"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","Very attractive design. My daughter treated it like any other toys, put it into her mouth. She is barely 5 months, the rasberry is still a little big for her. It might be too early to introduce this teether.",4
Medela Harmony Manual Breast Pump,This manual pump is great for the occasional trip away from baby. It s very small and light-weight and it works surprisingly well. I've used this pump when I am away from my son for one or two feedings and it is so easy to carry in a medium-sized purse or small bag. It only takes about 20 minutes for me to pump both sides...what a life-saver.,5
Fisher-Price: Kick &amp; Play Bouncer,"I had received the soothing massage bouncer from Fisher Price when my son was born.  It was great for when my son needed to chill out, but there was nothing to play with.I went to a playdate at a friend's home and she had this bouncer.  I asked if my son could try it out.  He was always a kicker...even in the womb and he LOVED this in about 5 seconds.  He quickly figured out that the lights and sounds came on when he was kicking and he just kept smiling and babbling to the toys.  He loves lights and music from some of his other toys, so the fact that he was excited by this bouncer, wasn't totally surprising.I came home and told my husband how this had really caught his attention and kept him busy for quite awhile. (he is 12 weeks old and he stayed in it for 20 minutes)And the next day I went out and purchased one.  And as expected it has been a wonderful purchase and my son just loves this bouncer.I know that he is already 12 weeks old, so he won't be able to use this as long as if I had gotten it sooner, but my husband and I agreed that it was definately worth the price for his enjoyment and a great, safe place to put him to play.",5
Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"Its so simple yet so effective, I would definitely recommend it. She still doesn't like but it works better than all the others I've tried.",5
CTA Digital 2-in-1 iPotty with Activity Seat for iPad,If you are seriously considering this product.

Trying handing you child one of these when they're on the potty or better yet read to them !,1
"Munchkin Mighty Grip Trainer Cup 2-Pack, 8 oz, Colors Vary",My twin girls destroy the soft spout pretty quick. That is why I rate these bottles with 3 stars.You can buy the replacement spouts on Munchkin website. They are 2.99 for a pack of 2. Hope that helps everyone out.,3
"Skip Hop 4-Piece bumper-free Crib Bedding Set, Alphabet Zoo","I am always hesitant to buy online but this was perfect!  Great quality, super cute and very comfortable materials for baby!",5
BABYBJORN Soft Bib 2 Pack - Red/Blue,I love this bib! As soon as we got it the clean-up time for our little one significantly decreased! It cleans very easily in the sink and decreases laundry. The only thing that bothers me is the rubber neck strap. I have to be careful not to accidentally strap my little one's hair in it. And if I don't take the bib off when he is done he is able to pull the strap loose and throw the bib. It's only happened a couple of times though. I would still certainly buy this product again if it were to break. Pretty much I love this bib!!!,5

"JJ Cole Polar BundleMe Bunting Bag, Shadow","I just purchased this pod and was very disappointed to find that the top opening has two zippers that meat in the middle. This means every time you want to open it you must open and unhinge one zipper and open a second one... who has time for that!? Why the heck didn't they just use a single detachable zipper? Just to add insult to injury the two zippers don't touch (they are sown in far apart) and create an opening right in the middle, which is almost a square inch which will allow all the wind and cold in. I am returning it tomorrow.",2
"Fisher-Price Calming Vibrations Cuddle Soother, Blue","We use this every night to help lull our baby girl to sleep.  She absolutely loves the soothing music it plays and by the time the music stops, she's asleep.  It has become part of her bedtime routine.  We had been using it for about 3 months and out of the blue it stopped working!  NOT GOOD!  I had to listen to my baby cry herself to sleep when this happened and it broke my heart that there was nothing I could do about it!  We literally only use it once a day.  Is this normal for this toy?  FYI we replaced the batteries twice already.  You can tell when the batteries need to be replaced because the music slows down.  We never let it get too slow because it sounds pretty creepy as the music slows down, so make sure you have 3 spare AA batteries on hand for when that happens.  BTW, I called Fisher Price and their customer service is wonderful, but there is no replacement mechanism available at this time, which is a shame because the elephant itself is still like new.  Perhaps in the near future it will become available.***I was considering returning it to the store to exchange for another one and when I put the old batteries back in, it started working again.  The only explanation I have is that my husband had put rechargeable batteries in the second time we changed them because the batteries died so quickly the first time and that those batteries did something to the mechanism over the month they were in there.  It's strange because when it died I had tried to put regular batteries in and it didn't work then, so I'm really not sure what happened to the mechanism that night and if it may die again suddenly like that.  But in any case I wanted to add this bit of advice-DON'T USE RECHARGEABLE BATTERIES IN THIS TOY!***",5
"Regalo Extension for Safety Gate, White, 6&quot;",I purchased this to go along with the 58&#34; wide gate because I have a 66&#34; opening. It does fit like it is suppose to but the whole assembly is wobbly. Read my other review on that if you want the whole story.,3

The First Years Ignite Stroller,"The last thing we wanted was to purchase more strollers (we already have 4). However, nothing we own was ideal for a Disney World trip with our two boys. Our Jeep Liberty stroller is awesome, but cumbersome for travel (heavy, awkward, doesn't fit regular trunk space). Our umbrella isn't comfortable for a long day, and has no storage. Our sit-and-stand won't allow our 4-year old to rest well, and is also big and heavy (especially once you add > 50 pounds of boys and your own stuff). A bigger car rental or stroller rentals cost more than purchasing two of these strollers, therefore, it was a great investment for future trips. We wanted lightweight strollers, that fold compactly to fit in a standard car rental with luggage and get on and off buses easily and have storage space for all the things you end up carrying around the airport and theme parks.My husband's big concern was weight and maneuverability. At 14 lbs, it's not bad for one-handed carrying, and our 1 1/2 year old can easily push our 4-year old throughout our house easily! Got the red stripe (best price) - I'm not a fan of red, but it is more of a ""wine"" color and is actually quite sharp. Haven't taken it out of the house yet, but the sun shade is bigger than I expected (bigger than our Jeep umbrella's). The recline seems to be good enough to keep the boys comfortable if they nap. I was able to recline it and push it back up while my 1-year old was sitting in it. He fell asleep in it while his brother was pushing him around the house. The storage is plenty for a lightweight stroller, and it's sturdy enough to hang bags off of. I read about side pockets in other reviews (which are not pictured and didn't come with them, but are apparently supposed to) - so the manufacturer is sending them out.  They're really protective fabric for the hinges, but may function like little pockets.  So they have great customer service, too! Can't wait to use them on our trip!Update: We used the strollers during Labor Day weekend at a festival and shopping. These strollers easily held a small cooler, extra clothes, our beverages, freebies/purchases, and I hung my diaper bag on the handle. My boy could even fit his little water bottle in the hinge pocket. The strollers handled well on dirt and grass, and it was nice to easily maneuver inside stores. It was even easy for one person to push both strollers! Opening and storage was a breeze. So glad we got these! The little one fell asleep comfortably. I do wish the shade was adjustable, but I'll probably just attach a bigger one.Update 2:  These were wonderful for our trip to Disney World! The cup holder and storage pockets were functional and useful. I could fit our jackets, extra clothes, etc. in the baskets. Yes, the back bars are a nuisance when you want to pull things out, but probably the only con that I can think of. I just made sure that our bags weren't large, and I hung our cooler bag on the handles for easy access.  The shade attachment worked fine on the one stroller, and I didn't find the need for my older child (since he could wear a hat/sunglasses). When they napped, we just covered them by hanging a blanket/jacket on the shade. It was so nice to move easily through the crowds. It was a lot more convenient to gate check umbrella style strollers than full-size ones.  It's nice to have a stroller that accommodates a child up to 50 pounds because the parks can wear out any child. I can't wait to use them on our next vacation.",5
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella","so i just took the car seat out of the box and loved it right away. it was light, the straps were very easy to adjust. i was kinda iffy about the pink because it looks really bright in the picture but it not even that bight in person, and the delivery was quick i got it in two days. i would recomend it or even buy another one when we get another car!!!",5
Hugamonkey Indoor Outdoor Travel Cotton Comfort Safety Newborn Infant Child Baby Sling Carrier Stone Small,"Love it.  Light, easy to use, I have purchased 3 to keep in different bags and highly recommend it.  I first used this sling on my 11lb dog and now that I have a 2 month baby, it has become an even more &#34;must&#34; in my household.",5
"The First Year's Infant To Toddler Tub with Sling, Blue","For my first child, I used a Safety 1st tub (which has its issues, too, but was for the most part pretty good).  We had to purchase a new one for our second child and this was the only brand available at the store where we did our baby shopping.I found the sling to be difficult to adjust, and it didn't seem to allow our baby to be in the water while being bathed - he was sort of suspended above it. Once he became too big for the sling, I moved him to the tub itself and found the shape of it to be completely useless.  I don't understand how the manufacturer could expect so many different sizes of babies to fit in that shape - he pushed up on the end of the tub with his feet, and it was difficult to keep a good grip on him while bathing him because the tub did nothing to help hold him up.  After a few attempts at using the tub, I threw it out and went straight to the store to get the Safety 1st tub.  Now I remember why I like it so much.",1
COZY BABY NASAL ASPIRATOR - This Snot Sucker Cleans Away Baby's Blocked Nose FAST - Its The Best Nasal Suction Tool On The Market To Relieve Blocked Nasal Congestion Quick - No Filters - Washable And Reusable - Great Baby Shower Gift - 100% Money Back Guarantee.,"I purchased this product because my precious 2 month old has had the worst congestion and runny nose! At first I was thinking how gross, sucking the snot out of the kids nose using your mouth. Ewwww... But now that I have this product it's not gross at all! It's amazing! The way it's designed the snot cannot come back up the straw so you don't have to worry about getting snot in your mouth. (Sorry so detailed) It works everytime like a charm! My baby doesn't seem to mind it at all either! Way more suction then those ball suckers cause you are the sucker. Lol :-) I will be purchasing this item for future baby shower gifts as its AMAZING!!!!",5
"Skip Hop Versa Diaper Bag, Cream Links","Love this bag - very spacious - a little larger than I thought it would be, but it looks awesome!",5
"Safety 1st Sit Booster Seat, Green",I have one for each of my girls.  They are perfect to help a toddler/young preschooler sit at the table.  The straps make it very sturdy even on stools.  Because of the plastic it is very easy to clean off and the straps can go in the wash if they get nasty.  I am so happy I didn't get the other booster seat I was looking at that cost $50 more!,5
"HALO Early Walker SleepSack Micro Fleece Wearable Blanket Pink, Large","This is perfect for keeping my daughter warm during the winter.  Its too long, despite buying the size chart recommendation so we just don't let her walk around in it.  We love it otherwise!",4
"Baby Jogger City Mini GT Single Stroller, Shadow/Orange","I pretty much love this stroller. It's light, smooth, and super comfy for my one year old. It folds easily and locks so it doesn't come apart. The sun shade is fantastic and doubles as a wind shade and my kids love the peek-a-boo windows on the shade. There are two problems with the stroller. The basket is small and you can't get anything in there anyway. You can sort of shove a small purse, blanket or sweatshirt in from the side but that's it. No diaper bag (even a small one) or even a shopping bag at the mall (unless it's plastic). I have a hook on the handle but I usually just take only the bare essentials when I use this stroller. The other thing is that you can't stand it up when closed, it topples over. Not deal breakers but certainly things that could be improved!",4
"Embroidered Toddler Waffle Blanket - 100% Cotton - With fun Animal print - Forest Teddy, Neutral",This wonderful blanket is larger than I thought it would be - perfect for a toddler bed.  Our little love is growing and her little baby blankets don't actually cover her anymore; this blanket does.  It's light and perfect for a child during the summer or for a child who is not fond of heavy blankets.  It's super cute and I love that it's cotton.  This would make a terrific baby shower gift if you want to give a blanket.  The cotton is soft and the waffle weave is a great texture for little hands without being scratchy.  I'm very pleased!,5
'Medela 21mm Personalfit Breastshield 2-pack (Non-retail Packaging),I got this new breastshields after using the size medium which came with the pump. My nipple didn't fit like shown on the instructions. After switching milking became easier and smoother. Would have used XS if it existed.,4
The First Years Extra Tall Decor Gate,"After researching walk-thru baby gates until my head was spinning - I bought this one because they had it at my local Target and it looked cool.  So glad I got this one.  I am using it at the top of the stairs to separate two cats from two Golden Retrievers. (I know that manufacturer does not recommend this gate for the top of the stairs, but there are no children in my household.) Had hoped that the baby gate situation was temporary so we have been using a battery of 'regular' baby gates, w/ mixed results.  AND I was SICK of moving/climbing over them every time I wanted to go downstairs. After 5 months it does not appear the kiddies are all going to play nice - so I needed a better solution.  This gate is it!  My 'doorway' was exactly 36"" so I needed the gate and 2 small extenders.  At that it was still a tight fit - but it is secure!!!  I was pleased that the extenders came w/ this gate. Have seen many that charge still extra.Also the gate looks really nice.  Which is important since it appears it is going to be a permanent fixture.  I didn't want an ugly plastic one.  And I really didn't want to have to drill into my walls to mount the gate.I do wish the opening was just an inch so wider but it is certainly adequate.",4
"Board Book Albums Take Your Pix, Blue",Great baby album and the pages are easy for little ones to flip with the cutouts.  Only complaint is that the picture frame on the cover fell off and we had to glue it back it on.,4
JOTO Premium Screen Protector Film HD Ultra Clear (Invisible) for the ASUS MeMO Pad FHD 10 Inch Tablet ME302C with Lifetime Replacement Warranty (3 Pack),"Don't make the same mistake i did...buy a different brand. These are the worst screen protectors i've experienced. When you go to pull the back sheet off after you have the screen in place and bubbles removed, the screen protector would come up off of the surface of the tablet with the sheet. The product says there is a lifetime replacement, but the package the product comes in does not have the name, address or phone number of the manufacturer or distributor. On top of that, Tech Vendor says all warranty concerns need to be addressed with the manufacturer.",1
FISHER PRICE SINGING STAR GYM,"We bought this toy after many had told us how wonderful it was.  My daughter has laid under it since she was probably 2 mo. old.  She is currently 5 mo. old and still enjoys laying underneath it, any time now she will be able to sit up and we will change the position.  Sometimes we change the angle just a little bit and let her sit in her bouncy seat and play with it.  The toy is just so well made that just about any age/size baby can play with it.  I have nothing but good things to say about it.  Also, the sounds/voices are not annoying, they are quite nice and the low/high button is just right!  GREAT TOY!",5
Lil' Topper Sipper Caps,"This is a second set I've purchased as I have had much success with my other Lil' Topper sipper caps....in the event that I lose one, I want to be prepared!",5
"Boon Groovy + Modware Interlocking Plate and Bowl Set with Utensils,Blue/Orange","This plate and utensils are working out very well for us! The two blue dip cups are perfect for just that, and they are removable for the meals where you don't need them. They attach anywhere along the outside edge of the bigger orange plate. The two orange plates stay together, and the smaller one has deeper sides.As for the the utensils, they are shallow, which seems to be a good thing. We have a set of OXO Tot utensils that are deeper, and my young toddler usually leaves half the food on his spoon. But these he cleans with every bite. :-) The fork isn't the best for stabbing, but that's ok because it scoops just fine.The set is dishwasher safe, but not microwave safe.",5
Lambs &amp; Ivy Peek a Boo Jungle 5-pc Bedding Set,"My wife and I aren't finding out ahead of time if we're having a boy or girl, so we're trying to keep the baby room gender neutral for now. This crib bedding looks great and works perfect for either a boy or girl.",5
"aden + anais 2 Pack Muslin Burpy Bib, Princess Posie","I love all of Aden & Anais products!  They are MUST haves for baby.  I have the swaddle blankets, washcloths and burp cloths.  Love them all!",5
"Fisher-Price Infant-To-Toddler Rocker, Blue/Green",I bought this for my six month old son and he loves it. It's bright and colorful and surprisingly easy to assemble. It's great for naps or playtime!,5
Luminous Black Mini-Lantern Tea Light Holder - Baby Shower Gifts &amp; Wedding Favors,"One lantern for $15. Not a deal, maybe I didn't read the description thoroughly but, the picture led me to believe I would be getting two lanterns.  Larger, better quality candle lanterns are available in stores.  Don't waste your time.",1
"Kiddopotamus Dreamsie Sleeper with Sleeves Microfleece Large, Ivory",we tried several different kinds of sleep sacks and this one is the best.it's easy to get on - even with a wriggly baby- and it keeps our daughter toasty without getting her too hot.,5
"Skip Hop Zoo Little Kid Luggage, Dog",It is super cute and perfect for a young toddler.  It rolls nicely and is capable of holding a substantial amount of items.,5
B kids Loop Around Wrist Plush Rattle,"The wrist rattle is adorable, but my 8 month old grandson found that it was in the way, which made him frustrated. So, he just plays with it off his wrist.",3
"Britax Monarch Booster Car Seat, Royal Racer","This booster seat is one of the best we have found so far. My son is 5 and he loved the colors and the look of it. It made him feel more like he was sitting in a big boy seat. The seat belt fits snug to his body and the car seat sides really protect his head unlike several other seats we have looked at which allowed waay too much movement. My husband and I take all of our kids safety very seriously when driving and this car seat is one of the best we have found. It's a little more pricey than others out there, but when it comes to the safety aspect, it is well worth the money.",4
Sesame Street 1-2-3 Learn With Me Potty Chair -Elmo All Star,If you want to spend your time wrestling to pull a potty apart and again to put it together this is the potty for you.  This definitely was NOT designed with ease in mind.  It takes longer for me to put it back together than for my son to use it.  Hate it.  Need to buy one with and easy slide out bowl.,1
"phil&amp;teds Traveller Crib, Black","I borrowed a Traveller from a friend for an overseas trip with my 10-month old and liked it so much that I bought my own.  It's lightweight, easy to set up, packs small enough to fit into a suitcase, and definitely fills the need for a playpen/crib in a hotel room.  However, we just returned from a week-long trip, and my almost-brand new Traveller exhibited some serious quality issues.  The zipper broke on the stuff sack, the zipper came unstitched on the top panel, and one of the tightening pulls on a leg came off.  My friend's Traveller has shown none of these problems, so maybe I just got a bum one.  The Phil & Ted's warranty, though, seems much more restrictive than similar high-end producers so we'll see what they say.",3
Munchkin 3 Count Stay Put Suction Bowl,This is the worst way to spend your money. My 11 month old who was born prematurely and has the fine motor skills of a 9 month old ripped this bowl off his tray within a nano second. Lame.,1
"Delta Universal 6 Drawer Dresser, Black Cherry","Beautiful dresser, not as big as i thought and the drawers don't pull out as far as i think they should, i can see how stuff will get lost in the back of the dresser drawers. Nice for the price tho!",4
Lamaze: Pupsqueak the Puppy,"My 10 month old daughter is developmentally delayed, and it's not always easy to get her attention.  This toy, though, is sure to get her excited.  She loves to feel his crinkly ears, and bat at his jingly paws.  She flaps her arms and kicks excitedly when I squeeze his nose and he barks.  I got it for her at Christmas, and she still loves it!It is one of the best toys I've bought her, and I've bought a lot of toys.  I can't recommend it enough!",5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","My newborn daughter LOVES this mat!  The music isn't annoying, and its fun to watch your baby kick the keys and hear the music play.  The mat is also great for tummy time, just relocate the top bar to it's &#34;ground setting&#34; and the mirror can rest on it so baby can stare and entertain herself :)",5
"Urban Infant Tot Cot Daycare, Planet","I ordered three for my preschoolers and they work great, fit in a small cubby and wash well.  Although pictured with a mini frog in the pocket, the little stuffie wasn't in any of the nap sets.",4
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Miracle, Black/Silver, Cotton Mix",The Miracle series is amazing! Very easy to put on and adjust. You can adjust the back support to distribute the weight between your shoulders and hips. You can also adjust the position of the baby as he/she grows (one of the best features) I didn't think I would be impressed with baby gear but I am. Baby sits very comfortable and the mix of cotton and mesh keeps the baby from overheating. I recommend buying the bib and cover as well.,4
Just Born 4-Pack Flannel Receiving Blankets - Animal Adventure,"For the price, these are excellent receiving blankets. I just wish they were slightly larger, because my 9 week old son has already grown too big for us to swaddle using these blankets. He weighs about 11 lbs now. I still use them all the time but can't swaddle him in them anymore.",4
"Chicco Caddy Hook On Chair, Red","I use this high chair in a restaurant. It is fantastic. Easy to use, easy to clean, and durable. Best one I have found",5
"Two's Company Anti-Mates Nesting Animal Dolls Set, Set of 5","Gave it to 3 year old granddaughter and she loves it. She talks to each piece as she puts them together.  No batteries, no bells and whistles, just imagination. Added bonus: doesn't take up much space.",5
Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature First Sips Weaning Cup - 4m - 5 Oz. (Pink),We bought this for our second child in hopes we could move off bottles faster. Tried it at 4 months and flow was entirely too fast. Tried again at 6 months and flow is still too fast for her. Since this is meant for beginning drinkers the flow should be regulated like a slow flow nipple.,2
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","I wanted to install this to block off my kitchen but I have curved molding at the floor line and the way this is designed, it has to be square against the wall in order to hold.  But because there are multiple widths, with additional gates, I moved it to my French door connecting my living room to my deck.  It is high enough my greyhound does not try to get over it, it is very easy to install and to open and close and it looks attractive.",5
Summer Infant Fold 'n Store Tub Time Bath Sling,"Now I feel secure to  bathe our baby !!You really think in a practical, colored, portable safetty baby product.Than you !!",5
The First Years Close and Secure Sleeper,"Its an great item for a new born baby.If you have not bought a crib or want your baby to share the bed this is a fantastic item. Its light and portable. You can move it around the house easily and lay it down where ever.The only complaint i have is that the leg portion is fixed(yellow piece) and  the length is only 24"""". My daughter outgrew this in 5 weeks. So consider this before you buy.",4
DaVinci Alpha Mini Rocking Crib - Natural,"Baby is not here yet, so haven't tested it with the baby. Installed it myself in about an hour. Came with a 4 page manual, but the instructions for installing the crib was on one page. Read other reviews about the flimsy mattress that came with this crib, so I bought theDream On Me 3"" Spring Coil Portable Crib Mattress, White. Fits perfectly.  Now have to go by many sheets and a waterproof mattress pad.Crib is light.  Like that it had wheels.  If you don't want wheels, just take them off, and the crib becomes a ""rocker.""I do see a potential major weakness: the mattress support board.  It is a piece of thin, maybe 1/4"" MDF board, surrounded or enclosed by 4 pieces of pine wood. There's another piece of wood (2 inch X 15 inch) going across the board, acting as a brace.  If for whatever reason your child jumps up and down on the board, I think either the board will snap, crack or pop. Something to consider. I've attached images.",4
Activity Mushroom Toddler Toy,"I got this for my 9 month old for Xmas and am now regretting it. As another reviewer pointed out, there is no on/off switch or volume control. But the sound is super sensitive. It starts playing when no one's even near it (or even the same room) it even goes off in the middle of the night. So annoying!! My other big problem is that the base is not weighted. In fact the top is much heavier than the base, so every time my baby pulls up to stand to play the toy falls over. We've wedged it into a corner to keep it up and he actually does like playing with it which is the only reason for 2 stars instead of 1. Definitely would not recommend this toy to anyone, which is a bummer since it's so cute!",2
Children's Desk by P'kolino - Orange,I bought this desk on a whim because I liked the way it looks and thought it would fit perfectly in a corner of my kitchen. I was right! and thankfully it is very sturdy and looks very cute. The kids are now fighting over it which is the only down side!,5
Zoli Baby On-the-Go Snack/Formula Dispsenser - 2 oz,"I was so excited to buy this formula after my cheap Sassy one wasn't it for me.I had hoped for the Zo-Li Formula Dispenser to provide these:Formula won't spill into other compartments - CHECK!BPA free - CHECK!Hold up to 4 scoops - CHECK!Ease of use - Oops, Have to CROSS THIS OUT! There is no way to use this dispenser with one hand when baby is turning into Incredible Hulk and wants to eat NOW!Formula can flow easily without getting caught up anywhere - NOPE NOPE NOPE, you still have to shake it, swish it and tap tap tap tap to get all the formula out.So, 3 out of 5.As my title says, it's not for formula. Maybe it would be better for snacks, but that's not what I bought it for.It gets messy with the formula because in travel, the formula of course swooshes around in the individual bins, so when you unscrew each, the bottoms all have formula stuck to it. So:1) It leads to waste of formula2) It's not really very sanitary, because if you accidentally screw a bin that had been placed on a dirty table on top of another bin with formula or snack in it, then you just contaminated the formula/snack.So I'm back to my $[...] Sassy after paying $[...] w/ shipping for this. Still searching for the right formula dispenser...  I may try the Raz Pak, it looks like it's what I'm looking for. Wish me luck!",3
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Bottle Brush, Blue","I received this brush in the Avent starter kit at a baby shower. My initial reaction was that there must be something better since the nipple cleaner on the end serves no purpose. I was wrong. I went back to work after 3 months and continued to breastfeed until 15months. That means TONS of bottles and pump parts to hand wash each night. I became obsessed with finding a bottle brush that would last, and have a nipple cleaner on the end. It does not exist. The Avent brush is by far the best brush. The bristles are soft enough to wiggle around inside almost all of the parts, but they are also durable. At this point, my daughter is 2, and I still use the same Avent brush that came with that original kit! Of course, it gets used way less now, on sippy cups and, well, wine glasses... It works great for those too.I highly recommend this brush to anyone. Don't waste money on the other ones that last 30 days or less.",5
"NUK Large Learner Cup, 10 Ounce","If you have a child that's struggling with giving up the bottle, this is a great transition container. It feels and looks almost like a bottle and makes the adjustment a little bit easier!",4
"Medela Quick Clean Breastmilk Removal Soap, 6 Ounce","I'm reusing my medela bottles after they were in storage for two years. They always looked cloudy to me, even after sanitizing and running through the dishwasher. Now, I just soak overnight with this soap and then either rinse or use a microwave sterlizer. The bottles and pump parts look amazing- no residue at all and much easier than scrubbing. So glad I found this!",5
Sassy: Baby Food Nursers 4oz - 2pk(Green) [Baby Product],My sister used these when she had her first child and she seemed to love them. I found them more of a hassle to use. It would be easier to use a larger nipple on the bottle style you're already used (Dr Brown's size 4 or Y nipple for feeding)then to have to fool with all 5 parts and pieces of this feeder. You also have to take your time when plunging because the plate will slip sideways and you squish all the food out and it makes a huge mess.,2
Uncle Goose Chinese Character Blocks (32 pcs),"I bought these for my children, who are being brought up bilingual. These have been great. The kids are able to pair the characters with the images. I know that these will be in use for years. And they are so well made. They are expensive for what they are but I think they are worth it.",4
"Badger Basket Three Basket Set, Pink","These baskets are too cute! In the picture I thought there were a medium pink but they are more of a pastel, lighter pink in person. But, they are so cute!!! My daughter is five and we have stored her dvd's and vtech games in these on her white book case. her walls are purple and they are a great accent color. =)The Frog and the Princess Seller was great too! She has the best communication from a seller I've ever had. Answers quick and lets you know whats going on.Thanks!!!!",5
Kids II Baby Einstein Discover and Play Piano,"My 7 month old loves this piano!  The keys are soft which is something I didn't realize until after I received it, but it's very nice.",5
Cocalo Noah and Friends Window Valance,I bought two of these for the large window in my infant boys room. It goes great with the entire Cocalo Noah and Friends set. I am pleased with this purchase!,5
"The UMMY: BPA-free 100% Natural Rubber Pacifier with Round Nipple, 6-12 months","My baby is 6 months old and he's not a fan of this passifier. It looks like it may be a bit too big, as he makes a gag face when I try to give it to him.However, at this point I have not found a passifier that he will use yet and I've tried several. Hoped this would be the one.",2
8x10 BABY &amp; ME Picture &amp; Poetry Photo Gift Frame ~ Cream/Burgundy in BLACK Frame ~ Heartfelt Keepsake Picture Frame for an Expecting Mom/Mother to hold an Ultrasound/Sonogram Photo!,Basic but nice product i would recommend it.  It was a hit as a gift with nice quality paper used.,3
"HABA Pure Nature Clutching Figure, Freddie Frog","It is very cute and the material is very nice, good quality, however the frog is really tiny. I would buy it again for babies.",4
BRICA Stretch-to-Fit Window Shade,"This product, while it does offer protection from the sun, is not a great product. The suction cups do not stay suctioned to the window for long.  Needless to say we had it up in our window for maybe two full days before taking it down.  Gets frustrating having to re-suction to the window each time getting in the car.",2
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,This baby monitor does the job.  As with anything else one needs to read the instructions in order to have successful results.  I have no problems with this monitor.,5
Natural Comfort Double Electric or Battery Breast Pump,"my grandmother bought this pump for me and not wanting to hurt her feeling i made up different reasons not to use it. its very loud, it pulls too much on the nipple, and u cant get the suction right, either its too much suction or not enuff. also i never could get the dual part goin on. the bottles moved around too much i could only get one seal at a time...it usually took about 1 hr to get 6 oz.now i'm about to spend tha money on a pump in style because it is 1 of 2 pumps rated for full time pumping. ...",1
BabyComfyNose Nasal Aspirator (Blue),"My 10 month old daughter freaked out and screamed over those bulb nose suckers. This BabyComfyNose, She looks at it inquisitively and when I get near her nose with suction started she laughs and turns away. It tickles her nose but works amazingly at drawing the snot out. When I can get her to hold her head still. Easy to clean. 6 Parts to clean with a quick hot water and soap rinse.",5
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black",Love this stroller. Perfect size and weight. MY five month old fits perfect. The right front wheel gets stuck once and awhile but thats my only compliant.,4
Sassy Wonder Wheel,"This toy is super interesting for my son, it spins for a LONG time and the noise catches his attention, but sadly the suction cup doesn't work as well as I would like. The only thing we have gotten it to stick to without popping off almost immediately is glass, like on a sliding glass door.",4
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,I love love love love love this potty! I take it with me everywhere I go! it is so compact I put it in my diaper bag! And you have to get the bags that are made for it! You get a couple (Ithink 3) when you buy the potty itself! Perfect for pottying on the go!,5
"Taggies Colours Toy, Caterpillar",I bought this for my granddaughter who is 8 months.  It is really soft and she loves to play with all the tags.,5
"Infantino Twist and Fold Activity Gym, Vintage Boy","My son, Elliott, loves this activity gym. He is three months old. I easily assembled the gym, popped it out and placed him under the hanging animals. He kicked and was so excited. I wasn't sure if he was old enough to know how to 'play' with it. But he instantly enjoyed himself. He played until he fell asleep.I am pleased with the construction of this item. It seems very well built. It folds easily for storage. Then pops right back out again easily for play time! I am super happy we found this cute durable activity gym!",5
"Graphique Home Decal, Dr. Seuss One Fish Two Fish",It is big. It is colorful and it is easy to apply and reapply!!!Several teachers have commented on how great it looks on my wall!,5
Tommee Tippee 360 Sealer Diaper Disposal System Includes 4X Refill,"We use the Tippee to dispose of our poop bags for our dog.  Instead of stinking the garbage or attracting unwanted pests, we put the poop bags in the same as a diaper.  It work great to keep the odors down and the week we ran out of refills we saw just how great a job it does at that.  However, it does go through the refills fast and they aren't cheap; plus it does tend to jam with the poop bags because they are lighter than diapers (we know its not the intended use but it does a great job none the less).  We tried other ones, but this is the best for the purpose, once we get over the sticker shock of the refills!  Would we recommend it to others for the same purpose...yes...just be prepared for some bumps in the road.",4
"Prince Lionheart Playmat Plus, ABC",This is a great mat we bought for the playroom. Vibrant colors and design and love that it's 2-sided. Best part is that it doesn't make our small playroom smell chemically or plasticky like other playmats we had. Only reason not a 5 star is bc the material isn't super smooth. It has a texture and for a small baby we have to keep his skin covered. Baby loves to touch texture witg his hands though and I'm sure it will be fine when he's older,4
Sealy Baby Soft Ultra Mattress,"We recently purchased this mattress for the 3n1 Natural Crib. No problems noted with the mattress; however, our son (who is now 6 weeks old) doesn't sleep in the crib much just yet...",4
"Kidkusion Retractable Driveway Guard, Black, 18'","This does its job, but it sags more than I was hoping. I realize we could try to take the sleeves out and put them back in the ground at an angle, but that seems like a lot of work, so we'll probably just use it like it is. I do appreciate the roll-up feature, and it makes me less worried about my little one and his toys going into the street.",4
"Gerber 4 Pack Training Pants with Seat Protector, Boy, 3T","There were only two pairs of training pants, not four, as listed.  Did not bother to return them, though, because of the headache.",1
Sassy Illumination Station,Bought this for my 3 yr. old special needs grandson (due to being 4 months premature he is both medically and physically challenged) and he absolutely loves it!!,5
BRICA Fold N' Go Travel Bassinet,Folds up really easily. Light and neat to carry. Only criticism is the mattress is pretty hard. Easily remedied by purchasing another bassinette mattress or padding it out a bit.,4
Dreambaby Under The Door Gripper,This little gadget does exactly what it is supposed to do.  It holds teh door in place.  It does not scratch floors.  It is not a fabricy item that would get dusty or catch pet hair.  It is just so simple and so effective.  It's so easy to pop it on or off when you want to move the door.,5
Baby Bling Design Company Metamorphosis All Terrain Stroller,"I have written the company twice and have not heard a response. I have owned this for just over a year, its not my primary stroller, and it is falling apart. I bought this stroller to use on my farm and to take to the beach. It performs poorly on both terrains, so much for ATS. The Wheels are completely rusted out as are the snaps that connect the fabric to the stroller so it no longer is attached, the fabric is faded and the harness has never worked, it loosens instantly and my child ends up slouching down. I have taken good care of this stroller and yet it looks as if its been sitting outside for years. Do not buy this stroller!! I wish I had bought a BOB. Im thinking of buying one now and selling the Bling but I dont think I could give it away.",1
[Award Winning] Kidsme Food Feeder (Large size),"I got a mesh version of one of these feeders from a friend, but it was a pain to clean. This one was much easier and was a great way to feed her chunks of cooked veggies or soft fruits from about 6 months to 8 months old. Now she just prefers to eat chunks of food directly.",5
Pavlov'z Toyz Electronic Interactive Activity Baby Playpen,Ordered for my grand-baby girl. She's loving to be inside - happily plays on her own with the various distractions. Think she'll enjoy it for many months to come.,5
BABYBJORN Safe Step - Blue,My daughter is very petite so she likes to use this in the bathroom and everywhere in the house too!,5
Medela Pump &amp; Save Breastmilk Bags - 50 pack-5 oz,"These bags are grossly off on their measurement, they are not made to handle more than 3 oz. in the freezer once you account for expansion, and they are prone to leaking.  Stick with pumping into bottles and pouring into cheaper bags, like Lanolish, Target brand, or Nuk brand.",1
"JJ Cole Collections Storage Box, Cocoa Stripe, 11&quot;","I bought three of these to use in a storage bench to store toys. They look great and seem very sturdy. I like the metal handles. We will see how they hold up to the young 'un, but I think these will last a long time.",5
"Summer Infant 2 Pack Cotton Knit Swaddleme, Safari (Small/Medium)","These are supposed to fit sizes 7-14 pounds.  My twins are just under 10 pounds and the swaddles already don't fit.  Spend a little more and go with the Halo Swaddle Sleep sacks which work well, and also offer the option of swaddling with arms in or arms out.  The Halos also are more flexible as your baby grows, because the velcro closures can be stuck anywhere on the sack.  But if you buy Halo, buy the cotton, not the fleece, unless you live in a very cold place and keep your home cool.  We found the cotton works well, even on cold nights.",1
"GustBuster Metro Manual Umbrella, Paisley","I work downtown Manhattan and was seriously searching for an umbrella that would stand up to the rain and strong winds that occur there.  I had so many broken umbrellas because (I thought) I only spent $2 on my umbrella(s) when purchased from street vendors.  I finally decided to buy a good and expensive umbrella that would finally be an umbrella I could rely on.  This umbrella broke after two uses, and it wasn't even that windy.  I hate throwing money out of the window.  Don't even think this umbrella is better than the junkie ones sold on the street corner.",1
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","This gate is the best I have ever had.  It's better than I expected.  Was easy to put up and is simple to use, just lift up on it a little bit and push or pull it open.  You can let it close on its own or make it stay open very easily.",5
"Graco Affix Highback Booster Seat with Latch System, Atomic","Nice looking, sturdy and comfortable, it has a little snack compartment on one side and also a cup holder which are but quite useful especially during longer car trips!",5
Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Infant Starter Gift Set,"i love these bottles over the playtex ones we got for our kid, these don't leak and the price is perfect on amazon for getting this set and the other 5 bottle set as well",5
Baby Girl Bird Monthly Onesie Sticker with Chevron Pattern - Waterproof and Durable - Includes 1-12 Month Stickers,Love them!  Super cute. Everything I thought they would be and I would buy them all over again or give as a gift.,5
Regalo Easy Open 50 Inch Super Wide Walk Thru Gate - White,"My opening is 46 1/2"" so the 48 is to big and the 42 is to small.  To solve the problem I used 1 2x4 on one side and 1 1x4 on the other side.  Using the extra boards also gave me a place to secure the know cups which keeps the knobs from walking if a dog jumps on it, without having the cups screwed into the wall.The only reason I only gave 4 out of 5 stars is the fact that the description did not let me know there could be a problem with sizes inbetween 36 and 48,  It may be workable for most sizes but not the 46 1/2'.Overall the quality is awesome, ease of opening is also great.  I will try to find a 4"" extension or even cut the 6"" down slightly and if it doesn't present any issues fitting back with the gate panel, I will trim the 12"" as well and it will make the gate fit better.Easy to put together and install.",4
Bella B No Rinse Wash,I bought this no rinse wash to use for my son who hates getting his hair wet. I wanted to use it in place of his shampoo. It is too thick and sticky to use as that purpose. I use for emergencies only.,2
"Nickelodeon Deluxe Rocking Sofa, Sponge Bob","Great quality, light weight and my kids enjoy it so much! My daughter loves to rock so this is perfect. My 7 year old son loves it too! My kids are 7 and 2 and they can sit together on it. Well worth the money and it's super cute!!",5
"Bright Starts Step Stool, Oval Color varies","I purchased this for my daughter to assist in potty training and it's just perfect! It is very sturdy and easy for her to climb up on. The rubber on top prevents her from slipping however, there are no rubber grips on the bottom. So if you are using this on a slick surface like tile or linoleum you would want to use a rug or something underneath it to prevent accidents.",4
"Evenflo Triumph 65 DLX Seat, Lincoln","Instead of having the belt in the middle of the seat (at the front bottom part), it is so helpful to have it on the side.  Having gone through several car seats, this one has been our favorite, by far.  You don't have to pump iron in order to feel like you've got the belt tight enough.",5
"Munchkin Click Lock 2 Count Sippy Cup, 9 ounce","We have been trying different cups with our 14 month old and having no success until this cup.  He took to it right away, and loves the softness of the sippy top.  The click lock feature is great for us moms of &#34;advanced maternal age&#34; because you can hear it click in an don't necessary need to see it.  There isn't a separate valve to lose, either. The cup and the lid...nothing else.  He chucked it across the room and no spill.  I'm impressed, and going back for more!",5
"Lambs &amp; Ivy Nap Mat, Pink Monkey",I purchased this for my granddaughter.  My daughter in law says that she loves the Hello Kitty mat.  I would purchase again.,5
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"2003 owned it but,had no clue few years later would have other baby...I do miss and think I will get other one..it rocks them side to side which is great if you have a baby with reflux like mines does now.he was born one month ago on mothers day..may 9th 2010.The music is calming and the fishes are cute.I don't like it that is huge and takes up room..if you live in house is good but,in small apt like me is to much.",5
Crown Crafts The Original NoJo BabySling by Dr. Sears in Black Chambray,I love this carrier!  It was great when I ventured out to the grocery store the other day by myself.  Usually I would just take his car seat in with me and hope for the best.  We'd make it half way through the store and he would get fussy.  I'd spend the rest of the time carring him in one arm and trying to push the cart with the other.  Now I'm able to make it all the way through the store with him in his carrier.  My sholders did ache a little by the time  we were done shopping but that's to be expected when carrying a 15 lb. baby around for over an hour.,5
Infantino Right Angle Tummy Triangle,"This tummy time mat did not work for my daughter as some of the other reviewers have described.  She hated tummy time before and she screams and cries if you leave her there for more than a minute, even with re-positioning and trying to play with her using toys.  Maybe my child is just difficult but for us this did not work any better than her other tummy time mats.",3
Music Blocks Baby Maestro Opera Cartridge,This one keeps cracking us up. My two year old mimics some of the song (the chuckle part). This one is my personal favorite so far.,5
"Leachco Preggle Comfort Air-Flow Body Pillow, Ivory/Khaki",The preggle was too thick & stiff so it does not mold around your body.  Also it was hard to move when you want to switch positions while sleeping.,1
Cuddledry Cuddlemat Amazing Color Changing Bathmat for 0 to 30 Months Baby (Green),"It really does work, but the towel itself is not that big or gorgeous. Plus mine had a light coloured line through it, seems to be a permanent thing, not good enough.",3
Tuscany 6 Piece Crib Bedding Set,The Tuscany bedding set is beautiful. I love the color combinations. The bedding set looks great in our son's nursery.,5
"Britax Marathon 70-G3 Convertible Car Seat, Onyx",Love this car seat!  Very easy to adjust and make comfortable for my daughter.  Very sturdy pproduct will last my daughter for several years.,5
"Pearhead Lil' Peach Babybook, Bird",Delivered in good time and very nicely  packaged.  Daughter was thrilled....spaces for keepsakes and family info that will last forever.  nice for baby boy,5
"Boppy Newborn Lounger, Geo",I was told this was an essential item for a newborn. I agree this is an excellent product and easy to move around the house.,5
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow","They sent me the wrong color, not the one I ordered. I ordered green/yellow and they sent the ecru one, which I already have.I'm not sure if it's worth returning it for only 6 $.Probably I'm going to keep it but I'm really dissapointed.You can always buy these from Babies R Us for the same price and at least you get what you want for sure.",1
DEX Products Baby Wipes Warmer,"I did not register for this item but got it as a gift from another mom that also loved it.  I didn't really like it at first, but I had not read the directions and didn't add water.  I found that when using Pampers wipes, even with adding water, they dry out on the top.  They're just too thin.  I bought the Huggies wipes and I now love this warmer.  I have never even had to add water with these wipes.",5
"Skip Hop Studio Diaper Bag, Black Dot","I cannot say enough good things about this bag. I never dreamed one bag could fit everything we needed for the twins, but this one does. It has tons of pockets that are all the right sizes and in all the right places. the charcoal/silver color is great because it's neutral so it always goes with what you are wearing and doesn't show dirt. You can't go wrong with this bag!",5
"Nuby Step Stool, Colors May Vary",This is perfect for little ones to be able to wash hands and use the potty plus just sit on when they want.  We have even used it a time or 2 ourselves,5
"BABYBJORN Soft Bib, Red","This might be one of my best purchases.  I actually got it so I would qualify for free shipping, never expecting this bib would be such a lifesaver.  The concept is pretty straightforward, and it works just like you would expect.  It catches all the stuff that doesn't quite make it from the highchair tray into the mouth, and it is fantastic for the early stages of learning to use a sippy cup.  This bib saves me from having to either let my baby eat naked or change her outfit after every meal.It's also great that you just wash the bib off in the sink, and it's ready to be used again right away.  No waiting for the washer/dryer.  I'm ordering an extra for use at grandma's house.",5
Skip Hop Zoo Backpack and Lunchie-Ladybug,It's a great little back pack and lunch bag combo my daughter loves to carry to day care every day,5
"American Baby Company Cotton Terry Contoured Changing Table Cover, Maize",I was a little disappointed when I recieved this RED bumper pad and found that the strings to tie it to the crib were WHITE. I thought I was buying a solid red pad. It looks pretty tacky in my opinion. Other than that it was fine.,3
"MAM Night Glow in the Dark Silicone Pacifier, Blue, 6 Plus Months, 2-Count","My kid has an obsession with pacifiers- will only use mams. If we try others, he freaks out. I like them too. He loves the novelty of the glow in dark.",5
"LA Baby 2&quot; Compact Crib Mattress, White","A new grandbaby meant updating the old but sturdy porta-crib I originally used with my children. Following the manufacturer's original safety specifications, I needed a new 2"" crib mattress.  Baby equipment has changed alot over the years, and I was a bit apprehensive about finding a good quality mattress with the exact length, width, and depth needed to safely update the old porta-crib. This purchase met all the specs! Upon arrival, it proved to be exactly as described, well made, and durable.  I am very pleased with this purchase, and my first grandchild is enjoying her naps as safely as her mother did when she was an infant! I loved my porta-crib when it was new and my babies were tiny - I love it more today for both its ties to the past and the precious cargo it now holds...it's good to know that some manufacturers don't require you to toss the old in favor of all things new!",5
BRICA Roll 'n Go Car Seat Transporter,"I knew when my granddaughter was going to travel , that rental car seat was not even thought of. This product is so so wonderful I wish that I had one when my 5 children where babies! I am so glad amazon offers these products to families so travel is less stress!!!! THANK YOU!",5
"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso","This crib worked out great for us. It arrived quickly and I was able to put it together with minimal help from the hubby :) It looks nice when built up and my toddler has been very content in it from the start - he only started using it at 1 year old. My only recommendations are to get some of bumper for the inside as my little one rolls around A LOT and end up on the bars. Also, to get some kind of rail covers as the first thing he did was started chewing on the rails!",4
"The First Years Jet Stroller, Red/Black","This stroller is lightweight, sturdy and does its job.  My only complaint is that folding it with the hinge at the bottom back is a little harder than I'd like and I wish it could be done with the foot.",4
Kimberly Grant Spa Baby Diaper Stacker,Purchased the diaper caddy for my 2 yr old son when we were redecorating his room. He loves the colors & I love how useful it is to me. Received it in the mail rather quickly! Wonderful purchasing experience. Definitely would pirchase from seller again & recommend!,5
Baby Brezza Formula Pro One Step Food Maker,"My husband bought this for our twin newborns. They take expressed breastmilk during the day and formula at night. He thought it would save time, and it did....but, I don't think it mixed at the correct ratio. We used the correct disc that is recommended in the manual for the formula type. If I asked it to make a 4 oz bottle, it would give me 6 oz. My husband said it is because it was dispensing 4 oz of water and the addition of powder was making more formula. When I hand mix bottles by putting the water in first, then the powder, I do not end up with 2 additional ounces of formula. After 2 months the lights went crazy on it. There were either no formula amount indicator lights or every one was lit up and you never knew what the machine was set on. We were able to return the machine for a refund. Thank goodness I kept the box. Now that I am hand mixing, the babies are taking less formula, which leads me further in believing that the machine was mixing it incorrectly. It is also hard to clean. We had to clean mold out of the water tank on a regular basis, and the tank frequently smelled like burnt rubber (we assumed from the gaskets overheating).",2
"Zoli Baby Bot XL Straw Sippy Cup 9 oz - 2 Pack, Green/Pink","While these cups are pricey, they are totally worth it! My son can flip these cups any which way he wants and the straw still works!There is a bit of leakage with this cup, mostly it can be stopped by making sure the kid is flush and securely tightened, and by clearing the top of the straw.I love these cups, and am so glad they were recommended to me!",5
Trend Lab Terry Infant Robe in Blue,I bought two of these for my twin girls who are 2 1/2 months old. They are super cute! My only issue is that the material is a bit rough on the skin. I would have given this item 5 stars if the robes would have been softer.,3
"NUK Active Silicone Spout Learning Cup, Ladybug, 10-Ounce","Idea and design are good but my 18 month old can't get any water out of the firm plastic top.  I even tried and it would take an industrial vacuum to suck liquid out.  Very disappointed, especially given the other good reviews.",2
Wide Neck Baby Bottle 10 Oz. 1 Bottle,I switched my son from Avent to these bottles because of the BPA issue.  He adjusted within 2 days and now LOVES them.  They work great.  I have had no problems with the nipples.  They are really cute too and are different from anyone elses at daycare.,5
Piyo Piyo Yellow Baby Nail Scissors,Using it for my 6 month old baby's nails. Like the curvy shape and the fact that it is rounded at the top. I highly recommend it.,5
Hudson Baby Elephant Applique Fleece Blanket,"Snuggly soft! Survived a few washings so far with my new niece. I am very happy, especially for the price.",5
Lil Rinser Splashguard in Purple,16 month old recently decided she hated getting water in her face. This works great for keeping water/shampoo off her face in the tub. Took a couple of practice runs for her to get used to it.,5
Medela Tubing For Pump In Style Advanced Breast Pumps #8007214,"Arrived fast & sealed in a plastic, never been opened bag, with all the Medela stickers on it. Brand new. Very very very happy. Recommend.",5
"OXO Tot Fork and Spoon Set, Green","These are awesome, highly recommend for your little people. Quality made and they are made specifically to help your little ones keep the food on the silverware better. I'm probably going to order another set I love them so much!",5
"Summer Infant Metal Expansion Gate, 6 Foot Wide Walk-Thru","We used this gate outside, top of stairs, to keep dogs contained. Works well for keeping them in yard, however, I don't believe it was made to be used outdoors. If you have an outdoor area that is covered, would be great. I love the walk through gate. Easy to open and close.",3
Playtex Fridge-To-Go Bottle Holder - Double,"I breastfeed exclusively and I always had such a hard time leaving the house with a bottle of breast milk along with the capability of making another bottle. I would put the bottle in a large cup with lid filled with ice. Then I would put my breast pump in a large zip lock bag with ice so I could keep using it and carry a spare bottle to fill. Each of those items were prone to spilling so I couldn't even put them in the diaper bag. When you go on long drives pumping is the only efficient way to feed a baby. Making a stop to feed is so time consuming, but I can pump while my husband or mother is driving and I can sit in the back seat and feed the bottle while someone is driving. This Playtex case is the perfect solution. I can fit two CLASSIC GLASS NURSER EVENFLO Size: 3X4 OZ and myLansinoh Manual Breast Pump, 1-Count(not attached to the bottle) plus there is a zipper section in front for extra nipples, a pacifier, teething ring, etc... This pack keeps everything cold for a long time. I know it works for six hours and it was still very cold. It also provides a tight fit for my glass bottles so I don't have to worry about them banging around. It doesn't take up a lot of space in the feezer.",5
"Edushape 7&quot; See Me Sensory Ball, Colors May Vary",My daughter plays with these a lot while in daycare.  So we bought them for her to play at home.  We bought both the small and large size balls.  The balls are a soft flexible plastic material.  The spikes are perfect for teething and the texture helps her grab and hold on to the ball.  They're easy to push and she smacks them around and crawls behind it to do it all over again.  I gave it a 4 because the material is really soft and they deflate quicker than expected.,4
BuggyBagg Shopping Cart Cover - Single Pattern: Jungle,"I looked at several buggy covers in various price ranges.  This one was definitely worth the extra money!  It is so easy to put on.  Unlike all the others, it zippers up simply for storage and comes with its own straps so you don't have to put those yucky store ones on your baby.  The big fluffy pillow is perfect for those babies that are still wobbly but sitting up.  The colors are bright and fun for baby to look at.  All the extra compartments make this into a diaper bag if needed.  I love how much cushion is all around. It really makes baby comfortable.  So nice, even sleeping in it is easy.  I've used it in a shopping cart and on a restaurant highchair and both went on with easy.",5
Fisher-Price Private Connection Monitor with Dual Receivers - White and Grey,"I bought this monitor b/c i wanted dual receivers and it advertised a long range. The instructions inside said 400ft range however the box boasts a 900 ft range. Confusing? I can tell you that the signal is fuzzy when I'm in my driveway...directly under the baby's room! Also the battery is terrible. I can charge the battery for 8-10, use it the next day turning it on only during the baby's nap and the battery is dead by the end of the day. Finally, there is no power indicator light. You have no idea, in the dark of night or from across the room whether or not the receiver is on. I will be returning this monitor.",2
"Luvable Friends 6 Pack Washcloths, Blue","We use cloth diapers and these make great cloth wopes. They have stood up many, many washings and are still soft and grippy. Can't beat them for the price.",5
DaVinci Full/Twin Size Conversion Rail Kit - Natural,"I was thinking I would have to go purchase slats after reading some of the reviews on here, however, the rails have the normal standard lip you expect on rails and then there is a piece of wood attached that hangs over far enough that the boxsprings will not fall through...SO, you do NOT need slats!!The hardware that came with it was EXACTLY what was needed and it went together in a few minutes! (note: they use the SAME bolts and barrel locks as the mini crib so if you lose something you already have it.My 2yr old LOVES his new ""big boy"" bed!!It is also VERY sturdy! I sat on his bed last night as he went to sleep in his new bed for the first time and there were no creaks etc.!",5
"J.L. Childress 6 Bottle Cooler Tote Bag, Blue/Green","does its job.  Once he's on solids, I look forward to using the upper compartment.  I just wish it had two zippers because I'm always fumbling to see where the zipper is on this thing.",4
Motorola Additional Camera for Motorola MBP33 Baby Monitor,"Great night vision. We spent a little more to get the one that zooms and pans. Glad we did. Overall great product. It does not come with a clip, which makes it hard when walking around the house, outside or doing chores.",5
"GRACO Backless TurboBooster Car Seat, Groovy","Very well made and sturdy.  Boosts my little one perfectly and it's very very easy to put her in it.  I was looking for something to replace the ""big"" seat she had and this one looked good, especially with the ability to choose a design.  The only drawback is that I had to add extra padding because it wasn't as comfortable as her ""big"" seat.  Now, with the extra pad, it's absolutely perfect!",4
"Jaq Jaq Bird Chalk Mat, Roadway","This Chalk Mat is the perfect solution for a child in a restaurant!  It's easy to tote, as it rolls up, and doesn't take up much space.  There's a little pocket on the mat for storing chalk, so you don't have to worry about it getting loose in your purse or diaper bag.  I am so glad I bought this because my husband and I no longer have to worry about going out to eat with our son, and only getting our appetizer before there's a tantrum! The owl pattern is very cute as well! Great for ages 1 and up!",5
"Safety 1 Clic Infant Car Seat Carrier, Black","We bought this just so we could have something for the car seat - we have 2 jogging strollers so did not need the stroller that the car seat clicks onto.  We have the Safety 1st Onboard 35 - which we love.  This is lightweight, folds up small, and is easy to use and store.  It also has a sunshade that comes in really handy, as well as the 2 cup holders and storage area below.  Didn't think we would use it that much - but we really have!  We do live in a mountainous area - with dirt streets - which this is horrible on (hence the need for jogging strollers).",5
Baby Bots Changing Pad Cover,One more item for my grandson's robot nursery. It is so cute like I am sure he will be! He's due Jan1st,5
"Munchkin Click Lock Re-usable Sippy Cups, 10 Ounce, 8-Count","these are thicker than the take and toss cups, and the click lock is much nicer than having a kid pull  off the lid- which mine were starting to do. less mess with these and at about $1 a cup its not as big of a deal if they are forgotten and left somewhere. i was tired of losing me $5 a cup sippy cups.only problem is that after a month or so of use my daugter couldnt get anything out of it but i just took a needle and stuck through all the holes and problem solved.",4
"Eddie Bauer Backpack Harness, Black",Got this for our son with autism for when we went to the zoo.  It kept him within reach and out for trouble.  Highly recommend this item.,5
"Kate Aspen Be Seeing You Luggage Tag, Owl",The gift recipient was delighted with this owl luggage tag.  It was just as the seller described the item & I would recommend it as long as you are interested in owls.,4
"Mumi&amp;Bubi Solids Starter Kit, 42 x 1oz Cubes In Two Compact Baby Food Freezer Storage Trays, Plus Free e-Recipes","I LOVE these trays! They are perfect for making homemade baby food! We initially wanted to nix plastic & use stainless steel ice cube trays, but after seeing the price of one, we decided we would try this set of two for the same price instead and see how they worked out. This came as a set of two trays with lids: 21 one-ounce cubes per tray. They stack wonderfully, wash easily, & I haven't had one become odorous, mstain or discolor yet..even with beets or tomatoes! I will agree, however, with other reviewers that the cubes do not pop out easily upon initially removing them from the freezer. We simply just take them out of the freezer and either let them sit on the counter for 5 minutes or quickly dip the underside of the trays in some lukewarm water just long enough to loosen the cubes. Then they easily slide right out! Great product!",5
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Select-a-Show Soother,"This thing is so stinkin cute! I got it for my nephews 1st birthday and what a hit! My 9 month old loves it as well! I will probably buy another! It got here a week early and was perfect! This is a must have, its cute and the sounds/music arent loud and annoying every parents dream!",5
WubbaNub Yellow Duck,"I bought this for my 3 month old because I had heard great things about it from some friends. It's cute and soft and he can hold onto it, so the pacifier at least stays closer to his mouth. We have been using Nuk pacifiers, which he likes well enough and are a very different shape from the attached Soothie. If the company gave a choice of different style pacifiers, I think the product would be AWESOME. I guess it will just take some getting used to, but I think it's also a great tool for babies to figure out how to put things in their mouths. I would recommend it to a friend, especially if you're already using the Soothies.",4
FunBites Hearts - Cuts kids' food into fun-shaped bite-sized pieces . . . Great for picky eaters and bento!,"Love FunBites! My 7yr old and 4 yr old had so much fun making their own funbites! Perfect for picky eaters!Pros: Fun and easy for kids to use, creative way to get picky eaters to eat, fun shapes, good treat for special events, multi uses from food to snacks to bite size cookies, Sturdy construction, friendly customer service and different shapes to choose from.Cons: Not really a con, but I would love to see some shapes a little larger to make mini sandwiches that are a little bigger that would be perfect for lunches!",5
"Room Magic Magic Desk Hutch, Chocolate","My only problem with this was that the brackets, pictured in the instructions.  That attach the hutch to the desk were not there or in the package.",4
Baby Jogger Adjustable Belly Bar,"I have 15 month old twins, with the belly bar on, I adjusted the straps to just go across their thighs and between the crotch. they lean forward and hold the belly bar on walks. They love it, they seem to feel less restricted than being all strapped down. Of course I watch that they don't try to climb out but they are pretty content. I like the fact that it adjusts too, and it seems pretty sturdy.",5
Matte Satin Bib with Screened Cross (One Size/White),"Had this nice bib monogrammed for our grandsons baptism. Good quality, nice fabric.  The cross makes this bib very special.",5
"Fresh Baby So Easy Portion Storage Bags, 50 Count",These bags fit nicely in my side-by-side freezer. They take up much less space than a traditional freezer bag so I can fit more in a small space.  I like to keep homemade soup around for quick lunches and these are the perfect size for my family.,5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"My son and daughter-in-law requested this item and they are very pleased with it.  For their last child they used another brand, and  were dissatisfied.  However, they love the Diaper Champ.",4
Burlington Baby Bassinet Combo with Wicker Baskets,"For the price this is the best bassinet I could find.  I am very pleased with this bassinet.  It is easy to assemble taking less than 10 minutes.  The parts are plastic, but feel very durable.  The baskets on the bottom are a nice touch.  It comes with everything you need to set up a for a boy or girl.  It has a pad in the bassinet.  You can adjust the wheels to make it a cradle.Overall 5 stars!  Thank you!",5
Fitted Portable Crib Sheet in Yellow Duck Print,It fits the 6 inch portable crib mattress perfectly but it is not top quality sheets. After a few washes it will shrink.,3
Chicco Lil Piano Splash Walker,"This walker is easy to put together and is well made. My 6 mo. old grandson fits in it well with the walker on the lowest setting. The walker collapses flat for easy storage. The play console installs easily and takes regular batteries for the sound/light effects. Replacing the batteries should be easy and inexpensive to do. The console also snaps out easily, providing a tray for snacks, etc. The low profile of the play console allows the baby to have an unobstructed view of the room while scooting around. My grandson plays with the toys, but prefers scooting around. I think this walker will hold up sufficiently so that it can be handed down to another child.",5
Munchkin Dora the Explorer Bath Squirters,was a great christmnas girt for a dora fan arrived just in time for the holidays dispite weather and buisiness we love them and worked great to take the place of our older ones. they are kind of small t=but we like them and are happy with them and how quickly they came.,5
"Baby K'tan Breeze Baby Carrier, White, Large",I really like this carrier. It is the third one I've tried. It is very comfortable and lightweight which makes it perfect for summer. It does not hurt my back like another carrier I've tried. You can customize how its positioned easier than the more expensive carriers with buckle and straps which is why i think my back hurts less. My boyfriend thinks I'm going to drop our baby with this but it is very secure. It does move at little sometimes in some positions which is why I gave it four stars instead of five.,4
JollyPop Pacifiers PREEMIE PREMATURE BABY'S Size Pink Natural Scent,This is listed as preemie which is why I ordered it but IT IS NOT.  The package even reads 0-3 months so I don't know why it's listed under preemie.,1
Cybex 2.GO Baby Carrier - Chilli Pepper,"Here is why, 5 positions, padded seat for a child, a baby sits on his bottom on Cybex while on other carriers he sits on his crotch. That's why I returned them and kept Cybex. The head support for facing a mother position and if you want to place a baby to face out then just fold that pad down. Easy to put the baby in. The carrier expands as the baby grows by unzipping the zipper in the middle.  This Carrier is made for a baby's and a parent's comfort. The padded straps and support on the lower back and shoulders spread the weight so well you even don't feel it! Finally I can carry my son in a properly made carrier. I used others and mu child screamed in them. Then I made a research and top nine carriers included Cybex. There was  Trekker in the article too, but it is shipped from Canada so I hesitated to order Trekker because of their return policy. Try Cybex carrier and you will keep it as I did.",5
"Bibbitec Ultimate Bib Junior, 9 Months - 2 Years (Moonbeam Gray - Pink Trim)","This is perfect for my 10-month-old granddaughter who has problems with spitting up her food.  We saw this on Shark Tank and decided to give it a try, and her mom is thrilled!  Easy to clean and fits perfectly.",5
"Spill Spoiler Cap, Red/Green/Royal Blue, 3-Count",My son is low weight and the doctor has suggested Pediasure to increase his caloric intake.  These work perfectly with Pediasure bottles.  So much easier than constantly transferring into sippy cups.  The only hard part is keeping up with them.  We sometimes forget to take them off of bottles or leave them in random places.,5
"SpaSilk Washcloths, Blue, 0-36 Months, 10-Count","These washcloths are very good for babies and soft skin. For a newborn, they can be used as quick burp cloths, sponges for little baths and cleanups, and as washable baby wipes.They're very soft, and they stay fairly white over time, but the one negative is that the edges seem to curl very easily when the washcloths are dried; you can flatten them out by hand, then fold them, and they'll stay flat for a little while, but the next time they're dried, they'll curl up again. If you air dry them, they don't curl as much, but it's still an annoyance.Since all the other washcloths I've used (generic brands, mostly) have the same problem, to a greater or lesser extent, it's not a big deal. You can't really have enough washcloths for a newborn baby!",4
"Baby Jogger F.I.T. Single Jogging Stroller, Slate/Black","We received the FIT as a gift from family after our baby was born. We wanted the opportunity to go for a jog together and this allowed us to do so. We did also order the Chicco carseat adapter for it as our baby is still an infant. Once that got installed we were off and running! The stroller is extremely sturdy. I was trying to decide between the BOB and Baby Jogger. This was recommended by many and the price was much more reasonable than BOB. I do not regret it at all. I typically go for the brand and don't mind as much about price, but in this situation, I really feel like I got an outstanding stroller for half the price. The wheels are very sturdy, the shade is large and definitely keeps the sun off baby, and it moves like a dream. It truly is a one-fold design. Although bulky (all jogging strollers are), it's easy to fold up and store. My only ""complaint"" is the fact that the front wheel doesn't swivel so making turns is a tiny bit awkward. You'll figure out how to manage it though. In no way is that a deal breaker.I'd recommend it to all my mommy friends who are in the market for a jogging stroller. We use an umbrella stroller for more of the everyday stuff, but this is perfect for an active family.",5
"TL Care Organic Cotton Mittens, Natural, 0-3 Months","keeps falling off of new borns. a little too big, may be good for 3-6 month olds.... .. .. ..",2
DaVinci Sleepwell Twilight 6-Inch Ultra Firm Deluxe Crib Mattress,"It says this was the mattress I ordered (buy the Davinci crib, get this mattress with it free). However, I opened the package and aired it out in the garage without thinking. A couple months later when we were ready for the baby to sleep in it I looked and realized the mattress shown is NOT what we ordered. This one says 100% polyster. However, I got one that is 100% vinyl cover (which is being phased out due to being unsafe, leaching chemicals!)",1
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","Where to start? Not much to say since it's a trash can! The construction is a medium level plastic, which is good weight wise but a downfall in the opening mechanism department.While at work this arrived and my wife put it together. I arrived later to find her fidgeting with it for a few hours, wondering my the step on the bottom would keep losing its 'keep' with the spring like tension to open the top.  When you open it up you'll notice two rod like pieces that must seat correctly to enable the top opening correctly. They occasionally jump track and you have to open it to correct the error. The catch on the upper rod, is just a bad design. Not a deal killer, but could benefit from a more competent engineer CADing another piece entirely.However that said, this thing is a dream. Holds a lot of diapers and the zero smell. The bagging system is awesome too. I would recommend this to anyone on the fence about it.",4
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Jumperoo,"my 5 month old loves this jumperoo, the lights and songs encourage him to jump because they light up and make sounds each time he jumps and interacts with the toys! Now he is the little master of the jumperoo and doesn't want to stop jumping! Definitely one of the better jumperoos out there! I totally recommend this! :)",5
KidCo F800 Baby Food Maker and Mill - Includes Tote - Make healthy baby food!,"The picture shows a metal grate, but when the grinder arrived, the grate was white plastic and kind of flimsy. Definitely a disappointment. Also, the seal is too tight, making it really hard to push down. This may improve with use, but right now it's not at all easy to use. If I could do it over, I would buy a different product.",2
"Planet Wise Reusable Diaper Pail Liner, Avocado","This diaper pail liner is sturdy and stays on my pail very well.I have no complaints so far, and have been using it for a month now.",5
"Kid'Sleep Classic, Blue","We bought this for my daughter when we made the transition to her &#34;big girl bed&#34;. I have to say, it has saved my sanity (and my sleep!). She now knows that she can not get out of bed until the cow wakes up. This has been especially wonderful with the time change- we just set the morning time 15 min later each day for the week before the change. No getting up at 6am for mommy! I think it's totally overpriced, but worth it- my daugher loves it!",5
"DaVinci Richmond Changer Chest, Cherry","I bought two of these to use as night stands and I love them. The quality is better than I expected - good quality wood and good finish on all of the parts you see from the front (back panel is composite and the drawer wood is unfinished and the bottoms are a bit flimsy, but still very functional and about what I would expect for this price). Other reviews mentioned that the drawers were small, and that it scratched easy - I thought the drawers were fine for what I wanted it for and I haven't had any scratching issues. As for other reviews about the drawers falling apart or not sliding right, see below.I would have given this 5 stars if not for two things:1: I had to exchange one because all three drawer bottoms were broke in half (looked like a shipping problem, but why is it packed with the flimsiest piece unprotected on the outer part of the box??) That was a hassle and made me nervous about the product, but Amazon was great and replaced it quickly and the two I ended up with had no scratches or problems.2: The directions were not entirely right and there was some difficulty with building it. The pictures of the drawer slides were backwards/upside down for where they are actually supposed to go. If you've never built anything with drawer slides, that could be confusing (could also be why some say they have problems with their drawers??). The hardware itself is lightly stamped with ""R"" and ""L"" indicators, so if you buy one, use those as a guide instead of the paper printed instruction pictures. Also, the back panel did not simply screw in (the rest of the building was very simple and all the holes and screws matched up great) and I had to use a drill to pre-make the 12 or so holes to screw them into. All in all, not a big deal, but it did take longer to build them then I expected.Overall, I would recommend it highly and I would buy more of them if I had a place for them. This is a great piece, especially for the price.",4
DEX Products Sound Sleeper SS-01,"I had read the reviews for this noisemaker, and had heard that somepeople had complained the volume was too soft - however, there seemed to be enough reviews to the contrary to give me the confidence to buy this.I can not stress this enough.  This. product. is. barely. audible.On it's highest volume, it's practically useless.I will be returning this immediately.",1
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","As grandparents, we bought this for use at our home for our 12 month old grandson who we see almost daily. It is very simple to put together and is very secure. It seats him at just the right height and the adjustments avaIlable will enable use for well into the future. We strap it to a chair which is dedicated for his use and can even use it to seat him at the piano to tinkle the keys as well as to cut his hair. Well made, portable and excellent value for money.",5
Beco Gemini Baby Carrier - Paige,"Very useful, excellent for all ages (due to the option of using it by carring the child on the back once he/she are to heavy to carry up front). The only issue I have with this is that when carring the baby face forward the baby tends to mouth the front panel. Unfortunatly, protective inserts are sold only for the side straps and nothing for the front panel. With that in mind, this is a tiny issue and not a real problem.",4
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle",I bought this as a gift for my friend.She loves it!It is really lovely and I even want to keep it for myself:P,5
"Sassy 2 Count Grow Up Cup, Purple/Orange, 9 Ounce","I bought these cups on a whim and I LOVE them!  They don't leak, easy to suck out of, and our dishwasher safe!! I think for my next kid I will purchase the earlier cups too and use only these!",5
Odorless Diaper Pail by Safety 1st,"We purchased this diaper pail with our first son.  We put all poopy diapers in baggies and tie them shut before placing them in the pail, and under normal circumstances would empty it once a week without a smell in the nursury.We're going on our second baby and I was wondering if the deoderizing part of this can be replaced at all.  I haven't seen them sold anywhere.",4
"Graco SnugRide Classic Connect 30/35 Infant Car Seat Base, Silver","Well, you bought a Graco Infant car seat, then you should have one base for each car. Just to make things easier..But, if there is a next time for me, I'd not buy a Graco Infant Car Seat. The one I bought was made of velvet and my baby felt it was too warm.And the Infant Car Seat is hard to click connect. I had one from a diferent brand before and it was much easier..",3

"Fisher-Price Potty Training, Learn-to-Flush","When it's used, the potty plays music. It shorted out after a few uses. The flusher still works. My DD uses it. It's good, but not great.",3
"Bright Start Full Size Swing, Up Up &amp; Away","(DISCLOSURE: I received a free Bright Starts Up, Up & Away Plug In Sway & Swing to try and review.  My opinions are my own.)This is a decent swing.  It gives us a place to put the baby when we need to get some things done around the house.  My 5-month-old daughter enjoys sitting in it and she likes to reach up at the toys in the mobile.  We like to keep it in the kitchen, so the baby can sit and play while we eat or cook.  The swing plays nice music and I like that it sways side to side.  My daughter seems to prefer that over the swinging back and forth.The swing does have its pros and cons.  The biggest problem was the assembly.  It was somewhat difficult, with some pieces not lining up.  I had to force some pieces together.  But, once it was put together, we've been pretty pleased with it.One thing to keep in mind is this swing is huge!  It has a very large footprint.  So, if you have a small space, then this swing may not be for you.  It's almost too big for our kitchen and often someone trips over its legs.PROS:* Swings back and forth and sways side to side* Includes an AC adapter, so you save on batteries (big plus!)* Baby can face three different directions* Plays nice music and nature sounds* Lower price point than similar swings* Swing motor is quietCONS:* Difficult to put together* Large footprint* Not as soft or plush as other similar swings* Stationary mobile with hard toysOverall, the swing works well.  If you couldn't afford anything more expensive, this swing would be fine to get.",3
Prince Lionheart Original Slumber Bear with Silkie Blanket - Blue,This device had my child falling asleep after he had woken up in the middle of the night- because it's sound activated by the babies cries. I know of no other soother that you don't have to get up and turn on. The white noise sounds of the womb comforted my child and it saved me quite a bit of sleep.,5
"Skip Hop Pronto Changing Station, Metro Stripe","I ordered this as a baby shower gift for a friend and was pleased when it arrived.  It appeared to be well made, looked stylish, and will certainly be a handy item for a new mom on the go.",5
Hard Rock Cloth Diaper &amp; Laundry Detergent - Motley Clean,"I live in Northeast Ohio, the water has lots of minerals, so I purchased Hard rock.  This is a great detergent for diapers or regular baby clothes, much better than Dreft. I use it with bumgenius, fuzzibunz, prefolds, and cloth wipes. I wash the diapers twice and use a few scoops with each load and they really come clean.",5
"Gerber Birdseye Diaper Burpcloths, Pink, Girl, 4-Count","They were very thin, was disappointed. I purchased them to make burp cloths so I ended up doubling them and sewing decorative borders all the way around them. They turned out okay except I only got half as many as I thought I would",1

"Lambs &amp; Ivy Bumper, Luv Bugs","We bought most of the ""echanted forest"" series, including the bedding set, hamper and stuffed owl, but the bumper is one of our favorites.

Medela Quick Clean Micro-Steam Bags - 2 Pack,This is very convenient especially when I had to travel between homes during Chinese New Year. It is very common for people to have microwave and I can conveniently steam and clean the bottles and equipment at ease.,5
"PRIMO EuroBath, Pearl White","My Eurobath is the only bathtub I have purchased for my daughter.  We've been using it since she was 2 weeks old, and she is now 15 months old.  The infant side provides good support and I never worried about her slipping.  The toddler side is just big enough for her to play with toys, but not so big that she is slipping and sliding.  My only warning is that it is large.  We store it the children's bathroom tub.",5
Sliding Door Locks,"I saw these at a friend's house and when my baby started opening his closet, I knew I needed to get these.  They work great!  My little one figured out quick that he can't open the door anymore and gave up.  I looked around for the best deal and found them here on Amazon.com.",4
Sugar Booger &quot;Prehistoric Pals&quot; Feeding Collection Silverware Set,"We bought this set after we got tired of using Plastic spoons that probably aren't BPA free and regular silverware wasn't small enough for our baby's mouth. These spoons were not too small and not too big and scoops up a good amount of food for us to feed our little one. The case is a nice touch, love the magnet closure that comes with it.",5
Graco Digital Deluxe iMonitor Baby Monitor,"We are very pleased with this monitor - and yes I believe a monitor is a must-have baby product - you will know right away when your baby cries if you put them down for a nap or down for the night and want to be another room.  The sound quality is good with this device - and we have wireless internet and live in a densely populated neighborhood.  Also, I was pleasantly suprised by the small size of both the sound monitor and the receivers.  The receiver in my kitchen takes up very little counter space, and the monitor is small enough to keep on a window sill.  I appreciate another's reviewer suggestion to get the monitor with 2 receivers (not one) if you live in a 2-story house.  I was going to buy the single receiver model, but I am glad we didn't, as I can keep one receiver upstairs in our bedroom and the other downstairs in our kitchen.  I have often taken one of the receivers outside to do some work in our backyard while our little one naps - and have been able to get work done all the while being able to respond to our baby quickly when he cries.  Overall, great product.",5
Summer Infant Little Looster,"I returned it because it is rather big, so check to see if you have enough space.  Also check the base of your toilet.  Mine was too wide and did not allow a close fit.  Also it gets in the way if an adult wants to use the toilet.  It's awkward and you have to have space to put it when you remove it.",2
Bumkins Waterproof Sleeved Bib - On-The-Go,"At 10 months, my daughter loves eating avocados and oranges :) ... the only problem is that these foods - especially oranges - really stain clothes.  I had to constantly soak every item in hot water, just to get a lighter stain.She hates bibs and would yank and pull them off constantly, so I knew I needed something different.  This sleeved bib has been amazing!  She doesn't mind wearing it all, it fits her great (with room to grow) and her clothes have stayed stain free.  The bib is very easy to clean.  It says it's machine washable, but I just wash it in the sink after each meal with a bit of dish soap and warm water and let it sit in the dishwasher to dry until the next meal time.  This bird design is really cute too!I definitely recommend these bibs and only wish I'd bought them sooner.",5
Lamaze Soft Chime Garden Musical Toy,"While I'm certain that this toy is wonderful for infants, we have found that it is also wonderful for our 3 year old daughter with Atypical Rett Syndrome.  It is soft, brightly colored, very easy to activate (only requires a light tap), and the music it plays is pleasing to the ear.  Definitely recommended.",5
Hohner / 8&quot; Toddler Rainmaker,Great toy for 9 months and up.  Once they can hold it in their hand and twist on their own.  The adults liked it as well!,5
Wrap Strap Shopping Cart Safety Strap,It works great.  I love not needing to count on the strap that is on the cart to be big enough or clean enough for my child.,5
Baby Einstein Lights and Melodies Discovery Phone,"I should've read the reviews before I purchase this product.  The sound is too low and you can barely hear it.  My son shows no interest in this toy after 30 seconds.  Don't waste your money on this, find something else!",1
"Carter's Easy Fit Printed Crib Fitted Sheet, Animal",This crib sheet is great- good quality and is lasting through many tough washings. I bought it for my daughter since we have so many boy themed sheets. My only issue is that I bought two- different patterns from the same listing but one order got canceled.,5
"Cosco Juvenile Funsport Play Yard, Kontiki",I would recommend this play yard. It was easy to use. The directions are right on it. My little girl did just fine in it.,5
"Delta Universal 6 Drawer Dresser, Black Cherry","I was looking for a dresser, not specifically one for a nursery as I dont have kids but this dresser is similar sized to other ""adult"" dressers...so I can't speak about its merits in a nursery but from what I can tell, its a great dresser period.Flat pack furniture is normally particle board and other laminated garbage. This piece is 99% solid wood. Drawer bottoms and the back cover are particle board/cardboard but its acceptable as each drawer has a solid wood support going down the middle. Its very sturdy, pretty tall and looks great in espresso (also cheaper in that color too). The drawers are on metal rails w/ wheels, no cheap plastic, and slide great. Anyone looking for a well built dresser should look no further. Compared to other ~$200 dressers, this is MUCH better and should last MUCH longer.I've never been impressed with flat-pack furniture until this. Completely excellent. Great for anyone looking for a good dresser.To top it off, assembly was not complicated, time consuming but not complicated. Directions are pretty easy to follow and everything fits perfectly.For what its worth. This product would be immensely more popular if it wasnt in the ""baby"" section of amazon. This is a quality piece of furniture.",5
"Munchkin Mighty Grip Flip Straw Cups 2-Pack, 10- Ounce (Colors Vary)","I have both the Combi Mug Step 3 and the Munchkin Mighty Grip Flip Straw Sippy. My 18-month-old only drinks from the Munchkin. I much prefer the Munchkin because it's easier to wash (I used my Dr. Brown tiny brush to clean the straw). Other than the straw the Munchkin does not have soft rubber parts where mold grows, like the Combi does. It takes more effort to suck as other reviewers indicated, but my kid is fine with it. In fact he gets excited when after Mommy takes a big sip the cup makes a sound (air going through the valve.) I used that trick often to get him to drink water. I haven't encounter the problem of leaking in my Munchkin.",5
ReSqueeze Reusable Food Pouch (4-pack),Save me money.... my son 1 years old love his yogurt and he's always on the move that he learn to walk...so now I just buy the larger container of yogurt (cheaper than the small cups and factory pouches of yogurts) fill these reusable pouches and give it to him rather then spoon feed him out of the cup. I find useing the baby bottle brushes as the best was to clean these,5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","The versatility of this toy makes it a lot of fun. The kids really get a kick out of the piano. When they start sitting up, they can play the piano with their hands (not like a real piano of course, the ""keys"" are pretty large). Great idea for a toy, and it's lasted through two kids.",5
Diaper Dekor Plus Diaper Disposal System,"I'll say one good thing about this product: it's easy to use. For a while it seemed to control odor fairly well, but as my daughter got older and her waste got smellier, the Diaper Dekor showed its weakness. Her whole room smells like an outhouse. I've had enough, and am moving on to another product.",1
"Skip Hop Duo Deluxe, Black","It is practical, comfortable and durable. Quality is optimal. long time that I have the product and I have no complaints except for the size which can be small for more than one child.",4
Custom Baby Girl Boutique - Safari 13 PCS Crib Bedding,"This set is awesome. I got it early even with my monogrammed pillow. I really like that the two pillow cases are removable to wash. The purple is a nice true shade, the zebra stripes are chocolate brown though-not black-but I love it. There were a few loose strings in the stitching but a few quick snips with scissors fixed that. I washed it before I put it on and it didn't fade at all. The diaper holder is a little small though. I wanted this but it originally out of stock when i tried to order it so I go the Cocalo Jacana set instead but this came back in stock so I quickly returned that and got this! If you are interested in the Jacana set I would go with this one! The Jacana set is not really purple it's more pinkish and it's very lightly colored, this one is very vibrant with a true purple and you get way more for your money. Plus, you can monogram a the square pillow for free! A great buy!",5
"Munchkin Steam Guard Microwave Sterilizer Bags, 6 Pack, White","In theory, this works great for sanitizing your pump parts, however, it fried my tubing. I followed the instructions but it still fried my tubing. I'm apprehensive to use it with the rest of my parts.",3
"Excellante' Wooden High Chair, Walnut (Packaging May Vary)","Obviously this has not always been the case by the reviews I'm reading, but the current shipments of these high chairs are arriving with the belts stuck to the seat of the chair (the belts were attached and allowed to stick to the lacquer as it dried in manufacture). The quality control on this product is horrendous to have allowed so many units to be affected, but then again, this item is made in China (despite being made of eco-friendly Rubberwood, which is the reason we chose it). Sadly, there is no way for them to send us an unaffected unit at this time, we are really unhappy about this product situation.",1
BabyMoon Pod - For Head Support &amp; Neck Support (Blue),"My baby is starting to have a flat head so this had good reviews. I liked the pictures on the back of the package, which showed proper use. I think it has helped. I like the soft material and the pillow keeps its shape.",4

Tiny Love Tiny Princess Mobile,"Our daughter absolutely adores this mobile!! She coos and smiles at it and gets so excited when we turn it on. We also use the music to soothe her to sleep at night.  We also had a similar one by Tiny Love for our son who is now 15 months old and we still use the  music to soothe him when he is having trouble sleeping, Great purchase!",5
"Regalo Easy Step Extra Wide Walk Thru Gate, White",Overall the gate does what it's supposed to and keeps kids/pets in and out of places. If you need to use the included extenders they aren't flush and tight with the gate and wobble even when pressure mounted to the wall.,3
Mobi Glomate Junior,"I have every kind of tap light for my little one who wakes up and needs a night light. Problem is, they don't auto shut off but this light turns on and goes off after 15 minutes on an internal timer. I have had the same batteries in it for at least a month and haven't had to change them yet! The exterior is smooth plastic but the edges are all round. It's pretty easy to use, but the buttons are on the bottom side and don't light up so its hard to see the power button in the dark. It has been dropped but we have carpet on the floor so I didn't have any issues. It works every night and I never have to change the batteries. We are very happy with the Mobi night light and would recommend it. It's a reliable quality product.",5

Fisher-Price Baby Papasan,"while the seat itself is very attractive i found the belt system to be really weird. the crotch part is nice and wide but super long and elastic which allowed my wiggly son to slide down so far that his ankles were hanging off the edge. i suppose its designed for chubbier babies than my own. on the up side, the vibration and music combo was a big hit me. it folds completely flat and doesnt turn itself off for nearly 20 minutes.",3

Skip Hop Alphabet Zoo Mega Play Mat,"Okay, so I have no one to blame but myself for washing and drying it in my machines. But I have done it before with no issue. This last time, however, the back of the mat actually melted, rendering it useless and I had to throw it away. Until that point, I really liked it.Not sure whether to buy it again and be more careful or just get a new one.Just a word of warning that when it tells you to line dry, you better line dry it!",3
"Carters Wrap Me Up Receiving Blanket, 4 Pack, Green",these are large swaddle blankets 30X40 that can comfortably swaddle your baby and have lasted me till my baby has outgrown it . even after that I have used it as a towel for the belay as it is really soft. highly recommend it.,5

Summer Infant Baby Touch Boost Digital Color Video Monitor,"We had to purchase a the new &#34;Boost&#34; version of this product when our first generation Baby Touch stopped working (just slightly after the 1 year warrantee... great).  This new &#34;version&#34; is terrible.  The screen is more difficult to navigate when switching between multiple cameras and the &#34;touch&#34; is not very sensitive at all.  It's clumsy and annoying.  So, the &#34;improvements&#34; that they have made are not really improvements at all.What's worse is that the previous monitor had fantastic range.  We could use it all over our 3 story house.  This new monitor constantly goes &#34;out of range&#34; when you are not on the actual floor or right below the camera in use.  This renders it pretty much useless.And the seller has been less than helpful with these issues.  I have had to ask Amazon to file a claim to be able to return this ineffective set of cameras/monitors.",1
"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large","I sent this to my 3 year old grandson who loves to push things and ride things around the house.  He can be found pushing it around like a shopping cart, riding it facing forwards or backwards, lying across it, and using it as a chair next to a small table.  He loves it!  My daughter likes it because the wheels go smoothly over carpet, wood and tile surfaces, no scratching.  She says that it is made very well, the material of the seat is soft and easy to wipe clean, and it is not overly large and bulky (can be tucked away in a closet).  My grandson enjoyed his so much that I got a second one (smaller ladybug version) for my 1 year old granddaughter.",5
"Karibu Baby Folding Bath, Blue/White","I got that for my sphynx cat, and we love it!  When we are done it fold and I put way, not taking a lot space !!!",5
"KidKusion Banister Guard, Clear","This product ships with a rolled up piece of clear plastic, some 8-inch white zip ties, a hole punch, and some screws and anchors. You cut the plastic to the size of your railing (they recommend scissors but I used a utility knife to get a straight, smooth cut), punch or drill holes and put screws or zip ties to secure it.The good:fairly easy and simple to installzip ties make installation temporary and generally leave the railing undamaged when you remove it (expect some wear around the zip ties)plastic is clear, so minimal visual impactfeels secure and safeThe bad:zip ties are a little short to get around some banisters, you can link them together to get more length (but then you might need to buy more)plastic is stiff enough to be really annoying trying to get it up against the banister for installation; the plastic keeps wanting to roll back upnoisy when the kid bangs on itplastic can &#34;crease&#34; leaving ugly white marks in the clear film (so be careful not to &#34;fold&#34; the plastic during installation)Overall, this is a satisfying product that makes me feel safe. My older house had the rungs in the upstairs railing too far apart, so this product worked very well to make the railing safe for my infant and toddler. My toddler loves to run up to it and go bang, bang, bang... the first bang always alarms us, but once we realize what he's doing we are confident he's safe. I removed one star just for the difficulty during installation keeping the plastic unrolled and lined up. Careful measurements and good planning will make installation easier and leave you with a good-looking, safe product.",4

"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Kristy","For the price of this carseat I truly was not expecting alot, but I went ahead and purchased it based on the positive reviews.  It does not have a ton of padding, but its roomy and my son seems comfortable in it.  The highsides make it a lil tough for me to lift him up and into it (I drive a full size pickup) so I typically try and find a curb!  =  I think for the price, this is a great purchase.  I would recommend it to a friend.",4
"Snuggin Go Therapeutic Infant Seating Support, Black",This is perfect for my special needs child!  He has transitioned from his infant carseat/stroller to a big boy one.  He has hydrocephalus & lacks head/trunk control still at 1 year old.  This works great in his stroller for additional support!  Wish I would've known about these--and the tortacolis kit--a lot sooner!,5
"Mimijumi 8 Ounce Baby Bottle, Very Hungry","I like that this is simple to wash and it has a nice, wide area for my baby to eat from...but she downs the milk way too fast because there is nothing to slow the flow. I much prefer the Breastflow bottles because they mimic the breast better and slow the flow of milk, so she doesn't spit so much of it back up,",3
Munchie Mug - Top Rated Spill Resistant Snack Cup for Toddlers. Ages 1 to 4 years. Made in AMERICA. - BPA and phthalate free. FDA compliant materials. - Blue Top,"I don't normally write reviews but this is a great item. My 16 month old loves this..she won't even let go sometimes.  its soft cloth cover makes it easy for kids to put their hands inside the cup without hurting themselves (unlike the munchkin one, it is just too hard). Overall, its a great snack cup for home, car, etc.",5
"DK Leigh Crib Nursery Bedding Set, Distinctive Cupcake Baby, 10 Piece",This bedding is better in person. The colors are bold and not pastel like other bedding. I am baker and this was the cutest cupcake bedding I could find. Fabrics are soft too. Looks great with my black crib. Would recommend this item to anyone looking for something girly but NOT PINK! Can't wait to put my baby girl in this crib.,5
"The First Years Compass Pathway B570 Adjustable Booster Seat, Black and Khaki","Update 10-2-10: I use this in my older Audi, which doesn't have latch attachments in the seat. It constantly falls over when I go around a corner. I would recommend keeping the seat belt over it to prevent this from happening.The Pathway B570 is a belt booster. There is no 5-point harness. It does have a pathway for the belt to follow, which makes it easier for my kids to put the seatbelt on. It has removable cup holders, unfortunately, they do not lock in fully, and by that I mean if you turn it half way it stays in, but keep turning and it will unlock. My kids had a bit of trouble with that, and they are easily loosened. The armrests fold up nicely, incase you need a little extra room. This is helpful if an adult will be sitting next to the seat (though it will still be a bit cramped). The color is nice, but it gets hot fast in the sun. The fabric is not that soft and my kids found it less comfortable.....let me mention that I am comparing this to the Britax Frontier. We have one for each child. It is more solid, softer, and has a 5-point harness. For us, the 5-point harness is key, and while the Britax is more than twice the price, I wouldn't trade it for long distance/highway driving. Back to the Pathway.....I use it in my car for when I have to take one of my kids around locally, and it works well. One annoyance, and it goes for any belt booster is when one of my children fall asleep in the car, the belt does not give them the same support that the 5 point harness gives. I try to use this (and our other boosters) strictly for local driving and when I do not think they will fall asleep. The Pathway folds nicely and stays folded, though opening it at first I thought I was going to break it because I had to use a lot of force to open it. Once folded, it is not the easy to carry, and can be a bit awkward. Also, it is heavy. This is not a bad thing, because it is a solid booster.....it just makes it harder to carry around. It fits easily in my trunk, and because it folds, stowing it is simple....in fact, I think it could fit in a plane overhead compartment. This is great if you are traveling and want to bring a good booster with you. Again, the weight is the only issue, as you will have to lug it around the airport if you do not check it. With the cost of renting a car seat from the car rental company's, bringing this along is worth it! Over all, this fits between a regular sit-on type booster seat that has no back, and the full blown, 5-point harness seat. The seat back does extend up to grow with your child. I am happy with this, and if I didn't know about the Britax, I would be thrilled with the Pathway.....I am still happy with it, and believe it does serve a purpose, but I will continue to use it as I have mentioned. I should note that last year I tried a different 5-point harness (I do not remember the brand) and returned it because it was junk, and the only one that met our expectations/standards was the Frontier. Please note this does not take away from the Pathway, I am merely trying to show you my point of reference. For the price, the Pathway has good features and good value.",3
"South Shore Savannah Collection 4-Drawer Chest, White",This is a great sturdy chest! It does come in lots of pieces but it's step by step manual makes it simple to put together! It took us about 45 minutes to assemble! It's made from strong wood and the drawers are spacious! I love it,5

Aqueduck Faucet Handle Extender,"Perfect for my kiddos! This arrived yesterday and the kids love it.Having a step stool next to the sink enabled them to reach the sink basin, but they still couldn't reach the water or faucet. The extender fits tight with a squishy sponge material that grips the handle. A screw piece clamps the two sides together. The screw piece felt a little flimsy so I tightened only until it felt like it wouldn't fall off. I didn't want to over tighten it and break it.I bought this in combination with the faucet extender and now my 2.5 year old is pretty self sufficient in the bathroom.",5
Medela Value Pack Bpa-free Feeding Gift Set : New Wide Base Nipple,"My breast milk is taking a little bit to come in so I have been having to use the Medela bottle set that I bought to go with my breast pump. My daughter now doesn't want to breast feed because it is to easy for her with the nipples on these bottles.  They flow SUPER fast.  So much so that when I lean them down to her mouth they leak on her or her clothing.  We went out tonight and bought the Dr. Brown's bottles because they are listed in """"Parenting"""" magazine as the best newborn bottle for your money.  I will be trying them with her next bottle because these Madela are going in the the local shelter because I can't use them.",1
"Bumble Bags Toddler Car Seat Cover, Starry Sky",ONLY WISH IT HAD A SPACE FOR THE PULL TIGHTENER ON THE GRECO SO IT WOULD BE EASIER TO TIGHTEN STRAPS BUT STILL GREAT.,4
(100-Pack) U-Fill Snack Pack Reusable Refillable Baby Food Pouch,"I love the idea that I can make my own food and put it in an travel pouch. Most of the ones with meat or vegetables are so expensive, this way I know what I am feeding my daughter and It's way cheaper in the long run.",5
"Inglesina Fast Table Chair, Black",We couldn't get our little one to sit in a highchair. He always wanted to be at the table with us like his big brother. We needed something that didn't require a huge overhang and this product works perfectly. We bring it traveling as well. Very easy to fold. And it has great padding! Very comfy for the kids. I've washed the fabric in the washing machine a bunch if times now and always comes out perfect. No shrinking or fading. We use the summer infant tray to catch the food between the table to chair space and it works great. Saw suggestion in another review. The mat doesn't lay perfectly flat but it works and is easy to clean.,5
"NoJo Froggy Friends Musical Mobile, Brown/Green","My 2 month old loves to watch this mobile.  The music is fine, mine has one off key note. The plastic part came a little scuffed up but that gets covered with cloth anyway.  The screw in part to secure it to the bed didn't fit right so I sorta had to jam it in.  I don't move it around so that's not much of a problem once it's in place.  Other than that the mobile is great.  Baby loves it and that's what matters.  Well it's a wind up, so get used to sitting there with baby.",4
"Pearhead Babyprints Keepsake, Year-Round","Like the title says, this item was kind of hard to get a good hand impression on but on the plus side, it was easily moldable so we could try fifty million times if we needed to, lol. It's a foam-type material, which surprised me, and because it was hard to get a good impression, we had to make it thicker, thus unable to use the star shaped mold. I really don't think we could have gotten a good impression by making the foam as thin as needed for the mold.",3
Sassy Crib and Floor Mirror,It's cute and my kid likes it. Just not sure if it's a knock-off...it doesn't look like the picture here on Amazon.com and the bee is upside down...,3
Disney Toy Story Hide and Sneak 4 Piece Toddler Set,"I bought this bedding for my toddler for Christmas, and was fully expecting thin, cheap, uncomfortable material that usually comes from this type of product. Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised. The bedding is actually very soft, even if it is a little thin. The colors are bright and filled with my son's favorite Toy Story characters. As soon as it was on his bed he jumped right in and sat there naming all the characters. The comforter is also reversible, just in case he changes his mind about Buzz and Woody. This bedding is definitely a great buy for little Toy Story fans.",4
"Frenchie Mother Towel, Yellow","OK I LOVE this towel! i only rated it as a 4 because the price is ridiculous! other than that though seriously every mom should have one and the color (Yellow) is super cute as is the binding around the edge (yellow with a brown """"leaf-ish"""" pattern)",4
"Green to Grow Mellow Colic-Relief Wide Neck Baby Bottle, 5 Ounce","These bottles are really cute and seem to be well made. Unfortunately they did not work very well at all for my son. He has more spit up with these. For being a 'wide neck' bottle, they are not very wide at all. I wish the nipple was wider. The nipple is also very fast flowing for a 'slow flow' nipple. My son was very messy while eating from these. The website suggests using a slow flow Nuk nipple, but those were too slow for us. I wish it would have worked out for us, especially after spending so much on this brand.",3
"The Original Woombie Baby Cocoon Swaddle (Big Baby (14-19 lbs), Aqua Stripe)","I'm a keen 1st time Swaddler, as Hospital & Mum showed me, Ive tried all sorts, & as a newborn a cellular blanket was fine, then the Summer 'Swaddle me' was fine till 3 months, then problems started, he was strong enough to break free, & I didn't like the idea of him strapped up for 12 hrs daily! this is not good for his motor & coordination movements etc, I was having a nightmare, adding extra velcro & sewing bits up... Tried the Woombie & he loves it, he now stops the horrid grunting noise that occured while in the velcro swaddle & actually smiles as soon as I zip him into the Woombie. It took a few naps & a night to adjust to the extra bit of freedom, & he can now just reach fingers into his mouth, to self soothe, SO HAVE DITCHED THE DUMMY, HOORAY...SLEEPING THROUGH THE NIGHT EVERY NIGHT SINCE.",5
BEABA First Stage Spoon Multi-Pack - Multicolor - 4 pk,"Yes the silicone does stain eventually, but everything else makes these a keeper.  They are soft and shallow for my beginner eater.  He chews on them when we are done eating.  Have added them to my must have baby gift list.",5

Spectra Baby USA Silicone Massager for Dew 350 and Spectra 9 Breast Pumps,I ordered the massagers even though they were not recommended for Spectra S2 but I was very pleased when I received them along with the pump and they fit perfectly well! So ladies they do work just fine with the Spectra S2 as well :),5
"Medela Contact Nipple Shield, Small",I brought these shields and used it all of 2 times because of sore nipples. But I found hot compresses and the ointment work the best. I haven't used them since and now I don't need them.,2
"Simple Wishes Hands-Free Breastpump Bra, Pink, XS-L","This looks ridiculous, I realize, but after pumping without it for about a week and a half and having to hold the bottles in hand, I recognized the benefits of this bra. Hands free pumping is ideal and so helpful when you have a million other things to do. I would, and have, recommended this to several pregnant friends who plan to breastfeed.",5
OsoCozy Flannel Baby Wipes - 15 pack (White),Great alternative to baby wipes. Eco friendly and safe for baby's skin.  They also wash nicely and are well made.  We have been using them for 4 months without having to replace them and they still look fairly new.,5
"3 Sprouts Wall Organizer, Crocodile","My daughter love love loves flamingos. We hung this at her height and she uses it all the time to put her treasures out of baby brother's reach (in the top pocket, anyway). The lower pockets she puts books and things that he is allowed to share.This is really well made with a heavy canvas and the flamingo itself is darling. I can see it lasting for years to come.",5
"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink",It does what it says it will do.  Holds hot food or cold.  I didn't purchase this for a child but for myself and I'm a 59 year old female.  The led is perfect and not difficult to open.  I have lost some strength in my hands and yet I can open it without a problem.  Who can ask for more!,5

Once I realized that pak n' play mattresses exist I got one right away and ordered the sheets after looking at the reviews. I absolutely love it. It fits tightly, are super soft and there isn't much difference if any after washing and drying. I would recommend these sheets to anyone and will be purchasing more! btw the mattress is a 'Dream on me' 3''.",5
"Kinderglo Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light, Tyrannosaurus","We owned two of the older model (an owl and a t-rex).  The owl is still working, but the t-rex finally went out after two years plus+.  I decided to replace it.  I was pleased when the new one arrived, it was bigger brighter and the charging stand looked better.  However, it would constantly flicker like it was shorting out when on the stand, then wouldn't hold a charge.  Basically you had to leave it on the stand all the time.  The light would be green on the stand, but kind of flickering, undock revealed no charge, re-dock and the light turned red.  I returned it, received a replacement from Amazon, and the replacement has the same issue.  This one is going back for a refund.  Disappointing.  All this circa March - April 2011.",1
BubuBibi Wet/Dry Bag Cloth Diaper/Swim Soft MINKY PINK (21&quot;X14&quot;),"Nice and big enough for my suit, and my kids' suits.  We transport wet things home it this, and then turn the bag inside-out to dry before we use it again. So far we have had no problems with the bag...but I have not washed-it and am not sure how that might effect it's effectiveness.",5
Yookidoo Stack 'N' Spray Tub Fountain,"I bought this toy recently from a store that my 1 year old daughter had a gift card from since Christmas.  It was pricier at that store and I would have bought it from Amazon had a not had a gift card.  This toy is so much fun...my daughter loves it and laughs hysterically with all the ways the water squirts out.  There is no wrong way to stack the parts so it makes it so easy for her to play with and I am sure she will enjoy it for years to come.  The only thing is because we don't put her water too high, we can't use the attachment that keeps it in place...so it floats around...but I think that makes it more fun anyway...After reading the other reviews about the battery compartment problems, I am going to double check ours (as we've only used it twice)...but so far so good!",5
"Munchkin Portable Diaper Caddy, Blue",This portable diaper caddy is small so you can keep it almost anywhere.  It is well made and super cute.,5
Kidswitch Light Switch Extender- 3 Pack,"The idea is excellent.  We failed to realize, though, our light switches are all placed rather high on our walls.  Our tall 2 year old is still at least 3 inches from touching the bottom of the star....  our home is circa 1920's which may have something to do with the switch placement.  Not sure.....",3
Munchkin Sesame Street Fresh Food Feeder,"Love this because had the  elmo face on it. First one i brought with face on it. This was for my grandson, wish they had this one when my  kids was little.

"Safety 1st Aerolite Deluxe Stroller, Silver Leaf","We bought this stroller to ""upgrade"" from the safety 1st jaunt travel system.The GOODThe slidegaurd, which keeps a child's head from getting caught between the tray if they happen to undo thier buckle.The fold is easy to doEven though it's not a all terrain stroller, it works well over gravel, grass and dirtThe canopy is unlike any other it gives you the option of sheilding from the sun while having a nice brezze come through the mesh opening, howeverdoesn't help when it rains, even when buttoned up.The BADAfter using this stroller for about a month (I used it almost everyday & sometimes through gravel/bumpy sidewalks) it would squeak even after using WD-40The wheels would stop rolling after going over a bumpThe seat back was hard, no cushion what so ever, but if you happen to have a extra car seat or highchair padding around you could use that, which is what I ended up doing.The storage basket is at a angle to if your doing lots of shopping be sure to put your heavy items in front and small in the back otherwise the heavy item will just keep sliding towards the front.The cup holder on the parents tray are short, any slight bump i would go over and my water bottle will fall out rolling down the street.Overall for the price now (we paid over $150 through here) I would say it's worth if you don't mind the bad, although I think they should of added the car seat with it. When connected and all canopys are closed it makes a nice sheild from looky loos. Also there is no front wheel lock to make it a fixed /swivel stroller.",3
Baby Abc Pastel Quilt,"The quality and size of this are definitely lacking given the cost of the quilt.  Definitely shop around, much smaller than you think.",1
KAYSCASE Premium HD Bubble Free Tampered Glass Screen Protector 0.33mm Super Thin for iPhone 5 / iPhone 5S / iPhone 5C,it looks really good. it doesn't make the screen blurry like other screen protectors and so far I haven't seen any scratches so I'm pretty much happy with my purchase.,5
"OXO Tot Baby Blocks Freezer Storage Containers 2 Ounce, Set 6, Clear",These are fantastic.  You will not be disappointed with their ability to stay sealed.  Definately the best I have come across.  The lids are sometimes difficult to dry out fully. But I didn't see it as a problem.,5
Fisher-Price On-the-Go Placemat,"I have been searching for items on the net to purchase that will allow my son NOT to throw his plate on the floor.  I purchased all different kinds of products/brands, and nothing has worked at this point.  The suction cups on the bottom of ALL the items/brands I have bought, don't work.  There is just not enough suction behind them.  I would apply pressure, wetness, you name it, and nothing worked.  After about 3 minutes, the product would unstick itself and the plate/bowls/cups were tossed.  This product here is a waste of money and your time spent returning it...TRUST me!",1
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","It is a good toy. I rated 4 stars because the yellow color is not bright enough but Blue and Green work very well. My daughter loves it. Every night, she has to turn on and pick the color that she likes for each night before she fall asleep.  And the 45 min timer is great.Highly recommend to buy it....",4
Bumbleride Indie Twin Stroller - Green Papyrus,"The reason I didn't like the bumble ride  stroller is, because it is not useful for new born twins. It says it is comparable with greco car seats but what it clearly doesn't explain is how many car seat. It only can fit one car seat. So for 8 weeks twins, I have to wait six month to be able to use it. Even that might not gone happen since my twin are premieIt will be very useful for family that have kids with different age ..",2
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","In a family with over thirty first cousins, you end up having lots of kids running around needing presents. For some reason, this Constellation Night Light turtle was a HUGE hit with the kids.I have purchased four of these turtles so far in the last two years, and the children always love them. While I'm unsure about the soft plushiness combined with the plastic shell and a light source inside, the kids don't seem to mind and actually enjoy the turtle lying around their room at night, shining lights up onto the ceiling.If you've got small kids who are fussy at night, give this a shot. You might find that you'll be buying yourself one - or at least sneaking it into your room once in a while.",4
Bebe Au Lait Cotton Nursing Cover - Bali,"I really like this cover. It's very pretty and it folds up small to fit in my diaper bag. I love the hoop at the top to be able to see down to your baby. Using a blanket is awful compared to one of these. I also love the terry cloth pocket in the corner to hold your nursing pad or wipe up messes.That said, it seems a bit expensive for what it is, and the &#34;multi-use!&#34; claims above make me roll my eyes. No, it can't double as a blanket, it's way too thin for that. (Which is nice so your baby doesn't get hot while nursing.) I'm deducting a star for what feels like too high of a cost, but other than that it's a good cover and I'd buy it again if something ever happened to this one.",4
"Dream On Me 2 in 1 Portable Folding Stationary Side Crib, Cherry","This is a great product, However, it is poorly made and the instructions are impossible to decipher. Where it calls for assembly the holes are in the wrong places and not drilled to the proper depth. This is a shame because once we disregarded the instructions and finally got it together it was a great product and just what we wanted.",3
White Knob Lock - 2 Pieces,Great for baby proofing. These are probably my favorite after trying several different kinds. Fairly easy to use and keeps the little ones from escaping or opening doors and tumbling down stairs. Would buy again.,5
"Dreambaby Manicure Set, Blue/yellow","I like the scissors and the clippers, both work well.  The emery boards are way to rough, instead of being a fine grain for baby nails.",5
"Bummis Super Brite Diaper Cover, Pink, 8-16 Pounds","This is a great cover made in Canada. Bought a couple, then went ahead and ordered more in larger sizes. This cover does the job it is meant to do. Gussets help keep leaks contained.  The print is cute and gender neutral.  I just fold prefolds and lay them in the center; it is really that easy. They aren't stiff or crinkly once you break them in.  The only downside is velcro. Velcro is great because it gives you a very good fit in the waist so you don't have a cover falling off or cutting into the baby belly. But all velcro will fail in time and this one is no exception.  It might take hundreds of washed but eventually the velcro will lose the stickiness. I have covers that are this way and I still use them in a pinch with a onsie to help keep them in place. These do have laundry tabs and that is helpful. This is just the nature of velcro and I do not blame Bummis.",4
"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","We bought two for a one and two year old knowing it will be the last car seat we ever buy.Solid, safe and portable - we just flew 12 hours to New Zealand and they sat in them on the plane as well for a comfortable flight.  Folded down reasonable flat and we were able to stack them on a trolley along with all our other suitcases.",5

"aden + anais 2 Pack Muslin Burpy Bib, Princess Posie","These are the best burp cloths- they are bigger than all the others I bought, plus the shape helps them to stay in place on your shoulder. They are soft and absorbent, plus they have a snap to make them into a large bib. Superb!",5
Chicco Polly Highchair Woodstock,"This chair is advertised as having extra ""trays"" but in reality this model only has ONE extra tray. I find all the Chico colors muddy and unattractive and this is no exception. It was much cheaper here than at the local stores and we needed 2 chairs for our 2 new grandkids and I need them to fold and be stored between uses. The Chico apparently folds as flat or flatter than other chairs of its kind, but I miss the circa-1970 Cosco high chairs we had for our kids! They were nice metal chairs with metal tray and folded VERY flat! I sure wish I had kept ours when we moved to AZ! I am not impressed with all this overpriced plastic crapola with the ""bells and whistles"". I don't think this chair will be sturdy enough to be able to serve as a youth chair for a rambunctious toddler, but I hope I am wrong since it was so expensive. I have very little faith that any of this expensive plastic stuff will be around to be handed down and I'm sure that's what the manufacturers have in mind! Shipping time was longer than expected but the chairs arrived in perfect condition. But if I saw the old Cosco chairs at a garage sale, I'd  buy one and get rid of this behemoth in a second. The wheels are the best feature.",3
"Evenflo Amp Performance No Back Booster Car Seat, Green","My daughter loves this booster seat.  The seat is soft, so long car rides are not painful.  she especially loves the cup holder on the side to keep her drinks close by without spilling.",5
"Munchkin Easy-Close Metal Gate, White","Easy enough for my 3 yr old to open but keeps my 1 yr old out of the bathroom.  Easy to install, heavy duty.  Recommend to anyone.",5
Green Sprouts Nail Brush,"I looked hard and long to find a nail brush for my four week old little granddaughter and finally had the brilliant thought to look on Amazon where I found the perfect item,the Green Sprouts nail brush, and at what a bargain price:  less than the harsh and ugly nail brushes at the drug store.This little brush is the perfect size for baby's little fingers and very, very soft.  It is made from natural fibers and wood and I use it every time when I give the baby a bath especially now that she is starting to grab things and her little nails get dirty.What a wonderful product that I whole heartedly recommend to moms of newborns.",5
Graco Secure Coverage Digital Baby Monitor with 2 Parent Units,"While this worked, it worked well. But, both handsets died within a year of buying it. One after about 6 months and the other a couple months later. Now I am having to buy another monitor for our second child, less than two years later.",2
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"I bought this when my son was two months old, based on ""Top Ten Best Toys for Infants"" lists, and I can really see why this is consistently at the top of those lists!This toy is large, about a foot long, and is made of a multitude of different brightly colored and textured fabrics for sensory play. The back of the butterfly is in graphic blacks and whites, which really worked for my 2 month old (at the time) since he was mesmerized by the black and white patterns until he got old enough and his vision improved enough to appreciate bright colors too. It comes with a large hook on top so you can hang it into any baby play-yard with an overhead arch, and the hook is sturdy, so your baby can't easily yank it down. The wings are made of crinkly fabric, and it comes with an internal rattle, a squeaker on one wing, a mirror on another wing, and two plastic rings on the bottom so your baby can yank on the butterfly and gnaw on the rings to his heart's content.Somewhat negatives: The hook is pretty thick and sturdy (which is a good thing) but it makes the toy not all that ""Take Along"" as the hook makes it nearly impossible to hang it on the carseat handle...we HAVE done so, but it requires a lot of muscle. Also the toy is a bit heavy and large so you DO have to hang it on something so the baby can play with it, so pairing it with a play-yard of some kind with an overhead arch is almost required.Overall, a great investment! Now my son is six months old, and he still gets hours of playtime out of this butterfly.",5

Capri Stroller - Red Tech,"When I gave birth to my 3rd child, my other children were 12 months old, and 5 years old... I do own a double stroller now that the baby is 7 months, the toddler is about 18 months, and my daughter is 5.5... but I also knew a single stroller would be needed.1.  The Chicco is reasonably priced for an umbrella stroller with ""benifits"", some like it are over $150 which I find ridicuous2.  The Chicco is very sturdy, and reliable... yet pretty lightweight. Its easy for me to lift, steer, push, and fold (although this requires the use of both hands). I wasnt in the market for a $5 piece of junk that would rattle and collapse as I strolled it around the block. The Chicco can handle almost everyplace we go, and is always in the car (takes up minimal space)3.  For a baby or toddler, the Chicco couldnt be better. The seat substantially reclines, and allows the baby to get in a good nap, this is also achievable if the baby is sleeping. The Chicco also has a five-point harness thats easy to adjust and use. Its pretty comfortable, and my son has never been bothered by it before. Theres also a fairly large canopy, although it only protects from directly overhead, its not curved (but what can you expect for an umbrella stroller?)4.  For me and my husband, the stroller has TALL handles (hes 6""2) and they are very comfortable (something VERY important to us!). I also love that the stroller is designed with parents in mind, niether of us bang our feet into the wheels as we walk, which was a problimatic occurance in my sisters Triumph stroller. We are also able to store a VERY small diaper bag inside the basket, which is a big sigh of relief!All in all if you are on the market for a simple, reliable stroller to take you from point A to point B, purchase the Chicco and I doubt you will be dissapointed.",5
Evenflo Crosstown Soft Portable Travel Gate,"We bought this item because we rent a home. It seemed like it would be perfect because it did not have to be mounted into the wall brackets. That is the only positive thing about this gate. It is nearly impossible to stretch out and keep it locked so that it tightly fits the wall. We also we attracted to the expansion because our opening is 60 inches. We cannot get it to stay locked and therefore it falls down. Once in a while, it will work and stay locked but it was not very sturdy.  If you don't mind leaving it up and walking over it, then it will be just fine. We found that once we took it down, we couldn't get it back up. With two of us pulling on it for 15 minutes, we finally gave up. It's really not worth the money for a larger opening. We were going to use it to block off the hallway, but it doesn't get small enough to fit in that opening. I guess you get what you pay for.",1
Lambs and Ivy Enchanted Forest Rug,"Our little boy's nursery isn't too big so this little rug with it's bright colors was a perfect fit. It also matched the color scheme we designed the room in and the quirkiness of it is well appreciated. Oh and for those who are wondering the size since it's not listed, it's 40x30.",5
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,I like the concept of this produtc.  It has many uses.  My daughter is still kind of unsure about it but I know when she gets used to it she will love it.  Very good for eating on the go.,3
"Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Butterfly Garden","My son had the boys version over 2 years ago, but only wanted to be held so we gave it away. Now my newborn daughter (she 3 1/2 months old) loves hers. The mobile and the lights don't entertain her for very long, but she takes all her naps which last between 1-3 hours on this swing. One of the main reasons I bought this particular swing is because you don't need batteries. We often forget to turn it off after taking her out and it never runs out of juice. For those customers who complain about the noise, I think they may have to open the legs wider. If you leave them too tight, it makes an annoying noise. Also if the baby and/or blanket is too heavy, it may make the same noise. I had too adjust the speed (level 3 for my 13 pounder and her blanket). I did not feel the need to start using the straps to hold her in until this week since she's become more mobile and could possibly fall out.  I sometimes also lay some sheets over the curtains on the swing to make it darker for her naps. Highly recommend this swing.",4
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Green/Blue","We got this seat instead of a highchair and it's worked out great, so far.  It straps firmly to any chair and is portable, so you can bring it to a friend's house to feed your baby.  It's also very easy to clean.",5
DEX Products Baby Wipes Warmer,"In the hospital, there wasn't a wipes warmer and our baby had super fits with every change.  Once we finally got home, the screaming diaper changes stopped with the use of the wipes warmer - it just makes this new task less truamatic for them.  I do find keeping it as full as possible is the trick, so that the wipes are closer to the top/heating element.  Also, cheap wipes do not work because they're not folded together and you can't get them to go through the top slot.  The Huggies wipes work the best as they come out the top nicely.  LOVE this item.",5
Safety 1st Deluxe 4-in-1 Bath Station,"I purchased this tub because the toddler ring will not suction to the bottom of our tub.  This tub seemed to have great features, particularly the easy storage feature.  However, the underside of the inner ring has sharp edges, leaving my 6 month old with red marks across her chest and arms.  I have already returned it and was very disappointed.",2
"Leachco Back 'N Belly Contoured Body Pillow, Ivory",My daughter pregnant with twins and asked me to get it. Came quickly and she says it has made a huge difference for her. Very happy with product,5
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","I did TONS of research and ended up deciding between this seat and the Graco Nautilus.  My 2 1/2 year old son is very big for his age (almost 40 lbs and 39"") and was outgrowing his Britax Roundabout.  I had him sit in both the Graco and the Frontier (I recommend trying the seats with your child in them).  As many reviews had stated, I too found that the crotch strap on the Graco was almost under him, even in the farthest setting. The Graco also fits a little narrower where his shoulders were.  So even though the price of the Graco was much lower than the Frontier, I felt that he would outgrow it very soon.  Since he's so young he'll need the 5 point harness for a few years still at least so I decided on the Frontier.My complaints (very minor) with the frontier are 1)that the strap that you pull to tighten the harness has a lot of resistence and so I really have to pull hard on it and pull up on the shoulder straps simultaneously to get the straps tight .  2) The lever to loosen the harness is not as easy to access as on the Roundabout- it is covered with fabric and I have to feel around for it.  And 3)I still can't find the ""pouch"" where the instruction book is supposed to go.  Also when I reach to get the harness strap I always seem to grab the flap of the cover on the seat because it is not completely attached.  These are really minor complaints.I also tried installing both seats into my car- a Volvo V70 (I recommend trying the seats in your vehicle too since many complaints on these seats involved installation issues). I did not have any problem tightening the seat down using LATCH or the seat belt method. I wish the Frontier 85 still had the LATCH adjustments on both sides rather than just one side, but I was able to get the seat just as tight.",4
"Orbit Baby G3 Infant Car Seat Plus Base, Black","This is the Cadillac of car seats! Please do not think this is the car seat to take in and out of the car. It weighs about 40-45 pounds by itself. However, it is VERY nice. The swivel base is amazing to take the child out of the car. You can use it from birth to about 40 pounds! We love it. So glad we are rolling with the big dogs! :)",5
"Merino Kids Baby Sleep Sack For Babies 0-2 Years, Banbury","I just received my sleep sack that I was planning to use for my 3-month-old daughter.  The side seams are badly twisted on both sides, and the sack does not lie flat.  It looks like it was either sewn improperly or washed or dried at high heat.  Other reviewers stated that items made in certain countries were of lesser quality.  The one I received was made in India.  These have gotten such great reviews, and I really don't want to use a polyester sleep sack, so I plan to order another one in the hopes that the next one won't be defective.UPDATE: I just received a second sleep sack after sending the first one back.  I now know that the first sack sent to me had been washed and/or dried improperly and then returned.  It was about half the size of the new replacement, and came with no instructions or tags.  The wool on the inside was also pilly.  The reason the seams were all twisted and wavy was because the garment had shrunk but the seams hadn't.  There was no way it would still fit my baby at two years old.The new one was quite large and laid flat, and came with a pretty mesh bag as well as instructions for use.  Unfortunately my baby hasn't been weaned from swaddling so I haven't gotten any use out of it yet.  I tried putting her down for her nap in the sleep sack and she wouldn't stop crying.  I gave up and swaddled her instead.  I will update this once we're able to wean her from swaddling (hopefully soon).  I will also be very careful about how I wash and dry it, since I know what will happen if I do it wrong.",1
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Classic Polypropylene Bottle, Opaque, 4 Ounce, 2 Pack","I have bought Avent bottles in 2010. They were light yellow. I loved the product! My children adapted well with nipples.Now, I bought another bottles. I received a new product, white. There is a piece that problably prevents liquids from leaking. It is ok, although I do not feel comfortable to send the bottle to the kindergarten (too many pieces to handle with).But, what I think it a step back on this product, is that the nipple is so soft that the child mouth blocks the passage of the milk. Every now and then I have to take the nipple out of his mouth, wait for the air to flow and than give the bottle to him again. It is not comfortable, since my children already take milk by themselves, but they are not old enough to know what to do when the milk is not flowing.",3
Booginhead SippiGrip - Blue,"This has saved my kids cup, toys, blankets, anything that can get dropped really form hitting the ground so many times. We love all the booginhead products we have tried. the Paci Clips are great but they will rust if exposed to water often. Say when your baby is in the kitty pool.",4
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"1st time mom and this was my saving grace. We used it for 3 months and was worth every penny. My daughter was really fussy and not much of anything calmed her but this bouncer consistantly did the trick. My Daughter LOVED this bouncer. She liked all the toys, sounds and lights. She will now stare at our fish tank for sometimes an hour. The Vibration option ran on 1 C"" battery,for a month. If I used the lights and music which took 3 C"" batteries they didn't last near as long but, she still was calmed by the vibrations and looking at the fish. I had NO problems with this product...read the directions and cautions and you shouldn't have any problems either. I stopped using it when she became stronger and moved more... seemed common sense to me. It's not a heavy duty toy but a very entertaining and calming product. It's not easy or convenient to store after it's put togeather. It doesn't fold up which is the only reason I am getting rid of it now.",5

Baby Einstein Discovering Music Activity Table,My 1yr. old grandson loves this and it educational!,5
"BooginHead Pacifier Holder, Pink Polka Dot",Bought this to keep the pacifier in the general vicinity of the baby. Normally he spits it out and cries like a little...baby.Before the pacifier would forever be lost in the catacombs underneath him but now I can easily find the pacifier again.I do wish the clamp was easier to use with one hand but I can see it's really secure and that's what really matters.,4
"Evenflo Convertible High Chair, Dottie Rose",I think the design of the high chair is smart and like that it can double as a chair and table.  It is also sturdy/won't tip over due to the wide base.  It's also very light and easy to move.  Cons are that it doesn't fold up so it may not work if you done have a lot of room.  Also the seat cover is a little slippery and sometimes my baby slumps a little down in the seat and I have to readjust her for optimal eating posture. But I think that will resolve as she grows bigger.  Overall OK for the money.,4
Traffic Light Lamp,Junk..dont buy your wasting your money. Cheaply made and didnt work when I got it...I thought it was bigger and the quality was better.  Requesting a refund. You can have it back.,1
"Thirsties Hemp Inserts 2 Pack, Small 6-18 Lbs","We have bought quite a few packs of these. They are a MUST for overnight cloth diapering. Our son sleeps about 12 hours straight and these keep him from waking up with a wet diaper and also keep him from getting a rash. They really SOAK up a lot! Which also means they need extra drying time when they come out of the wash, so we end up hang drying them while we put the rest of the diapers in the dryer.",5
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","This is perfect for the tub, it's simple, cute, and more importantly serves the purpose of keeping the faucet hidden.",5
"Zoli Gummy Sticks Baby Gum Massagers, Green/Orange","My son is just 9 weeks old and he has been showing signs of early teething for a few weeks now. I tried the teething rings we were given at our baby shower but they were just to big for his little mouth.  The only thing that was working to sooth him was sticking my pinky finger in his mouth so he could chew on it.  I wanted something I could stick in his mouth, and that he could learn to grip as well.  As soon as I put it in his mouth he was happy!  It was an instant pleaser and easily took the place of my finger.  He has even held it on his once once!  I'm glad to have found something that fits in his mouth and makes teething a bit better.",4
"American Baby Company 100% Cotton Percale Fitted Cradle Sheet, Ecru","I was very unhappy with this sheet.  I bought it for my grand babys cradle.  Delivery was prompt.  However I found the sheet to be rough feeling and the fit for the cradle was not good.  I have ordered other items form the same company and have been very satisfied.  However, I would not recommend the cotton percale sheet.",2

Nuby 5 Count Splish Splash Stacking Bath Cups,"My son loves filling the cups and dumping the water out during his baths. They are colorful, have different shapes and sizes, easy to clean and easy to store. I wish they were not made in China but, like most toys, I could not find cups for this price that were made elsewhere. Simple design but hours of fun.",5
Magic Bumpers Portable Child Bed Safety Guard Rail 48 Inch,"We bought our 1yr old daughter one of those plastic toddler beds that 'come with rails'... The problem is, the rails are all the way up by her head and don't go down far enough (for any child I would think). Well she's a pretty crazy sleeper, so eventually throughout the night she would scoot to the bottom and come close to falling out. Eventually she did fall out twice, but was okay because she fell right into the dogs bed lolAnd then began my hunt for bed rails for the bed 'with rails'! Everything I found was made for regular toddler beds or cribs, I didn't want to take the chance of having to send something back. Luckily I cam across these Magic Bumpers!! They fit her bed just right!! Tonight will be the first night to test them, but I am confident they will work :D The only slight problem which I did read about, is the fitted sheet won't go all the way down anymore :/ Thus my hunt for deep pocketed crib sheets! Any suggestions? :]",4
DoorSmoocher Childproof Sliding Pocket Door and Swing Door Lock,"I used these on a set of dual pocket doors that the builder neglected to install a lock on.  The only reason we need a lock is a super smart cat.  While this stops her from opening the door, there is a gap that causes the doors to move together from left to right (about an inch).  Cat seems more interested in playing with the door now...",2
Peg Perego P3 Light Weight One Hand Fold Stroller in Mod Verde,"Green canopy, brilliant on the park, no one just passing, they stare it, said ""it is beautiful"" somtimes.Real smooth riding and turnning, really tough even on the gravel road and soccer complex. All the moving part, designed for comportable. My 11 month daughter love this more than car seat. Do not buy retail price. I buy one zt $176. Do not pay full price for current year model. Buy one from last year at half price then enjoy primium product and pride.",5
"green sprouts Baby Food Mill, Green",I like this for making baby food for my 8 month old.  It makes a good consitancy for a baby that has already started with some solids.  It won't get it fine enough for a new eater.  The only thing I don't like about it is that it leaks out the bottom so you have to use it over the sink.  I bought it hoping to take it to restaurants but I can't imagine doing that if it leaks.,3

"Dr. Brown's 8 oz. Natural Flow Wide Neck Bottle, 3 Pack","My baby has reflux.  It has been an uphill battle finding formula and medication to help control her problem.  These bottles are a great addition to the arsenal combating the problem.  They don't add to the overload on her poor tummy by by allowing excess air in.  I've experimented with Playtex nursers, Avent nursers, and regular bottles trying to find something that would help and not add to the problem.  After an unfortunate incident wherein I managed to pop the bag in the Playtex nurser while attempting to release excess air, the baby managing to collapse the nipple on the Avent, and a terrible vomiting episode after using the regular bottles, Dr. Brown's have been a God Send.",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Lunchie Insulated Lunch Bag, Monkey","We fell in love with this lunch bag.  it's adorable and matches his book bag.  I was hesitant in ordering this because child tried zipping and unzipping two other skip hop lunch bags at target.  The ziper keeps getting stuck behind the animal's features ( hair, arms,) that are flapping adjacent to zipperline.  It was so cute we ordered the bee one anyway.  However it is not stain resistant or big enough for a preschooler's lunch and snacks.  The pocket that holds the ice pack has no closure so the ice pack always falls out when you move the bag.  For one dollar more, I will purchase a stain resistant and larger lunchbox with horizontal and vertical strap/ handle with easy zippering.Be prepared to scrub hand wash this lunchbag daily since yellow is such a light color.",3
Prince Lionheart Stroller Connectors,I don't love them I don't hate them.  I don't use them as much as I thought I would just because it takes a minute to attach everything and usually it's just easier to have one of my other kids push the other stroller.,3
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Non Spill Soft Spouts, 6 Months","please don't waste your money on these spouts that are not a Klean Kanteen product, they are just Avent spouts that you can buy for less than $5 at Target and not have to pay another $4 for shipping.",4

"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Assembly was really easy, it took me less than 10 minutes to mount it. Just follow the instructions. Door is easy to open for my 2 year old, unless I apply the safe &#34;red button&#34;, so I can use it to stop the cat from entering a room (allowing my 2 years old to go in and out) or to stop the toddler and the cat with the safety thing on.If you put enough pressure against it, it will detach. So far not  a problem with my kid, but please, follow instructions and don't use it on top of stairs without screws.",4
Lambs &amp; Ivy Baby Aviator Sheet,I love this pattern and I had to have this sheet since it matched the window valences.  It's just WAY too overpriced for a fitted sheet.,4
"Prince Lionheart Table Edge Guard with 4 Corners, Grey","We got this to use on a nice looking storage box that would hold toys, and look like it was ment to be in the family room. The box is a bit taller than the typical toy box and has sharp corners.  I thought we needed both edge guards and corner guards.  But after putting on the corners, I found the foam padding was stronger and softer than I expected and now we have the Edge Guards to use elsewhere.  Because of the length of the edge guards, even more uses may come from this.  More money to spend on the baby and we all now how much they want/need.",5
DaVinci Emily Mini Crib - White,"This little crib is really well made, cute and just the right size for small babies.  The mattress that comes with it is worthless, however.  I bought the mattress that is recommended to be used with it.",5

Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing -  Nature's Touch N1973,"This swing turned out to be the most valuable shower gift we received. Our one month old didn't like sleeping in the cradle we had set up for him next to our bed. He has been sleeping in this swing since his second night home from the hospital. It's the perfect size so he feels nestled in and cozy. I feel at ease knowing he's on his back but propped up just a little in case he spits up. Plus he doesn't like being flat on his back yet anyway. The music and other sounds along with the rocking make it easy to soothe him to sleep. I just lean over from my bed and turn it on. It shuts off automatically so I don't need to worry about that. He's also now enjoying the mirror and mobile overhead, so he's perfectly happy in the swing when he's awake too. This swing has been a lifesaver for us!",5
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,"I loved these, I've had other kinds in the past but this one was by far the best quality, very easy to install. I used it on a corner cabinet but it also worked on a double door cabinet. We are moving so I had to take them off, I had a little bit of trouble getting them off, which is actually a good thing, if you don't want them removed. All and All, I definitely recommend these over the other products out there.",5
Safety 1st Bottle Medicine Dispenser,"I bought this to give my son his daily vitamans. Dr. said it would be best to mix with milk as the vitamains tend to stain. He is only breast feed so I just needed a small bottle for him. This works well, but my son dose not seem to like the shape of the nipple. When he does take a bottle he uses the Tommie Tippy brand which has a much diffrent nipple. Likely would work great for other kids who are better with a bottle",4
"Playtex Diaper Genie Elite Diaper Disposal Pail, White","The concept - awesome.  But our 2nd one in a year is already broken. So, I either have a diaper stuffing husband on my hands that forces the diapers in and breaks it, or the design is faulty. The spring is broken/disconnected so it's hard to get the diapers in the &#34;chute&#34;.  We can't figure out how to fix it. Another easy route would be using biodegradable dog doo bags to contain the smell and using a regular garbage.  Seems pretty easy to me. The bag refills get pricey.",3
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","Got these to prevent some sun from blinding my little girl now that she's front facing in her car seat. Got them and all seemed great until I went to use them. And the sun was still blinding her, just through these. Maybe blocked 10% but not at all successful for reducing the direct sun rays. Try a different brand, this isn't worth it even though it seems like your getting a good deal price wise",2

"Razbaby RaZ-berry Teether, Red","It's really cute to look at, but we were hoping that is choop would be useful.The raspberry part of the teether is way too big for our three-month-old's mouth.  She gags and chokes with the red part of the teeether in her mouth.She's teething already and we've been looking around for something for her to gnaw on besides me (ouch).This teether is not useful to us.  Save your money and try something else, unless you just want a ""cute"" baby item to decorate your house.",1
Nickelodeon Backyardigans Toddler Bed,"My son loves the Backyardigans, so I was thrilled to find a Backyardigans toddler bed for him to move into after his crib.  The bed did come in a different color theme than shown though, which I am actually happier with.  It came in a lighter blue/yellow color and showed the Backyardigans on their pirate ship.  Very cute!",5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"Overall, we have found this to be a great monitor.  We really like the voice activated feature.  However, I just wanted to make everyone aware that once the battery dies (for us it took about 1 1/2 years) you cannot find a replacement battery anywhere except to order it directly from Sony and with tax and shipping it costs $18 for one battery!",4

"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White","As the subject of my review reads, it was a breeze to install, and it has been a good deterrent for my curious toddler.

Bento Decoration - Food Picks (Animal) 15pcs,"I purchased these to add a little bit of cute to my lunch without having to do any actual work.

The colors are bright and fun and they were exactly as pictured!",5

"Prince Lionheart Wheely Bug, Ladybug, Large","I gave the Wheely Mouse to my granddaughter for her first birthday.  It is well made and as cute as can be.  She was fascinated by the ears.

"Leachco BumpZZZ Travel Bed, Brown/Green Forest Frolics","we bought several travel beds for our 16 month old who could climb out of his pack n play.  all the others were air mattresses and seemed uncomfortable.  he woke up all night crying on them.  for the next trip we got the bumpzzz and it was great.  it seemed much more comfortable and my son was excited about his """"big boy bed.""""  the raised edges helped him stay inside the bed all night and not roll out.  he loved the owl fabric.  there is room for some of his crib toys to sleep in it with him.  it folds up easily but it is kind of large for travel.  it dies take up a good amount of space in our car.",5
Sassy Sensation Station Suction Toy,"Great baby toy.  However, the music doesn't last long.  This is the second one I've bought and within weeks the batteries have run out leaving my grandson frustrated because it is his favorite toy and he loves the music.",4
"Britax Marathon G4 Convertible Car Seat, Cowmooflage","Okay so for the longest time, I told myself that I would never get a Britax, no reason other than the price. After reading countless reviews, I finally decided to do it, and seriously, I'll NEVER go back to any other car seat brand. Ever. Ever since my daughter moved to a front facing seat, she NEVER slept in the car. Even on long road trips. She would maybe sleep for like 20 minutes and call it good. This is why I decided to give Britax a try. Ever since having the Britax, SHE SLEEPS!! The seat reclines beautifully, making sleeping easier on those little bobbling necks. I LOVE IT! Also the little things, like the clips that attach the car seat to your car metal clips, they have a button, so you're not getting your fingers down in there, and pinching them and whatever else. (I know that doesn't really make sense, but if you buy this seat, you'll understand. It's amazing.) Just do it. Spend the cash. You won't regret it.",5
Chicco Little Driver Baby Walker,"My 4 month old daughter LOVES this walker. It adjusts down a lot lower than most walkers we've seen so her toes can touch the ground. The buttons on it make cute noises; cat and dog sounds, bells, whistles and songs. The tray is also easily removed so she can play with other toys if need be. Great purchase!",5
"MAM BPA Free 5 oz Bottle for Boy, 3-Pack ((Patterns and motifs may vary)","After trying literally every bottle on the market to get my exclusively breastfed baby to take a bottle so she could start daycare, I found these. Although she didn't just take to them real well right away as she just didn't want bottles at all, these were the ones she actually 'tried' to take. She still refuses some days but these bottles are still the ones she prefers and she always refuses all others. The nipples are the most soft of all the silicone ones I have tried and they are flattened in shape more like the breast. The nipples have a textured velvety feel to them too. The bottles are easy to use and easy to clean, cap, nipple, ring, body, base, and rubber piece. Just be sure you seat the bottom rubber seal evenly. I haven't had any problem with leaking. The bottles are just plain cute as well. So glad I bought these! Would recommend to anyone.",5
"Munchkin Safety Sunblock Shade, Hello Kitty",it was pretty i like its loos but i thought i was getting 2. i gave it a 3 because i find it a bit small and doesn't completely shade  my baby . the baby loves it though.,3
Kalencom 2-in-1 Potette Plus Red,"My son is on the small side for a twenty month old boy.  I purchased this product after I realized that he would not use the big potty at his sister's swim practice, and he was refusing to wear anything but his big boy pants... They sell this product at a major toy store for very little money so I bought it there.  For putting it on a big potty it works WONDERFUL.  No issues there at all.  The size is great for carrying with you, and the bag that comes with it is a nice touch.  My only issue is that when I set it up as a stand alone potty and my son promplty sat down on it, it collapsed.  I tried it again, same thing (much more reluctant child though).  I was not able to get it to click into place, which is apparently the problem... I do think its worth the money though, especially if you get one that will click into place.  Sure its small, but this is for babies as young as 15 months.. bigger toddlers/pre schoolers will likely need something else.",3
"OXO Tot Tub Drain Stopper, Blue","It isn't rocket science, but the OXO Tub Drain Stopper works pefectly. One bathtub slowly drains during baths. This completely stops it. It stays put on the drain, comes up easily when pulled, and hangs on the side of the tub when not in use as advertised.I hope this doesn't sound like an advertisement, but considering how inexpensive this is, it turns out to be a great value for the money. It saved us a visit from a plumber or an afternoon replaceming the built in stopper.",5
Dr. Brown's Lace Contoured Breast Pads,"After reading reviews of other breast pads, I decided to try Dr. Brown's. They are large (good coverage) and absorbent (no leaks or damp feeling) without being too thick and noticeable. You can easily fold them out of the way in your bra cup when nursing. The liner is a comfy jersey-like material and the outer ""lace"" helps to keep the pad from sliding around in your bra. They come in a package of 4 with a small net bag so you can throw them in the washing machine. I haven't used other breast pads apart from the Medela disposables (which are individually wrapped -- too wasteful for my taste) but I'm not tempted after buying these.",5
Sealy Baby Posturepedic Crown Jewel Mattress,This mattress is firm but it definitely has a little give to it. Seems extremely comfortable! Makes my husband and I want a new mattress for ourselves,5
Sassy Baby's Mam 9 oz. Girl 3 pack Bottle,"I bought these specifically after the BPA scare and not wanting to pay so much for the born free bottles. Overall I think these are good. When I put them in the bottle warmer they do seem to take longer than the other bottles to heat up, perhaps because they are thicker and wider at the bottom. I don't have problems with dripping but always make sure the bottom is screwed on correctly otherwise I can see the potential for dripping. Cleaning is not too difficult.",4
Ocean Wonders Sea Life Double Toggle Light Switchplate Cover,I received this quickly and was so impressed with the service. the plate is beautiful and good quality so i'm getting the other matching outlet cover. thank you!,5
Philips Avent Baby Bath and Room Thermometer Sch550/20,"Superb thermometer!  very handy, made well!  it can stand on it's on in the room and show temp in C.  great design, sort of rubber design.  and can also be put in the water for the reading.  Bought 2 of these, one for the room, one for the bathroom for our newborn.  Outstanding Avent!",5
Baby Einstein Count and Compose Piano,"This is a fun little toy that my 6-month old son enjoys playing with. As another reviewer mentioned, one of the great things about this piano is how varied the melodies are. Not only does it play classical pieces but your child can compose his/her own music as well, which means mom and dad don't have to hear the same melody over and over and over... big plus!The one down-side is that the speaker is on the bottom of the toy, which means that if your child doesn't hold the piano on his/her lap while playing with it the sounds is very muffled. My son still likes to play with it - muffled sounds and all - but I can't help marveling that the designers put the speaker in such an unfavorable location. Einstein would blush to know that such an obvious design flaw was incorporated into a product with his name on it!",3
"Carters Wrap Me Up Receiving Blanket, 4 Pack, Green",Cons:Too small for swaddling.Too small and thin for wrapping up baby and feeling cozy.Pros:Cute patterns.Comes out of the dryer feeling soft.,2
Fisher-Price Discover 'n Grow Take-Along Play Blanket,I brought this blanket for my daughter-in-law. The ability to carry this product all folded into the zebra was a great plus.. easy to take with you and have an immediate blanket to place baby on.Interactive toys will be great as she gets older all in one package. I think any young mum would find this handy to have and it makes for a great gift idea as well.,4

"Moby Wrap Original 100% Cotton Baby Carrier, Red","I wanted some way to wear my baby that would be comfortable for both of us.  A few friends recommended moby and moby style wraps, so I got this with high hopes.  My son and I both found it cumbersome, hot, and constricting.  Maybe we weren't doing something right, but he hated.*There are SO many layers of material, once you finally manage to get the damned thing on properly, that the both of you will be sweating like proverbial professional women in a church before long.*Actually getting the thing ON is way too much like work, and if you want to nurse in it, it takes even more finagling and adjustment. I never managed to successfully nursed in my moby wrap.  It could be that I am too well endowed to nurse in a wrap, but the way the wrap squashed my son against me made it impossible for him to nurse without having his entire face mashed into my breast.  Suffocation is not exactly a positive side effect of breastfeeding.*On the subject of squashing, I never managed to find a happy medium for this thing.  Either we both felt constricted, or it was too loose for me to feel confident wearing it.  My son wasn't, I guess, normal in the constriction department.  Rather than being soothed by swaddling and confining wraps, he would throw an absolute conniption.I think some of our issues may have been worked out with practice, but the thing is so time consuming to put on and arrange, and I was so sweaty and tired after wrestling with the wrap and the baby, plus the wrap at the waist pressed directly into my c-section which was unpleasant for quite some time after I was (per the doctor) healed enough for normal activity, that I just didn't have the patience to keep trying at it.  My baby threw a fit every time he was in it, and that stressed me out completely.  I just didn't have the stamina for this  method.He did like a sling carrier when he was very young.  He was a very long and large baby (22 in at birth), so the sling didn't last long before that started to make him feel constricted as well, and a sling isn't as secure as the moby, which was a drawback for actually accomplishing much in the way of errands and/or chores while wearing the baby... which kind of was the whole purpose.I finally hit on something that did (and does) work for us.  It's a mei tai, or Asian Baby Carrier.  I found a free tutorial online, and it was a screaming success.  I am NOT an accomplished seamstress by any stretch of the imagination, but this was pretty simple construction, and only took a couple hours to put together, one the pieces had been cut.  Hip carry isn't very comfortable for us, but front and back carry are incredibly comfortable.  My husband has 3 ruptured discs in his lower back, and even he can carry our son in the mei tai for short periods.  I can get it on and off in under 2 minutes.  There are no complicated wrappings, twistings, or turnings.  My son's legs are free, and he can get his arms in and out if he wants to, which makes him very happy.  He's content to hang out in the mei tai for longer than I'm content to wear him.  He weighs 30 lbs now, so he's quite a load, but the mei tai lets me carry him with very little effort.  I can even squat, bend (with care, I mean gravity does still work), wash dishes, make the beds, I've even put on my shoes with him in the mei tai with no problems.Of course, everyone is different, so what works for us may not work for someone else, and it seems quite a lot of people love the moby.  We didn't.",1
"Skip Hop Zoo Bib, Dog","I love this bib! It's cute and sturdy, has good coverage, and can be rinsed off easily. I especially love the fact that it has a little flap it can tuck into for traveling.",5
"Summer Infant SwaddlePod 2-Pack, Hungry Caterpillar, Newborn","Nice product, but my baby is still able to get his arms free, as soon as I put him down his arms will be sticking out of the neck hole!  Nice design as the zipper is protected and doesn't irritate his skin.",3
Munchkin Five Sea Squirts,"Soft and playful a very handy size for a toddler. My kid loves these, and carries them around beyond the bath (which can be tricky since they do hold water, so unless I sqeeze them before she carts them off, we end up with little wet spots on everything, but well-worth it!)As soon as she got these, she learned the words for all the animals - great joy for me, since as an ocean-lover, I was mildly vexed that she'd previously failed to take interest in marine life, preferring to stick to farm animals;)",5
NEW*Mud Pie Pretty in Pink Chiffon Rosette Bib Baby Girls Size 11x10,"This is absolutely the cutest bib I have ever seen.  I also bought the matching Mud Pie Rosette Hair band, gown, 2 pc. outfit, and shoes.  It is all so cute and can't wait to see it all on my new granddaughter.",5

Little Bedding by NoJo Dreamland Teddy Bear Mobile,"My daughter goes nuts for the bears and just loves watching them spin. We tried hanging up three hearts on the mobile and left just one bear and she will only look at the one bear! She smiles and laughs every time the music starts! I decided to buy another one for the play pen because she liked it so much, hopefully your daughter will too!",5
"Coverplay Chenille Play Yard Slipcover, Sammy",Product had no instructions. Strange fit as the sides where fabric is without breathing area is to thick.Nice idea though.,2
Thomas &amp; Friends - 3 Piece Dinnerware Set- Pecoware,"I got this for my grandson's birthday. He loves it!!!! In fact, he won't eat off of anything except these dishes. We also got the silverware for him, and he loves it!!!!",5
"Leachco Safer Bather Infant Bath Pad, Blue Fish","Love this product.  It makes bath time much easier.  I'm only giving it one star because it requires a lot of maintenance.  It takes forever to dry.  The only way I can get it dry is to hang it outside in the sun.  Hanging inside takes 2-3 days to dry.  With an infant, it's hard to find time to hang outside and remember to bring back in.  It's sure to mold with the 2 day drying time.  Guess I will be trashing it soon.",1
PumpEase Classic Collection hands-free pumping bra - Verry Cherry - M,"I have Medela Pump 'n Style pump. Initially I was hoping I could use this pump with only one hand but even changing settings on the pump proved to be a challange with one hand, since both are needed to hold the cups over the breasts. This bra changed all of that. I am now able to easily adjust pump settings, eat breakfast, switch tv channels and answer emails on my smart phone. This is just the 15 minutes I would not have otherwise. Great product and absolutely worth the money.",5
Infantino Sash Mei Tai Carrier Black/Gray,"Easy to read instructions, great tushie support and fairly easy to put on. No buckles which is super nice! My little one loves to ride around and see what his mother is getting into. 3 different positions is nice and easy to throw into the washer. Too bad little one can't ride facing out, I really like it and my friend loves it!",5
Playtex Diaper Genie Essentials Diaper Disposal Pail,"We bought this before our son was born, and threw it away before he was three days old. I refused to give it to someone else, and subject them to such a terribly designed diaper pail. At first I was convinced that we were using it incorrectly. I couldn't conceive that someone intended me to stick my hand into a filthy bag to throw away a diaper. The trap door has a lot of resistance, so you really have to push against the diaper to get it in there. It's impossible to keep the area above the trap door clean, and the hole is pretty small, so even if you've managed to keep yourself relatively clean through the diaper change, when you go to throw the diaper away you'll have crap all the way from your hand to your elbow.",1
"Aden by aden + anais 3 Pack Muslin Washcloths, Girls And Swirls","I have been impressed with Aden and Anahi's products. They wash up well and are quality made products. These particular wash cloths are larger so they are tough to use with newborns, will be great for older babies. Would recommend.",5

Munchkin 6 Count Waterproof Changing Pad Liners,"These things are fantastic.  I have 6 for my 3 month old & I got 6 for my mother, who provides childcare for us.  The liners have so many uses & wash well & dry very quickly.  I will be getting these as baby shower gifts for anyone I know going forward.",5
KidCo Magnet Lock Starter Set,"There is another version of this product I bought at Target that is installed using screws & tools.  This product is just as good, and takes mere seconds to install using the sticky pads included in the package.  These locks have kept my 2yo twins out of my cabinets and protected them from the cleaning products under the sink.  GREAT product!",5
Safety 1st Magnetic Locking System,"just about to order another 2 packs.  They use these at my kids daycare and decided if they were good enough for them they should work good for us too.  You cannot upen the door when locked.  Really great idea.  Directions were confusing, so I mounted the door lock first then the cabinet part by eyeing it.  great product- highly recommeneded.",5

Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Home - Replacement Pieces,"I got the Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Home from a friend, it was in good shape just missing a few of the smaller pieces.  The replacement parts fit great and my granddaughter loves to play with the house.",5
"Summer Infant Tiny Diner for Highchairs, Blue","This placemat is easy to carry & use when out & about & has strong suction cups (as long as there's no table cloth underneath). Food can even be placed right on it & the mini well that hangs down in front of your child catches most spills & food. The only drawback is that because the material is flexible & does not lay completely flat because of the design, sometimes bottles/cups may tip over unless placed in the center of the mat,",4
Balboa Baby Adjustable Sling by Dr. Sears - Geisha Trim,"I really wanted to like this sling (after all we spent $60 on it!) but my daughter isn't too fond of it and she squirms around so much that I'm afraid she will fall out (even when using the sling I hold her the same way I would if she wasnt in it so really what's the point?). When she was a very newborn we were able to use it and she didn't mind but at about 4 weeks it was over. I am keeping my fingers crossed that maybe she will come around (she's 4 months) but I think we are going to have to buy a traditional carrier where she can easily see and move her limbs around a bit more freely. Also I think I would feel better having her in something a bit more secure so I can do housework (like vacuuming and laundry) and hold her at the same time. The sling is pretty (we have the black and white one) and I am glad so many people like the sling, it was great when my baby was a newborn.. maybe if we would have put her in it more often she would like it now... I'm also short someone mentioned that it doesn't work as well with short people.(I'm 5'2).Overall, I would get this as a secondary carrier (if you find your baby loves to be bundled and cuddled) because even if your baby doesn't like the traditional one at least you don't have to worry about them squirming their way out of it and potentially harming themselves. Best wishes with your little ones!",3
100% Cotton Terry Contour Changing Pad Cover - Lavender,I am not really impressed with the fabric. It's not soft terry cloth it's cheap terry cloth but for $12.99 I guess I hoped for more. It'll get the job done but I love the chenille fabric better it's soft on my baby's little butt and I'd rather lay her on it than the terry cloth. I do like the variety of colors that the terry cover has to offer.,2
"Fisher-Price Space Saver High Chair, Scatterbug","I love the way that the seat attaches to a chair and the recline is great. It works fine with the tray but I cannot push it up to my table. The arms get in the way and I can't get the seat close enough to the table and she makes a mess. The newer models do not appear to have the pesky arms on them, which I think will solve the problem.",3
"Carter's Keepsake Chest, Meadowlark",this is a very cute box and has plenty of room for all of the little things we brought home from the hospital...,5
"The Shrunks Stepaire Bandit Nap Pad, Orange","I think the concept of this nap pad is great (built in pump, attached blanket, etc.), however, I was not super impressed with the Nap Pad itself. I followed the instructions exactly. I made sure the valve was completely closed. I stepped on the pump the designated 40-50 times, it never inflated. I finally decided to just blow the mat up manually using the small valve on the side. Once I inflated it 75% of the way, I was able to use the foot pump to fill up the rest of the mat. I'm not sure what the deal is, but it definitely didn't inflate using the foot pump alone.The nap mat itself seems to be pretty comfortable. I think it's best suited for a child age 2-3. Otherwise, you'll probably have feet sticking out from the end of the blanket. It was a good size for my three-year-old, but it was almost too short for my four-year-old. The mat and blanket are soft, and I liked that it is easy to roll it up for storage. The built-in pillow is an added plus as well.The main selling feature of the mat is the built-in pump and that was a bit of a disappointment (I tried it, my husband tried it, my son tried it, and none of us had luck inflating the mat using the pump alone.).",3
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"I have been using this for about a month and so far it has been great.  It's pretty basic as far as cameras go, but it has proved to be reliable and the picture and sound quality is better than I could have asked for.  My only complaint is that once the handheld unit gets low on battery, it makes this awful incessant beeping and won't stop unless you turn it off or plug it in.  During the day for naps it's not usually an issue, but at night plugging it in is a definite must.",5
"Thirsties Duo Wrap, Honeydew, Size Two (18-40 lbs)",I've been using these since day 1 on my 7 lb newborn girl in combination with green mountain diaper nb prefolds and a snappi. We haven't had a single leak and it fits perfectly over the diaper. I prefer velcro to snaps.,5

This fits it exactly and came very quickly.,5
"Fisher-Price Kick and Play Piano Gym, Discover 'N Grow","My little man was kicking away at pretty much everything he could and we purchased this for him this week, hoping that he'd enjoy it. And.. he loves it!! The lights and music capture his attention and since he recently began grabbing at things, the dangling toys are exciting for him as well. We also have an activity mat and this piano has quickly replaced that as far as his interest goes, the toys are easier to grab and it gives his kicking legs something to do. He gets a little frustrated when he can't get the toys into his mouth, but that's not a criticism of this gym.. just make sure you have something else close by that your little one can teethe on if you're at that point!! Love this, highly recommend it!!",5
Safety 1st 2 Count Side By Side Cabinet Lock,So fast to open and you get use to it. My toddler can't open but she knows when it's open they need to closed. Very sturdy and nice &#34;snap&#34; close!,5
QuickZip Crib Zipper Sheet - Ecru,"I can't recommend this product enough.  I have twins and these quick-zip sheets are THE BEST.  Along with my mattress pad, I put an additional mattress pad piece under the middle section of the crib and when they have a pee, poop, puke, etc. it is a cinch to unzip the sheet and pull both the sheet top and mattress piece out to wash.  I rarely have to take the mattress out of the crib  and wash the big mattress pad and big sheet(which is a real pain).  This is an amazing product and one of the smartest purchases I have ever made.",5
Sticky Bellies -Sticky Bellies Monthly Milestone Stickers - Oh Sew Ready : Maternity : 12-40 Weeks,"I have a 16 month old and missed out on this super cute photo opportunity, so being we are expecting our 3rd and last I HAD to have these!!! They are super cute and delivery was amazingly fast!!! Thank you so much for helping us create memories!!",5
Jeep Deluxe Changing Pad,"This changing pad is fits well in my Carter's diaper bag and in my handbag when I don't feel like using the diaper bag.It allows me to reach all diaper changing essentials quickly.  At church I don't have to cart off the entire diaper bag to the washroom.  This is like my new purse, so long as  the baby is with me, the jeep deluxe changing pad goes to.  I even stick my keys in the outside pocket.I gave it a four because the inside compartment pockets only allow for a small tube of diaper cream. My small jar cannot fit.",4
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),Its great using instead of your fingers. Use it for my facials whille their mask is drying I apply gently to scalp.,5
"Dr. Brown's BPA Free Polypropylene Natural Flow Standard Neck Bottle, 4 oz - 3-Pack","I bought many of these bottle for my baby, they were good until recently I noticed the paint on the bottle comes off.  This becomes a big concern for us, I have to tripple check the bottle after each wash to ensure the paint doesn't stay in side of the bottles!",2
KidCo Convertible Crib Bed Rail Finish: Natural,"We are more than pleased with this product. A few of the reviews we read, some people were disappointed that the woodwas unfinished. We, however, thought this worked to our advantage as we were able to stain the wood to matchour sons furniture EXACTLY! Not only are we pleased with the color,it's solid wood and very durable, unlike the plastic ones that tend to bend. It is so easy to assemble, and to remove it so you can make the bed is even easier! Overall, this isa wonderful product.",5
"Marvel Spiderman Toddler Bedding Set, Red",My son loved this bedding set.  Th sheets are very soft and are is good quality.  The price was good and I received the package in good time without having to pay extra.,5
Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,Loved this pillow during pregnancy.  The small crook goes nicely under your head while the length of the pillow supports your tummy.  The sleepless nights I had before this pillow almost stopped immediately once it arrived. I just used two pillow cases to cover the pillow rather than spending extra money for a fitted one.,5
"Aden By aden + anais Muslin Swaddle Blanket 4 Pack, Oh My!","I love these blankets. I received them from a friend when my son was born and LOVED them. I used them as a nursing cover (worked much better than my nursing cover), a blanket, and a spit up towel. I give these blankets to all of my pregnant girlfriends even if they aren't on their baby list. Definite must have for a newborn baby.",5
"aden + anais Rayon from Bamboo Swaddle Blanket 3 Pack, Earthly","Super soft, great colors, perfect for my new baby.They do look a little worn after you wash them though.",4
"Combi All in One Activity Walker, Pink",Love this walker. It's really cute and kept my little guy busy with all the toys and music to play with.,5
Earlyears Roll n Swirl Ball Ramp,"The only thing that was cute was that the baby figured out how to put the balls on top and then watch them come down. Other than that, she spent more time pulling them apart because the second one never fit right with the rest. Didn't matter what order they were in the first two never stayed with the bottom three. My 18 month old now uses the balls as shakers instead of using this toy lol.",2
"American Baby Company Heavenly Soft Minky Dot Tailored Crib Skirt, Celery","I normally am not one to be nit-picky, but I ordered the Celery color bed skirt, and it is MUCH lighter than is pictured. It's very pale, and from standing a few feet away, it is not clear that it's supposed to be a green color. The other color options didn't fit with my theme, so I think I will have to keep it. Other than the color, it appears to be of good quality and is nice and long to cover some things I have stashed under the crib. I only took off 2 stars because of the significant color difference than the picture.",3
"Cloud b Twilight Constellation Night Light, Turtle","If I had one complaint, it is that it turns off after 45 minutes. It helps light up the room at night and sometimes when my daughter wakes up she is scared of the dark.",5
"Graco Highback TurboBooster Car Seat, Spitfire","We bought this seat because our three year old was just getting way too big for her convertible car seat. She is in the 95th percentile for both her height and weight, she's only a couple inches shorter than her four year old cousin and she just turned three about three weeks ago. She is way more comfortable and has so much more room to get comfortable. We're taking it on our first long trip this weekend so we'll see how she does. She always hated long trips in her other seat because she was so confined and could barely move. We've had this for a few weeks and so far so good :)",5
"Skip Hop Zoo Pack Little Kid Backpack, Dog",Excelent product. My sister in law uses her with my nephew for about 3 years and it's  in great condittions. Just cleaning and using everytime.,5
"Sassy Baby Changing Pads 36 Count Box, White",Box advertises Absorbent/Soft.  EPIC FAIL!You may as well go to HD and buy the thin plastic they sell. This product is THAT terrible.Paper part is non-existent.Thing rips.They are too small to cover any useful area.For a baby product - it's unusable!Dog?

"Bumkins Flushable Diaper Liner, Neutral, 100 Pack",Grandson has several skin allergies and these really work as described and was happy for that and so was he,5
Medela Nursing Stool,"Do yourself a favor and purchase this item, it will be more helpful to you than any specific nursing pillow.As a first time mother who really struggled with breastfeed I spent a great deal of time in my glider rocking chair working on getting my LO to latch. I was using a kids stepping stool because without it I feet wouldnt touch the ground completely (I'm 5'6). The problem with that stool was it was a flat top and I found myself placing my feet at the edge to  at an angle which was not comfortable if barefoot. In hindsight it was  Also  to high.I made an appt with a lactation nurse because of cracked nipples and problems with latching and she had this or a similar stool. One of my first question was where can I get this? But she didn't know because she had bought it from a closing store in town. My feet rested so comfortably on the stool, at the perfect angle, which supported my posture and helped with my back.After continued struggles at home it dawned on me to Surch the Internet and ofcourse came to find it on Amozon!By the time I purchased it my LO was 2.5months. Feeling more comfortable with nursing I feed her in bed a lot using the laid back aproach (biological nursing?) but when I nurse in a chair/ couch I drag this little baby around because I just can't do without it.Registered or not I now plan on purchasing this for my friends who will be expecting their first baby. It's an item that most people don't know they need!",5

"Philips AVENT Hard Spout Magic Trainer with Handle, 9 Ounce, Twin (Colors May Vary)","These cups are great! Totally leak proof! I always shake it over the sink to make sure I have to valve/spout in correctly though! The handles are removable, and the hard spout is great for breaking the bottle. I will definitly be buying more of these! I just wish you could be 100% sure what color cups you are getting. Since we have a boy I was terrified we would receive the pink ones in the mail, but we got lucky and received the blue & orange ones!My son is 12 months old and can drink out of these without any problems!",5
The First Years - Nursing Privacy Wrap Black,"I ordered this because the picture made it look like it was a larger wrap that covers the whole baby. The material is stiff and might soften up after a few washes, and the wrap is rather short, especially if your baby is a fiesty one like mine. It sort of reminds me of a large skirt with a tie. I have tried to purchase cheaper wraps just to try them out, but now realize that it's best to just get a decent one that covers well even if it's a bit more expensive - I now have 2 useless wraps and I could have put that money together for 1 good one! Live and learn.",3
Graco Ultra Clear Analog Baby Monitor,This works well once you get it on the correct frequencies and get the squeaks out.  It actually is very good for the price.,4
"Graco RoomFor2 Stand and Ride Classic Connect Stroller, Metropolis","This is a great sit n stand by Graco!  Very simple stroller, folds easy and very lightweight for a double.  My only negative is its hard to use the storage basket underneath the seats.  Also hard to strap a diaper bag onto the handlebars because it is in the way of the sitting area.  Not sure those things can be avoided.  All in all it is a very sturdy stroller.  Definitely recommend for anyone with a toddler and infant!",4
"Bumbo Baby Seat, Sitter High Chair - Blue","We picked ours up off a neighbours chuck out pile, luckily, cos the kid never really liked it. We used it maybe 7 minutes altogether & then eventually sold it on ebay for 60 bucks. They seem like a fine idea, and they are for some kids I'm sure, but yes you should try someone else's out before you invest.",3
"North States Supergate Easy Close Metal Gate, White","This product had great ratings already, and for good reason!  It was such an easy installation (even if you aren't a do-it-yourselfer).  Directions were easy to follow, and once the adjustment tweaks are made, it works as advertised.  Gate opens and holds opened both ways.  The auto-close functionality works fantastic, and is by far my favorite feature.  I would highly recommend this product to everyone.",5
Cloud B Tranquil Turtle - Aqua,I bought this for my ten month old. My three year old kept putting it in her room. Finally ordered a second. They are really pretty,5
"BenBat Travel Friends On The Go Head and Neck Support, Chic, 0-12 Months",Fits around her neck perfectly. Love the magnet that helps it to stay put. She still falls forward. Just how hard she sleeps. I added a seat pet to this and it seems to work so far. Nothing can keep her body from falling forward a little but at least she has cushion,5
Amazing Baby Jack in the Box Musical Toy,"I ordered it about three weeks ago. My Grand daughter loves it. Easy for her to play with,and the music is not to loud.",5
"Bright Starts Start Your Senses Safari Activity Gym, Spots and Stripes","My baby loves the stimulation she gets from this play gym, yet I wish the quality of the toys are a bit higher (the mirror is made out of a cheap material that the reflection doesnt work well, for example) and have more interestnig toys dangling. I think the color patterns are awesome.",3
"Fisher-Price 2-in-1 Projection Mobile, Precious Planet","My daughter loves this mobile.  We got it for her to sleep in the crip.  She loves watching her """"movie"""" before going to sleep.  It is super easy to move and take to grandma's house.  Great investment!",5
Summer Infant Dr. Mom Nail Clipper Set,"I would have returned this piece of junk hand it not been for the fact that I was able to fix the smaller nail clipper. It came off the hinge (the part that helps it twist and cut nails), but after an hour of wrestling, I fixed it.For the price, I didn't expect much, but still, I expected some value for the money. I'll just file my baby's nails for now, and use the larger nail clipper when he's older.",1
"OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Pink","We have a ten-month-old. Since the very first day, we have been looking for a wipe container to replace the cheap one comes with the wipes. The only choices we found are wipe warmers. But I don't want the ""warmer"" part. I just need a functional container to replace the flimsy ones that come with the wipes. This one is just perfect for my needs! It looks great and comes with thoughtful design: it has four tiny rubber pads on the bottom to hold it firm on the changing table. The build quality is top-notch. It has a weight plate to hold the wipes in place when you pull wipes out of it. Did I mention it look great? It also has a window to see how much wipe is left. I still keep wipes in the plastic bag, so the window may not be that useful to me. Also I would like it to be on the other side, too. I place the container right next the changing pad. It blocks the window.  But this is a very minor issue to me. I can live with it. Overall, this is must-have for parents.",5

"Dappi Waterproof 100% Nylon Diaper Pants, 2 Pack, White, Small","I used the newborn size for my twins with cloth diapers,  and then I used the size small for my toddler to potty train.  The small were a bit too small for him but he potty trained quick so I didn't bother getting a bigger size. The work great for going the &#34;old school&#34;  route,  but there are definitely better diaper covers out there.  All in all for the style I was satisfied.",4
"NUK Trendline Babytalk Learner Cup, Boy, 5 Ounce",This was the only sippy cup my child would drink out of.  We must have tried 12 different cups and she wouldn't use any of them except this one.  We now have 5 of them and I've purchased the 10 oz ones from NUK too....love them!,5
"Baby Trend Diaper Champ Deluxe, Blue",Any bags work and does same job as diaper genie. I like glad flex kitchen size : scented or unscented. Your choice,5
"Gund Baby Winky Lamb Rattle, White, 4.5&quot;","It's a darling rattle but not sure you would want to leave it with your baby alone. If the baby chewed on it, specks of the little lamb's fur could get stuck in the baby's mouth. But it is adorable.",4
"Summer Infant Sleek and Secure Handheld Color Video Monitor, Grey",I recently bought this camera because my son had gotten a hold of his other one and broke it.  I bought it because a friend of mine has the summer infant model before this one and it seemed like a good camera.  I thought I was getting a step up but the picture does not look very clear.  I emailed the company to see if they had had other complaints about two weeks ago and have yet to recieve a response.  I would say it is not worth the money you pay.,3
Magic Bumpers Portable Child Safety Bed Guard Rail 48 Inch - Set of Two,So far this has been good.  My 2yr old has not fallen once off her daybed.  I would have given it 5 stars if it was covered in a material.  It seems to be just exposed foam.  Which may be the reason it stays put.  Good product.,4
Medela Pump in Style Advanced Backpack,"This pump is fine, I have no complaints about it.  But you might have trouble maintaining supply or it might take too long which is a pain if you are trying to pump at work.  It is just not as strong as a hospital grade pump.  So before you buy this pump from Amazon:1) Ask your insurance company if they will pay for or supply a pump.2) Consider buying a used Medela Lactina from eBay.  Currently they're around $300 shipped and then you need to buy a NEW kit which is around $50 on Amazon and at Buy Buy Baby or $25-30 new on eBay.When I was on maternity leave and was nursing and pumping this pump was excellent.  When I went to work I wished I had bought a used hospital grade pump.",3
"Dr. Brown's Standard Dishwashing Basket, Polypropylene",I bought this product to help with cleaning bottles in the dishwasher since I go through about 28 bottles a day with triplets. This item only holds 3 bottle pieces and it costs more on Amazon than at the store!,1
"Baby Briefcase Baby Paperwork Organizer, Mint/Periwinkle",It keeps all my baby's info in one place. I'm having a second baby and I'm purchasing it for her too. I would only make it a little wider. Other than that is perfect.,4
"Snuza Baby Monitor, Hero",The monitor has put my mind at ease! We have had one false alarm but that was because her diaper was to loose. That just lets me know that it does work!!!,5
iBaby M3 Baby monitor for iPhone,"This monitor has bugs, plenty of them.  It can be an excellent monitor if they work out the bugs.Ive used this monitor for about 15 days wasn't impressed with it.Cons:Takes too long to connect every-time the app is launched.Disconnects randomly(50 Mbps internet speed)Drains your battery.Video quality is not that that greatpros:Easy set up.Works with IOS Devices.Customer Support is good.I can see my son everywhere as long as i have an internet connection.",3
"Mommys Helper Safe Plate Electrical Outlet Covers Standard, White",These covers fit the wall well an are really easy to install. Definitely recommend!! Thank you so much !!!Jf,5
"Fisher-Price Healthy Care Booster Seat, Green/Blue","I have limited space in my eat in kitchen and this seat was a toe saver! I had a large, stand-alone highchair and I kept banging my toes whenever I wasn't paying attention because it took up so much room.  This attaches to my dining chair and slides right under the table.  If it weren't for the straps, you wouldn't be able to tell it was even there.  It cleans up very easily and there are no real places for food to hide or accumulate.  My niece is able to feel like she's sitting at the table with the rest of us, too.  I have also placed it on the floor in the living room so she can have snacks & milk and be somewhat contained.  It's great to travel with when visiting family and friends for dinner and such.  I've also taken it to a few restaurants (not a germaphobe, just like my niece to sit/eat on something I KNOW is clean. Kids can get sick so easy.)",5
North States Supergate Classic Plastic Gate Mounts 5 Different Ways,We installed this on the banister at the top of the stairs. it came with all the hardware needed to mount on a hinge and is relatively easy to install. the installation instructions are helpful and provide accurate measurements on how to mount.Con:the gate is difficult to slide in/out to make shorter or wider.it is very difficult to unlatch the lock once it is in place.,4
Cloud B Twilight Ladybug - Pink,YOU CAN GET IT AT TOYS R US FOR $32.00 FOR STORE PICK UP. ON HERE ITS $40.00 .. :),2
"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Blue/Green/Gray","Works like a charm. Easy to carry, set up, clean. My daughter loves it at 8 months old and our niece loves the booster seat at almost 3. Great purchase.",5
"BOB Ironman Single Stroller, Yellow","I live in Europe and ordered the BOB Ironman stroller from the states as I don't seem to be able to get it over here. The Amazon price was acceptable and delivery was fantastic. I received the stroller in just two days.Assembly was unproblematic. I have not had to deal with aligning the stroller yet, as the alignment has so far been correct.My daughter was five months old when I bought the stroller and started using it for walking around parks and in town. It is very easy to push and rolls very smoothly, even on cobblestones and gravel paths. Of course, the baby bumps around a bit, but no more so than in a normal stroller, and maybe even less because of the springs.I have since used the stroller once for a very slow jog (my husband was walking next to me) on a paved, fairly straight path around a lake and that worked great. It's slightly more difficult than running without a stroller, but the luxury of having your baby with you and being able to jog when it fits your schedule and not being dependent on someone being home with the baby more than makes up for it.The stroller folds up very easily. I can collapse the stroller in seconds (both hands are required) and open it equally fast, even one handed. I line the seat with additional blankets because the fabric is rather utilitarian and not very cozy on baby's head. We have a very small hatchback (Smart for four) and I can only get the stroller in the back seat. It's too wide for the trunk, but I haven't tried it without the front wheel. As is, there is only room for the driver, a passenger, and the baby in the car seat in back next to the stroller.I do not have the car seat adapter but the baby rides well in the stroller. It can recline quite far and even when jogging I didn't have a problem with my knees hitting the back. The reclining feature itself is rather primitive, as it's only adjusted by straps which suspend the back from the frame, so there is little support - not like a bouncy seat - more like a stiff hammock, but it works. As the baby gets older and the seat can be adjusted higher, I think I will like it better.Overall I am thrilled by the freedom the stroller provides and I look forward to using it for the next couple of years. I recommend it to all joggers and wish it were more readily available on the European market.",5
Leachco Prop 'R Shopper - Shopping Cart Cover - Sage Pin Dot,This works great but the main Velcro that attaches around the cart handle will not work with every cart type.,4
Baby Luv Nightlight and Music Turtle and Animals (Black and White),"My grannies spend the week with me every other month and I love having new and exciting things for their vists. Well on their last night with me I gave them the Baby Luv nightlight . It is so much fun to see the stars and moon on the ceiling.And the music was nice too. We laughed and played till the girls fell asleep. They are 2 and 4 years old, I even sent one to my daughter in Afghanistan she told me to get her a night light that showed stars.I know she will love it too.",5
"Boppy Pillow with Brocade Slipcover, Black and White","I had babysat for a friend, watching her 1 month old son and borrowed her Boppy pillow. I was able to fall asleep on it that evening when he refused to sleep in his bassinette. Had to purchase one for myself!  Love the cover that is pale and gender neutral.",5
(1) Cresci Products Window Wedge (2 Per Pack) WHITE color,These do just what I wanted-keep my second story double hung windows from opening more than 4 inches.  Easy to install.  I have not had any problems with them.,4
"DaVinci Reagan 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","Bought this as a gift for our daughter.  It went together very easy, and it looks beautiful and of good quality.",5
Leachco Easy Teether - Crib Rail Cover - White,This product worked really well for us.  After trying 3 other crib railing protectors we finally found this one and it's getting the job done.  Our 13 month old has learned to paritally unvelcro part of it but overall it's getting the job done (a little too late though since our entire crib rail already has teeth marks)!,4
Circo&reg; Crib Dust Ruffle - Multi Dots,I am having a grandson and grandaughter born in the same month.  Works great for a nursery for both of them.,5
"Bunnies by the Bay Buddy Blanket, Skipit",A good companion for my daughter. She attached to the bigger version as her blankie so now we have the buddy to go with it.,4
"Bella Tunno Ribbon Loop Binker Pacifier Clip, Ocean Stripes/Blue Hawaiian Stripes",Very misleading!  There is only one clip in the package.  I should have read previous reviews and I would have known there is only one clip in the package.  Otherwise the product is nice but not worth $8.,1
Hand Held Scalp Head Massager - Set of Three ( Colors May Vary ),"I was a bit leery of purchasing because of the low price, but I'm glad I decide to go ahead and purchase, because these head massagers are awesome!! I wanted to get a scalp massager to increase blood circulation and stimulate hair growth. They seem pretty sturdy and well made; the ends softly massage your scalp (I've had some that were too pointy and harsh). Will definitely recommend to my friends and family",5
Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Rusty the Robot Take Along Toy,My bb loves it! I can't go out of the house with out... It's my 6 months old best buddy!,5
"Graco Sweet Slumber Sound Machine, White","I plan to return this product if possible as the sounds that it produces were, for my husband and myself, more irritating than soothing.",1
"Kalencom Midi Buckle Bag, Calypso","Love the colors, fabric and interior. Only con is the size. Would've liked it to be bigger. I never seem to have enough room for everything I need on the go.",4
"Tiny Love Gymini Bouncer, Blue/Yellow",bought the other color for my son and it is wonderful and he loves it. bought this one for a baby shower(girl) and had a horrible time putting this one together. and to top it off it didn't have one of the toy ring holders on it .. like I said for a baby shower and didn't have time to return it...was disappointed that this one wasn't like the first one I bought.,3
"HALO SleepSack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Print Boy, Large","The Halo SleepSack 100% Cotton SleepSack Wearable Blanket is adorable and functional... not to mention safe!  I received one to review and I love it!  My little guy has to be one of the world's worst about kicking the blankets off, getting cold, and then waking up.  He has also now reached the age where he grabs everything with his hands and pulls it immediately toward his face.  With the Halo SleepSack 100% Cotton SleepSack Wearable Blanket I don't have to worry that he will pull the blanket up by his face during the night while I am sleeping and being at risk for suffocation.  With the zip on design, he can't kick it off of him so I don't have to worry about him constantly kicking off the blankets and getting cold and then waking up!!  Each one has special ""Back Is Best"" embroidery to remind parents and caregivers that little ones should all sleep on their backs to help reduce the risk of SIDS! They have several new designs that are absolutely gorgeous!  They are all 100% cotton. They offer selections for boys, girls, and neutral colors!  Halo has thought of everything to help keep your baby warm and safe throughout the night.  I definitely give this product and Halo itself two thumbs up!",5
Safety 1st Heavenly Dreams White Crib Mattress,"The mattress is perfect. It not only seems to be high quality, but comfortable and safe. I was happy with the quality and cost",5
"Britax Kick Mats (2-Pack, Black)","This lasted one 25 minute trip before it began to tear along the top seam. We bought it, not because our son kicks, but because his legs are getting long enough to touch the seat back and therefore get it dirty. It was not subjected to any kicking, just him putting his feet on the seat back. I expect more from a brand of this caliber.",1
Munchkin Click Lock Fresh Food Freezer Pops,"These freezer pops aren't overly big so they are perfect for my little man (8 months). The grasper is nice and wide, easy for his hands. I think each pop is only 2 oz which is just right for his appetite right now. I like to use them when his mouth hurts from teething.",4
Snuza Portable Baby Movement Monitor,"We love this thing.  We used the Angel Care with our first son and hated to load it up for spend the night trips to the grandparents.  The Snuza does everything we need it to do while being easily portable.  I use it on long car trips also.  I will say, the alarm isn't super loud.  I don't know if it is louder on the other models.  If baby is in your room it may be a problem.  If you are listening over a monitor then just turn the volume up.",5
"Summer Infant Quickchange Portable Changing Pad, Black","I got this for my daughter, who says it is very well made, and serves the purpose.",5
"Munchkin Quick Install 26&quot; Gate, Black","I bought this gate to block the stairs from my 8 month old grandson.  The gate is very easy to put in place and remove.  You can do it with just one hand, which is really important because I am often holding the kid when I need to go up stairs.  Very reasonably priced. We are very happy with this gate.",5
"Skip Hop Bath Spout Cover, Moby","We love this spout cover.  Yes, we have the shower diverter but that is not what keeps it on.  We have a standard sized spout and it stays on just fine.",5
Baby Leg Warmers (Marshmellow),Love these for my baby girl!  Now that she's crawling everywhere they help protect her knees too.  The color is neutral enough that I've paired these with anything from navy to green outfits.  She loves them and looks totally adorable in them.,5
"DaVinci Kalani 4-in-1 Convertible Crib with Toddler Rail, Cherry","This crib is very well made and the wood feels very sturdy.  It's fairly easy to put together assuming there are two of you to do it.  It does scratch kind of easy, but don't think any less than any other wood.  It will be interesting to see how it holds up over the years.",4
Meeno Baby Cool Me Seat Liner Stroller - Baby Blue,"Not sure how much &#34;cooling&#34; it does, but it certainly wicks away the moisture from baby on a hot day and keeps him dry. Super easy to install and clean, which is always a plus. Fits well in the JJ Cole Broadway stroller. Added an extra layer of plush comfort to the stroller seat, which baby seems to like. I would definitely buy this again.",4
"Itzy Ritzy Snack Happens Reusable Snack Bag, Rodeo Drive",These bags are great! It was bigger than expected but it's perfect for lunches and picnics. The're even washing machine safe.,5
KidCo BabySteps Electric Food Mill - White,I was a little disappointed in this product. It didn't seem to puree the food enough for my baby to eat. It ended up being more work then helpful!,3
"Quinny 2012 Buzz Stroller, Rebel Red","I did a lot of research before buying this stroller.  I am loving it...  It is so easy to handle and steer.  Most people reviewed that the sun canopy was pathetic but I think they changed it on the new buzz as I find it works wonderfully.The buzz box is not a shopping basket but it really is nice as I can put my keys and cell phone away safely and walk to the parks without stressing about it laying on the tray, like my previous pram.It is really nice looking and I have attached the buggyboard for my 3yr old to stand at the back and the pram is very sturdy it does not fall over and it is still easily manoevered with him standing on.I love the fact that the chair is reversible.It is expensive but I was looking for a high level stroller and yes it could have come with a shopping basket and a cup holder but i knew these things before I purchased it so not too perturbed about that.Overall it really is lovely and yes I would recommend it.",4
Tupperware Bell Tumbler Sippy Cups with Seals Set of 4,"love these cups, the only downfall would be that they are difficult to get the lid on the first few times, but item was shipped and received quite quickly.",5
The First Years American Red Cross Deluxe Baby Healthcare and Grooming Kit,"I gave this as a gift to my sister.  She was very pleased.  That makes me happy.  Being a mom of 5, myself, I thought it was a well put together kit of all the essentials.",5
Graco imonitor Vibe 2 Parent,"Not dependable.  We are probably on our fifth one that we've returned and replaced.  We've only kept getting it as we were stuck with it from a registry and didn't want to fork out more money for a different one. Our issues: lots of static, constantly flaking out between the red warning light (off) and being on, one parent monitor went completely dead although it ""looked"" ok with the green light, and overall, just sporadic use.  Many evenings we'd sit and turn it on and off every few minutes just to make sure the baby was ok, otherwise if left on long term, it would beep with the red light which meant it wasn't working.On the good side, it does have a long range.Overall, don't buy unless you want a unit that you'll have to return or one that will flake out on you within a couple months.",1
Kids Preferred Amazing Baby Blanket Teether Bear,"my wife bought this for my baby boy, he absolutely loves it. there's some material inside the body that crinkle and crackle when he plays with it. the hands are awesome for biting/teething. the feet dangle some loops and make squirt sounds when he squeezes them. he enjoys it in the car ride to daycare. easily one of his favorite toy (he's 9months now).",5
WubbaNub Brown Puppy,The only pacifier my son could keep in his mouth when he was little.  I now give them to all my friends as shower gifts.,5
"South Shore Furniture, Sweet Morning Collection, Changing Table, Royal Cherry",We bought this for our first baby and the size of this changing table is nice. One small issue is we thought that the drawers will be bigger but they are smaller. Took a lot of time to assemble but final product is nice.,4
Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Bouncer,"This is my favorite bouncer.  My daughter was mesmerized by it from the very beginning.  At 3 months she still stares at the fish swimming about.  The vibration feature is great to relax and lull your little one to sleep.  The only negative thing I can comment on is the motor is a little loud, but not enough for me not to love the product.  I especially love the variety of music and nature sounds.  The Ocean Wonders line is truly ""wonderful""!",5
"Innobaby Packin' SMART Formula Dispenser and Snack Case - Lemon Frosting, iParenting Media Award Winner for Best Products 2007","This is a great product; easy to use, clean, and dispense.  I've used other formula dispensers in the past but like this one so much better.  If we're going on a short trip, I just stack a couple.  If we're going to be gone for a while, I stack all five.  Looking forward to using it for snacks later as well.  Definitely worth the cost!",5
Chicco KeyFit &amp; KeyFit30 Infant Car Seat Base - Anthracite,Needed another base for my husbands car. Worked out beautifuly!!!Would recommend this to anyone who is using the Chicco travel system!!,5
"Cocalo Removable Wall Appliques, A to Z Boy",Very cute and can be reapplied and moved around.  They haven't caused any damage to my painted walls (as of yet) and they've all stayed up so far (had them for about 2 months now).,5
"Pura Stainless Kiki Infant Bottle Stainless Steel, 11 Ounce, Natural","I wanted an alternative to plastic, but unfortunaly these bottles made me never wanna look at stainless steel again. There may be other good stainless steel bottles out there, but these are not it.Pros:Have not found one yet.Cons:bottle leaks, for two reasons; one is that the top does not screw on well, and second, the way the nipple fits into the top is not well fitted, leaving space for liquid to escape.awful metallic smell, which will not wash awaythe nipple, thought it indicates to be a step one nipple for newborns, has too fast of a flow.Poor ergonomic on the bottle, so it is not comfortable to hold or feed with.Also my baby did not like the shape of the nipple, though this is subjective.Since there are much better alternative, I do not recommend these bottles.Dr. Browns, glass bottle have been wonderful. Great nipple shape, slow flow, colic prevention,comfortable grip and no leaks.",1
"Eddie Bauer Harness, Girl Monkey","This was just the cutest little thing ever.  Never thought I'd put my kid on a 'leash', but when you have a toddler who thinks she's 10 and refuses to sit in a stroller, this is great.  Soft, cute and the tail comes off so my daughter can use it as a backpack or play with it and not worry about choking.  So cute!  Great product!",5
Babies 'R' Us Auto Sensor Night Lights - 2 Pack,I don't really have any complaints and they do what they are supposed to do. Inexpensive and worth every penny.,3
"Boppy Pillow with Luxe Slipcover, Monkey","As a breastfeeding mom, I couldn't live without my boppy. This boppy is very soft and quite comfy!  It is also nice for tummy time.",5
"Lifefactory Sippy Caps for 9-Ounce Glass Beverage Bottles, Set of 2, Raspberry and Royal Purple","I'm a huge fan of glass drinking containers and it is quite hard to find them in kid-friendly options.  That said, the mouth piece of this is not my favorite.  I would love for Lifefactory to make some more drinking / mouth piece options for their otherwise wonderful and safe sippies  and water bottles.  I would make the same comments about their adult versions.  How about something that school-aged kids can easily use?",4
"JJ Cole Car Seat Cover, Khaki",,5
Gerber Graduates Kiddy Cutlery 3 Piece Spoon Set,"My son will only use metal utensils, since that is what the rest of family uses.  These are great.  Easy to grip, dishwasher safe, and fun colors.",4
"Playtex Insulator/Playtime Cup, 9 Ounce, Colors May Vary","For those of you with toddlers, I wanted to recommend this sippy cup. I literally went through probably 10 brands of sippy cups and hated them all. And, my daughter just didn't seem to drink a lot from them. I read some reviews and found out about this one and tried it and absolutely love it. I literally bought 6 of them and threw all the other ones out (well, donated). There are three main reasons why I love this cup:1. It does NOT spill, I swear2. The parts are easy to take apart, clean, and put back (some other ones had a million tiny parts that were hard to put back together).3. It is insulated to keep liquids cold without being heavy at all. And, there is no condensation so diaper bags, etc don't get all wet.",5
Evenflo Snugli Comfort Vent Carrier,"I have a 4yr old, 3 yr old and 20 month old.  I purchased this when my second child was born so I could carry him and keep up with my 15 month old.  my second loved being held, so this helped tremendously, especially if we were going to be out with out a stroller.  and my older son loved it too!  When I had my third my oldest was only 2 1/2 so to keep my sanity we had to get out of the house, but I wasn't quite up to the task of an infant, toddler and one walking toddler,nor was I about to spend several hundred dollars on a thriple stroller to use for such a short period of time,  so I buckled the two older kids up and put my youngest in this (Which stayed in the basket when not in use).  This is absolutly the best investment I have ever made in any baby product (and I've made quite a few :)) It's a great buy too $20!",5
"Britax Roundabout Convertible Car Seat Cover Set, Onyx","We replaced our old blue all cloth cover with this one when my third child was born--the material is quality and easier to clean than the last....(perfect if you let the kids eat in the car) it looks like new again-LOVE the """"new"""" look!",5
"BRICA UV Alert Window Shade, Gray","My house faces west and in the afternoon you can hardly touch the front door.  The door has a window and I couldn't find anything to cut down the heat from that window until I found this Brica Window Shade.  It is a little smaller than the window but does a great job of cooling down the area inside the front door.  It has been sticking for the last 4 days with no slippage.  It is a little too big for my car, but I bought some other shades for those side windows.  I am including a picture of what it looks like.  I love it!",5
Hohner Kids Baby Band,10 month old Son loves to shake these and hear the sounds they make. They get thrown around a lot too and have held up well.,5
Marvel Comics Spider-Man Toddler Plush Blanket - Spiderman Webslinger Toddler Size Bed,My 3 year old son absolutely loves this blanket! He can't take a nap or go to bed without his blanket.,5
"Graco High Back TurboBooster Car Seat, Fairy Tales","my three year old daughter loves sitting in this big girl chair. Car rides are a lot more fun and it really makes her feel independent to be able to climb in and out by herself. She even buckles her own seat belt! The seat belt holds her in very securely, the cushioning is comfortable, and it is not as narrow as other ones she tried to sit in. Overall, good buy --good safety features, comfy , PINK, and good price.",5
"Evenflo Tribute 5 Convertible Car Seat, Ella","This is a good quality, very nice car seat. This is the second one like this we bought as we like it so much!",5
Mommy's Helper Contoured Cushie Tushie Potty Seat,My son loves this seat. He feels like a big boy when he gets to use the big potty all by himself. I put the hook for the seat so he can get to it on him own and so this is ideal for him and it is nice because I don't have to wash out a little potty chair. The only thing that would make it nicer is if it had handles. Not a big deal at my house because the toliet is close to a wall so he uses that for support but I think it would make him feel more secure. I would recommend this for anyone with a child who wants to use the big potty.,4
Infantino Food Press,I bought the Infantino Squeeze Station and wanted an extra press. This press doesn't even match the other press. The other press is clear. I wouldn't have bought it.,1
"Britax Advocate 65 CS Click &amp; Safe Convertible Car Seat, Onyx","I bought this product after researching it for a awhile,I have another child who is 5 and is in her Britax Marathon and I love that car seat. The Advocate is a very good quality product and very safe. Don't be scared away by the extra padding on the side it's not but a couple inches more wide. I have a Britax Marathon right next to this one and they fit perfect with enough room for the person sitting on the other side...I know it's a little high price wise but your child will have it for a long time and the safety from this seat is worth it alone.",5
Wimmer Ferguson Wimmer Infant Stim Mobile To Go,"At about 6 weeks my grandson really started loving this.  Mom clipped it to an existing mobile, with the clip it is pretty versatile.  I would highly recomment it, especially for the price..",5
"BRICA Stay-In-Place Baby Mirror, Black",I was hesitant based on other reviews but bought it anyway.  I love it.  I just clip it to the visor in my truck and can clearly see my little one in the back seat now.  Soo much better and safer than pulling down my rear view mirror.,5
"Luvable Friends 4-Pack Flannel Receiving Blankets, Blue",These blankets were a part of a baby shower gift.  They were so cute.  The material is pretty good.  Nothing amazing but not to cheap.  Shipped fast.,5
Baby Einstein Caterpillar and Friends Play Gym,My son is not quite old enough to get the full effect of this toy and leaning center but I expect once he grasps it he will have fun for months to come.  It's everything I expected it to be so I am very happy.,5
"Nuby Easy Clean Bottle Brush with Suction Base, Colors May Vary","I love the idea of the suction cup--when you put it down so the bristles are not touching the countertop.  Also, I like the little nipple brush snuggled in the handle.  The one thing I could do without is the sponge part. The sponge slides around the handle a little, and I feel like sponges hold germs more and are more difficult to keep clean than the bristles.",4
KidCo Peapod Plus - Kiwi,"We have two kids who have used the pea pod tents for the last two years.  They are fantastic.  We have packed both in a large duffle with extra room for clothes on both long drives and flights.  These truly have become our kids second beds away from home - and sometimes at home.  We never have trouble getting them to sleep anywhere new because these are their spots.  We started out using them for play when I thought they were too little to sleep in them, and then at a year we transitioned the tents from play into beds no problem.  We take them everywhere - all of our vacations, hotels, camping (in our larger tent), etc.  We actually use one for my three year old who still needs to nap, but if given the chance will get out of her toddler bed and not sleep.  These have been a life saver.  I am jumping on now to buy a third for the next kid.  Can't recommend enough!  Just make sure the baby is big enough to rollover, crawl, etc. to be safe.",5
BRICA Baby In-Sight Magical Firefly Auto Mirror for in Car Safety,"It didn't worked for us I think the mirror is to small and after moving the mirror around for almost a week, we really can't see the baby.",1
Sassy Soft Cushion Play Space Interlocking Mats,This is very small.  My 5 month old rolls right off of it.  I had this on my baby registry so we got it for free and that I am thankful for but i would not recommend this to anyone.  The foam is thick so that is good but the shapes don't stay flat if your child takes them out and puts them back together a lot like my nieces do.Off to buy an alphabet mat now.,3
"Bobo Buddy Baby Pacifier Holder Plush Toy, Caterpillar",I like this product for use with a different type of passified but my son loves his WannaNub Monkey and Giraffe better.,3
"aden + anais Classic Muslin Crib Sheet, Up, Up &amp; Away Elephant","The material is exactly what you would expect from Aden + Anais - incredibly soft and breathable.  The colors are just as shown in the picture, keep in mind that the fabric makes it a little sheer so you will want to get a white mattress pad cover.  I washed once before putting on my crib and it held up well.  Fits a Pottery Barn standard mattress.",5
"Manhattan Toy Beads Wood Rattle, Classic",I was looking for another sensory toy and found this at pottery barn.  Was way cheaper on Amazon and my son really likes it.  I put it around his wrist or ankle and he shakes or kicks it.,5
"Fisher-Price Newborn Rock 'n Play Sleeper, Yellow",Product appears in good shape and arrived on time. Cannot specify how well it works since it is a gift but price was better than other places.,5
"Bright Starts Rattle and Shake Barbell Rattle, Pretty in Pink",So I paid to have this item gift wrapped(more money) and it DID NOT happen!!!!!!!!! What a waste of money and time.. Lesson learned don't pay to have this done by this company.........,1
Cutie Pie Holiday Baby Bibs 10/pk,The bibs were clearly advertised as holiday bibs.  What I received were a package of 10 bibs; 5 with holiday designs and 5 with no decoration whatsoever.  This was not what I expected.,3
Toy Storage - Chain Gang (White) (6' L),It is just a simple chain... but it help me decluttered my daughter's room in minutes.,5
"babyletto Madison Swivel Glider, Mocha","This is the 3rd item I've purchased from Babyletto.  The first was a crib, next a drawer set, and now the glider.  I like the modern look of their items for a reasonable price.  Unfortunately, this company has a huge problem with their packaging.  All three of these items were delivered in very poor conditions: broken and chipped pieces and torn up packaging.  This last time, I simply told UPS that I could not accept the glider because the box was completely destroyed.  It's too bad Babyletto has this problem because their baby furniture is very nice.",3
Star Kids Snack and Play Travel Tray,"It works, it's not as stable as it looks, but that probably depends on the carseat & the child. It did it's job though!",4
Bright Blossoms One size Adjustable Cloth Diaper double hip snaps 6pcs Pack Fitted Pocket Washable with 6 Inserts,"I initially was not sold on the idea of cloth diapers. The cleaning, and time involved seemed to be semi-hassle. However, I am now a fan after using the pocket diapers for about a year. I have tried different brands that have similar properties. Lets start off, not all cloth diapers are made with the same quality even if they have the same prints or colors.I have tried brands like baby city, baby land, and oh baby ka. Those are less in price but the quality is not the same. The material is not as good nor is the craftsmanship. Anyhow, I like this cloth diapers because for the price they give a comfortable fit for our baby and we combine the inserts 2 pieces hemp cotton and one microfiber. They work well and we have saved tons of $ on diapers and saving the environment is always a plus. The designs are nice our grandson will point to the animals on the diaper print. The snaps are easy to configure and pocket elastic on the top helps hold in the insert. Also it's been a year and the diapers still hold together very well definitely can go round 2 for the second child.",5
Infantino Sync Comfort Wrap Carrier Black/Red,There is lots of material. The concept is great but too time consuming. My opinion is Ergo is the way to go!,1
"Leachco Snoogle Loop Contoured Fit Body Pillow, Ivory",I really like this pillow. I can't sleep on one side for the whole night so I was looking for a pregnancy pillow that didn't need to be re-adjusted every time I turn over.  This pillow supports my back and my hips. The only down side is it doesn't really support my belly all that well.  I have to use another pillow for that.,5
"Skip Hop Central Park Outdoor Blanket, Chevron","The purse that can be zipped to the blank is convenient to keep car keys and small purse.  You should keep the packaging until you have memorized how to fold back into the messenger bag.  Love how handy it is to use when I want to watch a soccer game and sit next to the field, hang out on the beach or park if I do not want to bring a chair.  Easy to clean since plastic on one side and hard canvas on the other side.",4
"Peg Perego Convertible Infant to Toddler Car Seat, Black","I tried 3 other car seats in the rear facing mode and this is the only one that fit. It fits well in all of our family vehicles including grandmas and in the rental car we had on vacation. People in the front seat don't have to have their knees jammed into the dashboard to keep this seat in the proper position. Once I found a convertible seat that would actually fit in my car, I was concerned about how well my very tall baby would fit in it. He out grew the infant car seat when he was 6 months old and now at 15 month he still has lots of room for growth, and I doubt we'll have any issues with leg room before he turns two. It is well made with lots of padding for my little guy. I like that the seat doesn't block his view. The straps are easily adjustable and very easy to loosen when taking him out. The straps occasionally sticks when trying to tighten but not enough to be a real problem.This seat meets all of the US and European safety standars that was a plus for me. I couldn't find this car seat locally and the seller on Amazon doesn't ship to my location so I had it shipped to my moms and paid an additional $150 to have it shipped here. It was still worth the extra cost.",5
"Sumersault Pop Dot 10 Piece Crib Set, Tan/Green/Orange","Love it. The bedding is adorable. We bought it for our son's nursery- and didn't use all the pieces that came in the bag, but really liked it. It is nice because it has color to use for other inspiration for the bedroom. Really happy with our purchase :) Recommend to anyone !",5
"Eddie Bauer Sport Stroller, Blue Glacier","The only thing good about this stroller this that it is light weight. THATS ALL!!!! Its caps on the back wheels kept falling off so my husband put superglue on them to stay on. The parent tray is too small only fits 1 bervage/bottle. The side rails dont have any protective covering, so my 9 month baby girl ended up hitting her head on it. Looks nice but not a good buy!!!!!!!!",3
"JJ Cole Original Infant Bundleme, Apple, Infant","I bought two of these a light blue one and a light pink one when my twins were infants.  I wished I had known about these when my other two children were little.  Speaking as a mother of four and of multiples, these were the best investment ever.  The bottom stays in the bottom of the infant carrier and the top zips onto it.  This was so convenient and nice and warm for the baby.  I did purchase the hats too but they were too small so if you do not have a newborn do not invest in these.  My twins were born in May they were tiny but the hats didn't fit that fall.  I love these and tell everyone that's  having a baby about these.",5
Pearhead Babyprints Photo Frame,"I must say that although the first time this product arrived the glass was broken, exchanging it was very easy and we are very pleased with the product. The frame is very sturdy, the overall quality of the piece is high and it is just plain cute! I hesitated buying it because so many people said they had shipping problems and even though I did as well, I am still glad I ordered it because Amazon made it very easy to exchange the broken one and it looks absolutely perfect in our nursery!",4
"Graco Lauren Classic Crib, Espresso",I ordered this crib for my son. I LOVE LOVE this crib. It is perfect. Well built & very nice. Looks great in the nursery. Would recommend!,5
Jolly Jumper Stroller Caddy - Stroller Handlebar Organizer,This works great with our UB Vista - my only issue is the obnoxious Jolly Jumper logo that stares to in the face. Easy to assemble and I'm able to open & close my stroller without having to continuously remove it.,4
"Wallstickersusa Wall Stickers, Santa is It Too Late To Be Good","I loved the look, it was very cute. I am only giving 3 stars, though, because the letters are very thin. I tore 2 while removing from the backing, despite being careful. Most of the letters tore when removing from the wall, making it one use only.",3
"Britax Marathon Convertible Car Seat, Granite","we love this car seat. i was afraid it would be too big, but fits in our prius and even in our beetle if the front seat is pushed forward. its easy to install although its heavy to carry.we got it for $[...] plus free shipping at travelingtikes.com. I saw that in another review here and was so glad because its such a great deal. they only have certain fabrics at this price. we got the zebra and love it.",5
Summer Infant Sure And Secure Expansion Gate,"We had this gate for 1 year before it just recently broke.  We knew it wasn't the best, but there are VERY few gates to cover 70 in.  The anchors it came with were plastic, so my husband used anchors rated for over 100 pounds so the weight of the gate wouldn't pull out of the wall.  That wasn't what broke.  The chinsy little plastic mechanism it swings on is what broke.  Also, the gate does not contract within itself when you open it, so it takes alot of space to clear in the room.  The closing latch starting sticking several months ago.  We put off replacing the gate because there are so few options for that large of a doorway.",2
Lamaze Soft Chime Garden Musical Toy,"This was a Christmas gift for my daughter when she was two-months-old. At the time, it was one of the few toys she really had any interest in. She's now nine-months-old and still enjoys this toy. I have to say that I think I enjoy playing with it even more than she does. The setting with individual chimes instead of songs is fun to mess around with. My daughter enjoys the different songs that the other settings play. This is a really neat toy and doesn't become annoying as many infant toys do.",5
New Boba Wrap in Red with Matching Carrying Pouch : Infant Baby Carrier : Preemie - 18months (Previously Sleepy Wrap),"This is a must have! Extremely comfortable and my baby loves being snuggled close to me. It does get a bit warm, but I expected that as my baby is right up against me.",5
Sassy Baby Food Pantry Organizer,"Loved this organizer! Takes up a small footprint on the counter and I was able to keep all my daughters food sorted and organized. As she got older and had more of a selection, I P-touched the rows to state breakfast, lunch, dinner, fruits, and veggies. It was helpful when I had someone else watching her as they would know what to feed her.  It was also helpful at a quick glance to know exactly what I was low on and needed to replenish.  Would definitely buy and recommend to a friend. I used this for Earth's Best Baby Food and all stages fit well.",5
Nest Diaper Bags Grommet (Toffee),I love it. it's really very well done but a bit to wide for me. But I don't think it's a big problem it should be rather spaceful for my and baby staff. Anyway the leather is so soft and have a zipper pocket that you can take off and wear this bag as a usual one.,4
Tommee Tippee Explora Li'l Sippee Trainer Cup 2pk 7-12 Months 10 Ounces - Girls (Colors/styles May Vary),I ordered purple and pink but received yellow and blue. I was very angry but decided not to deal with return. I went to Amazon and wrote a review that was deleted the next day.My second review was deleted without a reason too! BEWARE!,1
Sock Ons Clever Little Things That Keep Baby Socks On! 6 - 12m (Turquoise),"terrific!  wish we had these with our son.  our daughter is 19 months, and we still use them because she likes to pull off her socks all the time.  we've never had a problem with them not fitting as one of the reviews mentions.  they are fabulous!",5
Lansinoh Manual Breast Pump,"I'm amazed.  I wanted to buy an electric pump, which all my friends recommended, but decided to give this one a try, and I'm happy I did.  Such a saving compared to electric pump!  And it's very convenient and pretty quick.  Easy to assemble, easy to wash, easy to use.  Just great!",5
"Carter's Forest Friends Wall Decals, Tan/Choc","These wall decals are a fast and easy way to add some cute art to your baby's room. My six year old son actually did most the placement of these in his little brother's room, they are virtually impossible to mess up and he was so happy to help get ready for the baby. The package came with enough decals for us to make a main mural and then place some animals, mushrooms, and acorns above the changing table and a shelf in the room. The images and colors would be great for a boy r girl's room and are not too babyish that they would want them removed until they get much older. We also purchased the matching canvases witht he owl and fox and they look great in the room with the murals.",5
Uncle Goose Chinese Character Blocks (32 pcs),"I bought these Chinese blocks for the three boys (3 y.o. and under) that I nanny for. The first time we opened the box and began to play, the 3 y.o. said, &#34;These are our favorite!&#34; over and over. The blocks have been a hit ever since. They love learning the number and animals. We haven't gotten to writing the characters yet, but I am excited to teach them that. Also, the pieces can be put together to form a map of China, the Chinese flag, a dragon and the word for China in English and Chinese.The couple things that I would say as a &#34;negative&#34; about these blocks would be that the edges are not rounded, so they can hurt if they are thrown across the room. Also, there is pinyin (pronunciation system) for the animals on the blocks, however there is no pinyin provided for the numbers. Thankfully, I know Chinese, so I am able to help them with that.(For anyone who would like to know how to pronounce the numbers, I recommend getting the free app called &#34;Pleco.&#34; Just type anything in and there is a button you can push to hear the pronunciation.)Overall, a mostly perfect buy for my 3 boys. Great fun and great for learning!",5
"Mommys Helper Cushie Traveler Folding Padded Potty Seat with Carry Bag, White with Frog Design","I was hesitant to buy it due to some of the negative feedback about these folding seats, but if you use the seat properly, you will never have a problem.The seat is to be placed towards the absolute back of the host toilet seat - this reinforces the back fold and prevents any sort of collapse.  Follow the directions and you will be just fine.  Makes even the shadiest of public toilets bearable.The included carry bag is great for keeping germs where they belong.",5
American Baby Company Quilted Fitted Waterproof Fitted Cradle Mattress Pad Cover,"Perfect fit, nice thickness, plush, exactly as described.  Used in a jenny lind cradle.  The mattress is not plush at all, so this cover adds the extra softness that baby needs.",5
,"We have an open floor plan where our living room meets the kitchen. This left a huge gap between the walls that a conventional gate would never cover. This gate was super easy to install with a drill. Instructions were clear, but would recommend keeping them somewhere for later reference in case you have to reinstall in a new home or area. Its very sturdy and our little boy cant figure out as well as some of our visitors! Pretty entertaining to watch adults try to get past it. Once you know how to open it correctly though its easy.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"I could not understand why a baby's toy would be so expensive,  but caved into the hype and bought it for my daughter. She loved it and we took it with us everywhere.It is soft, durable plastic and has no stinky,  plastic odor.",5
"HALO Sleepsack 100% Cotton Wearable Blanket, Blue Jungle Print, Small",I love the HALO sleepsacks!  This is the fourth one I have bought. I had 2 smalls and 3 mediums as my baby grew. They are great because they give her the extra warmth of a blanket but she can't get caught up in it and suffocate. I am just getting ready to purchase the larger size for her as she is getting just about to big for the mediums. I will continue to use the HALO sacks until she is at least 1 if not longer.  It has been integrated into her nap and bedtimes so she knows that it about time to sleep when she gets zipped into her sleepsack.  Definitely recommend them for all babies!,5
"Bambino Mio Nappy Bucket and Lid, White","I was very pleased with this product. I read the reviews carefully, and eyed the dimensions.Personally I sometimes feel a limited connection with some moms, because most have their own home and more space for things. I live in a small apartment, where space is precious. It's what I would call cozy, but potentially messy if not kept organized. So you can imagine my anxiety about going the cloth diaper route!This pail helped alleviate a lot of that anxiety. I love the handle so I can easily carry it from spot to spot, even out to the coin operated laundry and not feel awkward. It IS in the smaller range of things, so be sure you pull out a ruler and understand the dimensions.. however, I never understood the big, bulky trash cans passed off as diaper cans anyway, and my logic was, the bigger the can, the more likely I would be to allow cloth diapers to pile up for an unecessary amount of time and then have to fish them out. This perfect little pail doesn't draw unecessary attention to itself either, and I don't feel like I have to devote a large amount of space to it. It can fit right in my bathroom, next to the toilet if I chose.Would most definitely recommed to a cloth diapering mom who intends to do her loads fairly regularly (probably not as accomodating for moms who are going to wait every few days though or may not have a lot of time). As I said, read the dimensions and decide how often you intend to use cloth diapers and how many. I myself will be using the starting recommended of 24, and will be using disposables occasionally when out, plus since I am a stay at home mother, I will have a little more leeway with getting laundry done than some.Hope this helps. :)",5
HABA Kringelring Rattle Clutching Toy,"My daughter loved this teether since she was 4 months old.  It was the first toy she was able to transfer from one hand to the next -- a big milestone as any mom will tell you!  It was a favorite for a long time.  She's a year old now, and the Haba Ring is still in great shape after much abuse (7 teeth by 9 months!).  Would highly recommend this...  I include it in all my shower gifts.",5
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,"Cleans easily, travels easily. It was a great transition from high-chair to big table. My son calls it his big-boy chair.",5
Mommy's Helper Slide-Lok Bi-Fold Door Lock,I was a little skeptical about ordering these but they work great! No pinched fingers and clothes stay on their hangers! I would recommend these to everyone.,5
Fisher-Price Rainforest Jumperoo,"Seriously, when you ask your baby if she wants to play in the jumparoo, and she laughs and makes happy excited sounds, you will know you did right to buy this thing. The set up was pretty simple, and we had it assembled in a few minutes. It is a stable jumparoo rather than a rolling one, which i think is a nice feature personally. The seat seems pretty comfortable. We noticed that our daughter seems to lean forward in it a bit, but i think that is really more because she wants to look more closely at the various playthings that surround her rather than any crafting imbalance. The seat does rotate, which really brings this thing to life once your baby figures it out. Two of the three knobs on the top of this have little dolls suspended from them (a toucan and some sort of spotted frog). The other stuff is separated in thirds...the primary third has a little monkey, an elephant, and a bird. This section also has the audio controls...pretty much any direct contact will set off a bunch of animal sounds, and of course, messing with each individual animal releases its song, which is encapsulated within a little ditty that accompanies the animal noises. Let me tell you....it can be annoying, but you can easily tune it out. Our daughter though just adores it. She jumps up and down, swats and spins the animals, and just laughs and laughs at the noises and music that comes from it. The second section is a larger spinner with a crocodile inside, and the last third is an even larger spinner with a smiling sun. Our daughter like them as well, although it seems like she appreciates them as little diversions before getting back to the main play section.So, all in all, judging from our daughter's reaction to this jumparoo, i would say definitely get one. You will be well rewarded with a happy feeling as you watch your baby have oodles and oodles of fun. I think it also helps with a baby's development of leg and back strength as well as their hand eye coordination from what i have observed.One note though...this is no substitute for your presence...although fun. our daughter will generally want out after a half hour or so. You can only swat a little elephant so many times in one stretch it seems, lol. So, great for when your baby is bored, and possibly you need to get the laundry folded or something, but it isnt a babysitter.Anyway,Enjoy!",5
CoCaLo Sugar Plum Waste Basket,"The product looks like the picture, I read a review that stated this basket was heavy but I do not believe this basket is heavy at all.  It is light, pretty and goes with the rest of the decor for my daughter's room.",5
"Joovy Caboose Stand On Tandem Stroller, Black","I have waited a little over 6 months since I purchased this stroller to write a review.All in all it is a great stroller, the metal tubing which makes up the body is rectangular rather than round making it VERY much more sturdy than one of a different design.My main complaint with the stroller is the fact that you have to strap a baby car seat in, it doesn't snap in. It works that way for the first year you have a baby in it, but I would rather it snap in instead of having to mess with straps and buckles.As a man of roughly 6ft tall, I hate strollers as a general rule, they are far too short and I end up hurting my back when pushing them because Im hunched over the whole time. This one isn't like that and that is the big bonus for me, its 3 to 4 inches taller than a standard handle so I can stand upright when pushing.Its rather large and cumbersome but not overly so. The back seat slides freely so the kid in the back can sit or stand depending on their liking. I haven't decided if I like that or not.All in all it is still one of the best strollers I have found despite my issues with it, Ill be using it for years to come.",4
Kleenex Splash'N Go Hand and Face Wash Wipes 35 Count (Pack of 8) 280 Total,"These are great for keeping in my desk at work, in bag while traveling, and in my car. I use them after pumping gas or in the middle of the day to wipe my face.The packaging is nice on these compared to other similar products. The moisture is maintained for a long time after opening the package, and it's very easy to open and close.",5

Ring Snuggies ~ Ring Sizer / Assorted Sizes Adjuster Set of Six Per Pack,"These seemed like they would be the perfect solution for a ring I have that's too large, but they are so uncomfortable! I tried it for a day, but it scratch the finger that I wore it on as well as any other skin that it happened to com in contact with.  It's also really bulky under your ring, so you can constantly feel it. It's also too small to fit around a wedding band set, so you would have to wear 2 which would make it extra bulky. Not a great solution...",1
"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","I recieved the Bjorn as a gift and it is one of the most benifical product in my collection of baby essentials.  This is my first child and didn't realize how difficult simple tasks, ex: making a sandwhich, would become.  This not only frees up my hands, but is a life saver when he wants to nurse, and dinner is on the table.Another benifit is my son is less fussy because he is comfortable laying against me.  He's still is getting used to his stroller, which means he's still scared of it.  The bjorn makes going out in public possible.",5
Playtex Drop-Ins NaturaLatch Silicone Nipple - Fast Flow - 2 Pack,good and perfect .i love it this is my second time i used it's easy for the mother i recommended .,5
"Comotomo Baby Bottle, Green/Pink, 5 Ounce, 2-Count",My daughter is having to pump and then feed with a bottle and was having difficulty with the Brown's bottle and one other kind and after I ordered these bottles life which much less stressful. I would recommend them to anyone.,5
"Summer Infant Secure Surround Play Safe Play Yard, Tan","I use this mostly to block areas, such as the entry to the front porch. This keeps the kids as well as the dog from leaving the porch or any other areas. Comes assembled and ready to use out of the box.",5
BabyPlus Prenatal Education System,"I have to say that I was skeptical when I purchased this product but now I'm so glad I did. My daughter was born in October of 2008, and she was indeed very alert and till this day a great sleeper. But the most beneficial aspect I believe is that she is developmentally advance. She started talking at 7 months by the time she was one she was speaking in full sentences. She has an incredible memory before we go to the grocery store I just tell her what we need to get and she will remember everything I said. She loves for me to read books to her and she has about 50 books that she can read from memory. She loves music and playing musical instruments. She can also create instruments out of almost anything. I can go on for days about my daughter but as a preschool teacher I can say that my two year knows and can do about 90% of what the 3-5 year olds that I teach can do. I cant say for certain that had I not purchased the baby plus my daughter would have been as smart but I believe that it works and I will definitely use it again.",5
"RECARO ProRIDE Convertible Car Seat, Misty",Love the seat cuz it has lots of cushion and Padding. East to use and assemble. Bulky in car thought. Love the color too,5
"Munchkin Wood and Steel Designer Gate, Dark Wood/Silver","I would purchase this product again and I recommend it to others. My only reservation is that it is not as applicable to doorways with very wide openings. When fully extended, as mine needed to be, it loses some of its stability. Otherwise, it is very attractive and easy to assemble.",4
"Arm's Reach Ideal Arc Original Co-Sleeper Bedside Bassinet, Natural","Ok, I admit, that setting it up could have been easier.  It took two of us. However, now that it's in use, I cannot imagine my life without it.  I love the fact that it fits so securely to our bed, nothing can get between it and our mattress unless I purposely shove something (like the sheets) in between there.  I can easily pick up our baby and soothe her or nurse her.  It's also incredibly easy to calm her by reaching my hand over and stroking her little head.  I can also sit up in bed, slip a &#34;chuck&#34; between her and the crib sheet, and change her diaper.  Believe me, when the pains of having just delivered a baby are still screaming between your legs, having the ability to attend to your baby without getting up constantly - is essential!  The co-sleeper looks nice, doesn't need the additional waterproof mattress liner (mattress already is waterproof enough), but it's important to buy extra sheets (not standard crib sheets either). A talented seamstress could sew additional sheets, but they require quite a bit of detail on the underside (velcro, loops, button holes...) to attach to the co-sleeper properly. One sheet does come with the co-sleeper purchase.Noteworthy: having a high bed isn't a problem with the extension pieces.",5
BRICA Seat Guardian Car Seat Protector,"Fits our 2014 Ford Explorer perfectly. Easy access to the LATCH clips in the seat, recommend.",5
Summer Infant Baby Touch Digital Color Video Monitor,"I was one of those moms who originally said, ""I do not need this thing.  What's wrong with the good, old-fashioned monitor?  Her room is only 10 feet away!"". I did not understand how obsessed I would be with the camera monitor until I started to sleep train my LO at 5 mo.  It is nice to see how she is doing while she is getting herself to sleep and calming down.  I can see if her eyes are open and I can see her chest is moving up and down (I know...new mom, SIDS paranoid).  And, all the while, I do not risk waking her by opening her door.  You will not regret this purchase!  And amazon has the best price!Pros -- camera is good quality (night vision is wonderful)- sound is great- love the features of the monitor (zoom, scan, option to add more cameras, sound level indicator)- wall mount optionCons (if you want to even call them that) -- Finding the perfect place to put the monitor in the room is a challenge (to see her from all angles, positions in the crib), but I think we will wall mount it to resolve.- extra base for camera uses disposable batteries (10 hours of use). I wish that they were rechargeable.  10 hours is not even one night.- ""talk back"" feature is unnecessary now, but we may use it as she gets older.  TBD.If Summer were to put a thermostat feature on this monitor, I think I would die and go to heaven!  :)",5
The Heavenly Stroller,"My husband and I are both over 6 feet tall and this is the prefect umbrella stroller for us. We hate umbrella strollers because we end up walking hunched over, but this stroller brings the handles up to our height.We bought this stroller for our first child over 3 years ago and we are currently on our 3rd child - who is now ridding in this stroller. It has held up really well.2 small complaints: 1) the handle is hard to raise and lower. The buttons are stiff. But, we just set it and never moved it again. 2) There is a break on the front wheels that always seem to fall and lock the wheels. It's annoying. I just pulled them off. I'm just using this on city sidewalks and in the mall - I don't really need the front breaks anyway.1 bonus: Because of the shape of the arms when they are raised it causes a place for you to hang bags right on the stroller. We use this extra bar space all the time.",5

Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium Cradle Swing,"This was great.  It was not only cute- but it made my son happy. It was often the only way he would take long naps.

My husband wished there was one for him as well.We were very happy with this swing.",5

"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue","Babies are used to being 'swaddled' in the womb so why wouldn't they want to be when they are born? And, you just can't swaddle the baby like the nurses do at the hospital with just a little blanket. This takes the brains out of everything with easy to place velcro. One thing I recommend is to by them new. I bought a few off of ebay used and the velcro needs to be sticky. They lose their stickiness over time. They are awesome!!!",5

Lamaze Play &amp; Grow Freddie the Firefly Take Along Toy,"Warning! Do not purchase this toy. My child has gotten her ankle and arm stuck in the rings of this toy.

"American Baby Company Organic Cotton Interlock Crib Sheet, Natural","I love, love, love this sheet!  It is soft, fits on the mattress well, and organic; total package! It feels more like a cross between a flannel and knit sheet rather than a traditional cotton sheet.  I have been using it for about 4 months now, and have not had any problems with it shrinking as other reviewers have.  Overall, I would highly recommend it.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White","Got it as expected. My doorway opening is almost 40 inches and it fits exactly what it says. Only problem I faced is, the type of material, metal. My LO has just fell on the gate and got hurt in her head :(, luckily nothing happened, but we have to be very careful in future so as she won't get hurt. Why can't the gate be in Plastic? As it is is mainly used for babies, it should be made from soft material. But apart from that, it serves well what it is supposed to be.",4
"Graco Glider Petite LX Gliding Swing, Forecaster","As a mother of four, let me tell you, we have had many swings in our house!  My children are all older now, but this is awesome for traveling!  Move it room to room or take it to grandma's house!  I love that it is low to the ground as well!  Some reviewers complained about the ""noise""? I didn't find it noisy at all.  Babies adjust to noise and compared to three siblings running around the house, this was nothing!  :-) Seriously, I am giving it a five star review because it is portable, suits a boy or girl, does everything the product says it will do! You can't beat that!",5

"GroVia Organic Stay Dry Booster 2 Pack, White",I purchased these to try and make my stay dry pads last over night. They don't add much of a boost to the pad. They are durable but suck for their actual use. I ended up buying some hemp boosters and they work much better with the grovia liners. This is the only product of grovias that I don't absolutely love.,2

"Munchkin Star Fountain, Colors May Vary","Everything everyone else has posted is true.  Would have been super sweet if it had lasted.... our boy loved it!!!

"Diono RadianRXT Convertible Car Seat, Plum","I drive a G37 coupe (think sports car) and having the infant carrier in that car was pretty much a nightmare. We have an evenflo in our other car, and I knew it would not fit in my car, no way, no how. I asked around to all of my friends who had kids a little older than mine and one suggested this car seat. (Which used to be called Sunshine Kids) She happens to have a Britax and this one, and said ""Hands down this one is better. I wish I had 2""Here's what I like:1. You can fold it pretty much flat for air traveling (I suggest getting the extra bag accessory, but it's not necessary)2. The sides are not bulky so your child can see around and not get frustrated that he/she can't see out of the window or look at the passenger next to them.3. Fits BEAUTIFULY in a small car! It has a low profile seat (the butt is only about 3"" off of the actual seat of the car) less bumped heads, and my son can climb in and out by himself at 1.5 yr old. (And for a tall SUV - we have a Tahoe- it would be much easier to get the kid in and out, especially if you are shorter like me at 5'5). Our evenfow has a bulky bottom and sits about 6-8"" above the seat, making it sometimes difficult to get our son in there especially when he is fighting it.4. All of the connectors the chest strap connector & the seat belt insert are very easy to work, feel high quality and the tighten and release is so easy to work. (I have heard mothers complain about this, and I know because our Evenflow, is a pain to tighten as much as needed)5. It will grow with my child, I can already tell it will last him at least several years, it's rated to 120 lbs, not sure that would work but does look like he has room to grow a lot.6. I find it easy to install in my G37, but it's a newer model car, the anchors are easy to work.7. You can add up to 4 cup holders.8. (This one could be a pro or con depending on the person but I think it's a plus) The seat is made of mostly steel. It's a heavy 24 lbs. I like this because it feels safe and secure, and I don't feel like it flexes like the plastic car seats. Plus I live in Texas It get's hot here, for some reason I just have a gut feeling that steel holds up better in the heat than plastic.Cons:1. It can be heavy to carry in an airport, but I just look at that as more calories burned. AND it folds up, unlike a britax or other brands and has a shoulder strap, so is still seems superior over the other options.We are planning to give the Evenflo to the grandparents since they would not have to use it every single day, and replace the seat in our other car with this one.I have mine installed Front facing although I know there is an option for rear facing, I have not tried it.Parting words, Yes, it's a little more expensive but it's definitely WORTH THE MONEY!!!!",5
BabyPlus Prenatal Education System,But I had a very active baby and it literally made him move so much it made me sick. I eventually stopped using it because the movement became so erratic it seemed like it was scaring him.,2
"Mam Nipples Slow Flow, 0+ months, 2 pack",I have used MAM bottles for two babies so far... each of them had issues with spitting up while we were in the hospital (when they give you those bottles with the formula in them already) ... when we got home I switched my kids to the mam bottles and instantly they were much much better with spit up issues.  recommend them to all my friends!,5

"OXO Perfect Pull Wipes Dispenser, Pink","The concept is great, however the product comes with NO instructions, not even a diagram.So I was not sure if I should leave the wipes in the plasic refill package or take them out of the bag.If you do take them out of the package and put them in the dispenser, the wipes will start to dry out rather quickly.It could be a workable item, but you would need to find refill packages that actually fit inside it and then fiddle with the opening in the refill package to properly dispense.Overall, it looks nice, but just using the wipes straight out of the refill packages is more cost effective and gives a better seal to keep the wipes moistYes it worked with all types of wipes, the one I had seemed to have either a defective latch or a defective gaskget since our wipes kept drying out, I would suggest leaving the wipes in the plastic refill package if you buy the 80 count sized refill wipes, and just set the refill package inside the dispenser.Warning, even a short drop, like if a toddler picks it up and drops it, can break the latch mechanism",3
Graco Backless TurboBooster Car Seat in Chatter,"Due to differing laws regarding child seats in different states, we happen to be legal without them here in NH. However, our parents live in IL, where seats are going to be required for several more years. On a recent trip to IL in which we flew to Chicago, we realized that it was actually cheaper to buy new seats for my twins and ship them to my mother-in-law's house than it was to pay the ridiculous airline baggage fees each way. This way, too, we could leave the seats there for the next few years and not worry about it.This is a great basic seat, perfect for what it is. The seats we do still tend to use here at home, even though they aren't required, are also Graco. They are a little nicer, having a tempurpedic type seat stuffing material that is more comfortable, but they are the convertible bottom portion of the full backed booster style that was significantly more expensive.For a secondary seat, these are perfect. They were very economical and work great. The basic pattern is better for my nearly 7 year olds than the character patterns which they are already pretty much beyond.I believe that the covers are washable, but of course as these are sitting in IL and were only used for 4 days, I can't comment on that part of it.My children always enjoy having their own cupholders, too. These in the seat are easier to reach than the ones in our van, for sure, and my mother-in-law's car doesn't have them in the back seat.I really recommend this as a replacement or secondary booster.",4
Evenflo X Sport Convenience Stroller - Grey,"This stroller has so many great features. We only have a car, so sometimes it's tough to fit our regular stroller in the trunk with all the other things we have to take with us.  This is awesome because it's so compact, yet it still has a basket, cup holders, a carrying pouch and a shade. It doesn't lay down or anything, so you do want your child to be holding him/herself up well before using this stroller (probably 6 months or so). My only complaint is that it's a little shorter than I'd hoped.  I do sort of wish I'd held off and paid the extra $10-15 for the Convenience Plus with adjustable height handles.  I'm 5'9"", and it's not terrible but would be more comfortable to push if the handles were a couple inches higher.  All in all, I would say this is an excellent value!",4
"Dreambaby Extra Wide Car Window Shade, Black, 2 Pack",This works with our Denali and with our jeep.  It stays in place and blocks the sun well.  I would like two more.,5
Bright Starts Kashmir Ingenuity Smart and Quiet Swing,"I bought this for my fourth child. I have owned everything from the Zen swing to the self propelled and nothing compares with this model.  Easily put together, in minutes, the fabric seemed a bit thin when I first touched it but I found it allowed my child to not overheat in the swing when all bundled up, so what at first seemed a tad 'cheap' turned out to be very good.  I have had this product for 9 months now and have NO complaints... nothing has broken or malfunctioned, it is still in perfect working order and it still has the first set of batteries I put in it!! SHOCKER! I love it !! Folding it is easy which I did often , easy to clean and transport, son loved it.. wish this was around for the other 3!! those big huge clunkly swings although 'sturdy' took up way too much room and were hell to take anywhere.. this was a breeze!",5

We have the 20&#34; Eebee doll, the bathtime (tub toy) Eebee, all the Eebee DVDs, the Eebee iphone/ipad app, & the last thing we needed was this Shape-Fits Eebee. We were so excited to snag the last one this March. We've been looking for quite a while.All of the Eebee products are VERY, VERY well made. & insanely adorable. This toy is amazing. It's very easy to see why it won all the awards it has (:I definitely recommend it to any mommy or daddy with a baby or toddler.",5
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 3 Pack Graduates Kiddy Cutlery Set, Colors May Vary","Bought this for our 22 month old granddaughter and she is learning to use the fork, the knife will come much later.

"Baby Girl Pink Initial Sip N' Munch, Letter G","the cup is cute but its not for small baby hands and wasnt designed with the same sturdiness as other baby cups.  the whole thing comes apart when dropped.cute but only past a certain age.  in all honesty, i think it'd be better marketed to bigger kids--maybe like elementary school age--and not even toddlers.  buying this for a baby is not a good idea.  my daughter is 13 months old, by the way.",3
"Summer Infant Multi-Use Deco Extra Tall Walk-Thru Gate, Bronze","These gates (I bought 3) are the best I've ever used.  They are very simple to install, function well, although they don't always lock behind me, and they look great.  The style fits perfectly in our home and we've gotten many compliments on them.  Now we feel we have the function  and security we need without making our house look like daycare!  Love them!",5

Leachco Snoogle Total Body Pillow,I didnt think i would really need one of these pilklows considering that my belly was so small at 5 months. But I got tired of the sleepless nights due to lack of support. Since making this purchase I am able to sleep more comfortably (especially since the belly has grown a bit). the only drawback is that every time I want to roll over i have to wake up and adjust the pillow.,5
Maclaren Triumph Stroller - Color: Scarlet,"It is lightweight, easy to carry and seems very quality, additionally you can drive it with single hand.",5
The First Years Hands Free Gate,We got these gates when our son started walking at 9 months. Our house has a floor plan where you can walk in basically a circle through all the downstairs rooms. We needed to keep him in the living room so we bought 2 gates to take care of 2 doorways. It is a pressure mounted gate and very easy to install. I put up both gates in less than half an hour.They are very sturdy and will adjust to the width of the doorways. We did not know that our doorways were different sizes until we put these in. Our son can't budge the gates even though he trieds and the step to open it is great. I am way too short for any of the gates you have to step over.These are pretty portable too. We take they too my mom's when our son stay there on weekends. I would buy these again in a second. I believe they will last past our next child too.,5
"Slingezee Baby Sling Black, Regular","My infant looved the moby but I wasn't able to continue breastfeeding her and walking around with her comfortably after her 3rd month.  So, I bought an upright carrier (Beco Gemini) which works great but still doesn't cover/hold the baby the way the Moby did.She was really sick last night and the upright carrier just won't do for soothing her at 3am.  The Moby has been in the basement since every time I've tried it the baby just can't seem to get comfortable anymore and it's really not conducive to a quiet 3am soothing since I have to take my time to wrap it and inert her.My baby is still sick with the flu that's been going around this season and just can't seem to be consoled.  I sent my husband to the local store to buy a Maya wrap but it was sold out.  They had a single Slingeeze left.  I told him to bring it home b/c it's worth trying for the baby's comfort.Oh my goodness was that the right call!  It was hand in glove.  I slipped her right in, adjusted the top 'rail' and breastfed her then and there.  After which, she fell asleep  right away for 2 1/2 hours! Wow!! She hasn't fallen asleep in a carrier since the I last used the Moby 7 months ago.This is great and I'm so glad that we decided to try it out.The railing is a perfect 'pillow' for her head.  I tried my friend's sling wrap and I couldn't quite get it right but I was desperate (no sleep last night) and wanted to buy one anyway.  Thankfully, the Slingezee was available and is  just about foolproof (for me) in terms of finagling with excess cloth b/c it's just a pull on the 'tail(?)'.  Either way, it's made all set up and ready to go!May it be as good for you too!",5
Disney Pooh Musical Mobile Delightful Day,i loved this product its awesoe... the butterflys dont open like the picture shows but im working on them its still amazing! and matches the crib bedding perfect!,5
"Westwood Design Meadowdale Crib,Chestnut Brown","We purchased this crib 4 years ago from a Burlington coat factory. My husband and I decided to purchase this crib because it was much sturdier than anything else at the store, the design is beautiful, and it was given good reviews in the baby bargains book. It was also priced well for a convertible at less than $500.When we got it home we were pleasently suprised at how easy it was to put together and have contiued to love it when having to adjust the mattress depth at how simple it is. We have been using it now as a toddler bed for about 1.5 years with a universal wooden rail purchased from Babies r'us. Also the finish on this crib is great. Even after moving to a new home it has no knicks or scratches on it. I do have a Cocoon 1000 series crib for our other daugter and have been disappointed in the ability of the stain to withstand scratching. The Cocoon crib has also been more difficult to adjust the height settings without dismantling the whole crib.Be aware though when you go to purchase the convertible rails that they will take about 4 months to get. We purchased ours shortly after the birth of our daughter for fear that they would discontinue the product and we would not be able to get them at all. YOU WILL NEED TO PLAN AHEAD.We have not yet attached the adult conversion rails to the bed yet so I cannot make comments to the height.This is the only crib made in the Hart brand which is actually created by Westwood company. I would most certainly purchase another crib or furniture from the Westwood company and wish that we would have purchased one for our second child instead of a Cocoon crib. We did look extensively but at that time did not care for any of their other designs. Many of the company's other designs are very modern and not as detailed as the Meadowdale. Hopefully they will have more cribs in the future.",5
"JJ Cole Car Seat Cover, Khaki","Our little bundle of joy was only a couple months old when the cold weather started hitting and I needed something to help keep her warm. This works SO much better than blankets and couldn't be easier!! I stretched it over our Graco carseat in about 30 seconds and was ready to go. I've never had a problem with the zipper... has never snagged or been loud. The baby used to wake up very easily but as long as I did it slowly I could unzip it without stirring her at all. When she was little I could put the flap over her while going in and out which was really nice. Once she got to be about 4-5 months old though she would just push it off. Even so, it's still great because it provides warmth to the rest of her body and I can just drap a blanket over top when going in and out of places. I will say it does keep her nice and toasty so it definitely does it's job but this is also why I would unzip it when we got home so she wouldn't get too warm. I thought it was a great price, it's super easy to use, and keeps the baby warm which is what really matters! I think that by about 9 months this will start to get too small to zip all the way for most babies but I don't think they usually need it as much :)",5
Kushies 5 Pack Reusable Ultra Diapers for Infants,"These diapers are a lot of trouble when it comes laundry time. They have to be fastened inside out in order to really get them clean, it takes forever to get them dry at least an hour maybe more, and when they are dry you have to work them back into shape before using them again.  They are the least expensive AIO diaper, but I would definitely recommend paying more for a better diaper.",2
Lamaze Tug &amp; Play Activity Knot Take Along Toy,"I own the: moose, captain calamari, cube, giraffe, fish, porcupine. My firstborn was obsessed with the Lamaze toys. My secondborn child liked some parts of the Lamaze toys, but wasn't as capitated as the firstborn.So, I bought this Knot toy. The secondborn really likes it. Each item is easy for him to grasp, mouth, or teethe on. The teething and grasping ability  of the toy for an infant is really important to me because I'm slowly realizing that if my baby can't hold it, then he can't teethe on it or play with it (duh). This toy allows him to grab easily and bring it to his mouth.I highly recommend the Knot, Moose, Cpt Calamari.",5
"Born Free 5 oz. BPA-Free High-Heat Resistant Classic Bottle with ActiveFlow Venting Technology, 3-Pack","My first baby wouldn't take any bottle, ever.  It was breast feeding only or nothing.  So I wanted to try these with my second child (newborn) and am thrilled to report that he took the Born Free bottle.The bottle is easy to put together, with the active flow piece inserted into the bottle the cap and nipple are twisted on.  There was no leaking and I didn't notice any air getting into his mouth while he ate.I liked that the bottle was lightweight plastic that is BPA free.  I steamed them clean and as happy with the result.The package came with three bottles in it, which is perfect for me - I don't need any more than that.  They have bottle covers for traveling with the bottles, but I haven't used them yet.",5
Imse Vimse Water Shoes,"We have gotten a lot of miles out of these water shoes. I purchased size 12-18 months when my daughter was 14 months old and they were slightly big for her, but functional. She wore them for beach vacations during the winter and now almost every day during the summer. We keep them in our stroller and use them at playgrounds with water features and at pools and beaches. She can run in the the water and play on the equipment easily with these water shoes on. I plan to order the next size up for her.",5
"Edushape 4&quot; Sensory Balls, Set of 4, Solid","Besides the fact that the sensory balls arrived about 1/4 full of air (and that's being generous...3 out of four looked like someone spit inside them while manually blowing them up! The outside wasn't dirty, just the inside had a disgusting film on them. Waste of money, waste of time to return...ended up buying what I needed at BuyBuy Baby the next day for a better price. Don't buy from this vendor, they clearly don't care about product quality...any idiot would have noticed the beyond damaged merchandise when it was shipped. Normally I would file a complaint and go through the process to ship back and return...but being 37 weeks pregnant I don't have the time or energy to deal with it and chalk it up to getting screwed over and being disgusted. Least I could do is warn other parents...don't waste your time and money, buy somewhere else.",1

Nosefrida Baby Nasal Aspirator with 4 filters and 20 Additional Filters,"My 7 week old son is a regurgitator and throws up if he's put flat on his back too soon after eating and/or without a very good burp. That said, he is congested quite frequently. Both of us hate the aspirator bulb as I can't tell if it's working so I just keep at it. Maybe it's a gross mom thing, but I LOVE being able to SEE what's coming out of his nose so I know whether or not &#34;I got it&#34; lol...I think this is by far the best little known baby product I've purchased. I use it at least once a day and when I use it with saline drops, I'm able to clean his nose in under 30 seconds...with the aspirator bulb it takes me that long to keep him from moving his head. He cries, but stops immediately when his nose is clear! It's a must-have for any nursery. I'm getting a 2nd for my diaper bag!!!",5
"Summer Infant Swaddleme MicroFleece Adjustable Infant Wrap, Blue, Small/Medium","My son loves SwaddleMe products! He's a little more than a month old and he's been using them for 3-4 weeks now. I bought this for him because it was going to be cooler where we live. It's not too heavy but keeps him nice and warm. SwaddleMe is soft and cozy. All of the SwaddleMe Products help him sleep easier and I will admit that they've 100% helped me and my husband sleep at night. Once he's in his ""baby straight jacket"" he sleeps at least 4 hours a night, sometimes up to 6! So easy to use too! There is a video a person made on youtube if you have no idea how to put it on baby. Great investment!",5
Dragonfly Mobile Decoration for Baby Nursery Ceiling Wall Room Decorations Outdoor Home Decorations,"I ordered this mobile to hang over my daughter's changing table. When it arrived, the dragonflies were much bigger than I thought they were. (I didn't really review the product details before ordering. I just went by the pictures but realize now that none of them really had other objects next to the mobile to give it some scale.)But I hung it anyway and now really love it. I was worried that being so big it would draw too much focus to that part of the room but they're so light and airy they add a nice touch without dominating the changing station. And my daughter loves staring up at them.Glad I got them and glad they were bigger than I expected.",5
"Tadpoles 0-6 Months Embroidered Sleep Sack, Monkey ABCs","I love this sleep sack it is soooooo soft and cuddly and the embroidery is an extra special touch. However, I'm worried to put and infant in this as the head opening could fit a whole entire baby through it. Same goes for the arm holes~it's just really really big more so for an older child I would think. Picture doesn't show it but the zipper actually starts up by the right armpit hole and zips all the way down and around making for easy quick diaper changes.",4
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,I think most of the people overrated Sophie. My son shows no interest in this teetering at all. He actually likes to grab it and bang it. And the price is wayyyyyyyy too expensive. i wont recommend it.,3
Cloud b Sleep Sheep On The Go Travel Sound Machine with Four Soothing Sounds,"We are HUGE fans of the Sleep Sheep and recommend it and buy it as a baby gift often.  We like the selection of sounds and the ability to control the volume and select from two different run-times.  The velcro strap and size make it handy to take with you on car trips or to use when away from home.  When we wanted to wean our kids off of white noise, we lowered the volume each day a little more until they just didn't need it anymore.  But, we've had quality issues with all three that we've had.  Bought the first one on amazon for the first baby.  It worked well with daily use for a year then just crapped out.  I probably wouldn't have considered that a problem b/c it did get A LOT of use and we easily got our money's worth.  It wasn't used as a toy and although we did travel with it, it didn't really get beat up.  Bought a second one from Toys R Us for the second baby a few years later and that one stopped working at 10 minutes every time, no matter what length of time it was set for.  Returned it to the store and the replacement always stops at 20 minutes even when set for the longer time.  Kept it anyway b/c it's just hard to keep getting back to a store with a newborn and we needed it and it worked well enough to make do.I definitely still recommend this if your baby is a white noise kind of kiddo, but make sure you check the return policy from the vendor just in case.",4

"Thermos Foogo Leak-Proof Stainless Steel 10-Ounce Food Jar, Pink","I purchased this product based on an article I saw in a Parenting magazine saying it was the only thermal jar to pass some test for keeping food warm at a safe temperature for 5 hrs.  BULL!  After 2 hrs, you can expect food that was piping hot when placed in the thermos to be lukewarm, at best.  It's nice to have in terms of storage (doesn't leak), but it surely doesn't keep food all that warm.  At least not mac n cheese.  Maybe soup will stay warmer.  Haven't tried that yet.  I give it a 3.",3
"Boon Animal Bag Stuffed Animal Storage, Blue Raspberry","My boys have had this storage pod for years now and love it.

"Nurtria Regular Neck Bottles with Organizer, Blue, 6-Count","Why is it so hard to find a Bottle Caddy? This one is so cute! My 8-month old nephew loves his Medela bottles, so I really only needed the caddy. It's a little tight but it does the trick. I can pack all of his bottles for daycare/babysitter/long trip. It's so compact and fits neatly in the fridge or a cooler. Highly recommended!",5
Disney Cars Bath Tub Mat,"I wanted a fun bath tub mat for my daughter so I got her this. I love the look of it and it does its job. I only have two minor complaints. First, it is not as big as I was expecting it to be. It is a little short for our standard size tub and not quite wide enough either. It's not a huge deal b/c she is supervised but still cause for concern. My other issue with this is that you have to pull it up after every bath/shower b/c water does get underneath it and if you don't let it air out, it can get mildewy etc. Probably best for an older child who doesn't need quite so much supervision and a patient parent who doesn't mind putting it down before every use. And pulling it back up.",3

Kidkusion Toddler Edge Kushions Black,"The foam was in brand new condition but the tape that is ""suppose to"" fasten it to any surface is a waste of money. After having it on our coffee table (which is glass) for only a week, the tape lost it's tackiness and the foam started falling off. I had to secure the foam to the table with packaging tape, which now looks even worse than the foam alone. When shopping for this product, please choose a different brand.",2

"Fisher-Price Booster Seat, Rainforest","I bought this for when we visit the grandparents or friends' homes. It works great, keeps him entertained for a short while and works as a makeshift high chair. I originally thought I would use this in restaurants as well, but it's a little bulky to tote around with everything else like diaper bag, etc. even when you fold it up. I'd rather just stick a cover on the restaurant high chair and call it a day.",5
NTM-910YIC - Sony Baby Call Nursery Monitor,"We have two other monitors but we left them behind when we were visiting New York. So, we thought this was sort of mid range in price and it's Sony so it's probably good. We were wrong. It works but only a few feet outside the door of our kids room. Every time you pass the monitor it makes a loud static noise. We've tried to change the frequency but it didn't help. It's not attractive either. We're surprised Sony makes it. Spend 10 to 20 bucks more on something better.",2

Sesame Street Adjustable Juice Box Holder,"I just received this SS juice box holder a few weeks ago and already wonder what I ever did without it.  Wait, I remember, I changed a lot of juice soaked/stained shirts.  The inner compartment lifts out for easy placement of your juice box or bag - it accommodates either.  I've tried both short and tall juice boxes and they all work fine, the inner compartment raises and lowers to fit all boxes that I've used with no squishing.  The back of the holder has a place for you to put your child's name (i.e. This box belongs to) and it's dishwasher safe; a must in my busy house.  The housing is strong and solid, and the handles make it so easy for my 24 month old to carry around, drink out of, etc.  It is a little on the bulky side, but well worth the space that it takes up in my diaper bag.  I'll be ordering more for gifts soon!",5
"phil&amp;teds Lobster Highchair, Red","We originally purchased the Inglesina Fast Chair but I was frustrated with the fact that it had no tray and there was a gap between the chair and table. After having multiple gel mats flung to the floor and food shoved into the gap and onto the floor I purchased the lobster chair. I have used it for three days (we use it in lieu of a stand alone high chair) and am satisfied with how easily it attached and the tray. No more dents in my table from slammed bottles and no more flying mats. Hooray! Several people complained how easily the tray slides out. I have not found this to be a problem. In the future if little one decides shoving it forward is fun I will slip a piece of non-slip matting under the tray. The bucket seat is a little deep in order to accompany kids of all sizes. My little one is on the small size so I folded a towel and put it in the seat to boost him up a bit. Eventually I will not need the towel. Over all I am satisfied with this chair. It packs up compactly, is easier and less bulky than the Inglesina, has a tray and sits little one closer to the table. Win, win.",5
Biddy Belly,"I brought the Biddy Buddy for my three month old and it worked. My infant went from not crying everytime we did tummy to rolling over herself and staying on her stomach with a smile. If anything i would say upgrade the little dangling toy objects, they are cheaply made but its also a plus bc i just replace the cheap side toys with my own toy selection. All and all a great developmental toy for my bundle of joy.",4
Philips AVENT Basic Baby Monitor with DECT Technology,"We previously used a video monitor system that claimed to have ""no interference"" however, living in a heavily populated area with tons of electronic devices you can say we had some issues; Snaps, crackles and pops every night and nonstop at that. This could not last as out sleep was suffering.Doing a little research we happened upon this item. The DACT filtering really works and works well. All you get is the noise of your wee one. In fact, with the sensitivity settings, you can even set it so you only get it when the little one is at a sound level you want to hear! These means I don't have to hear the general non stop chatter that ours does just before he completely crashes. Instead I have ours set so that I'll hear him just before he gets worked up. What this means is more sleep for me! And, in fact, more sleep for him as I'm not trying to wake him up prematurely.The other great benefit is that the device acts as a two way radio. This is great as if my spouse is feeding the little master, we can still converse from the other room (and vice versa on that). This is amazingly handy - and a great feature. It is advertised as a way to sooth your child and while I'm not sure about that (that's not really my style) I can say its a great way to talk without yelling to one another.Overall setup was a breeze. Thankfully these are both plug and battery operated. The general quality feels like a good piece of plastic. It should easily last a few years. And it can take a fall.Did I mention that it's whisper quiet! If you are looking for a quiet baby monitor and you have a ton of electronic devices around, this is the monitor to get. Bar None.",5
"GroVia Cloth Wipes, 12 count","We have been using the GroVia line of diapers since our daughter was born two months ago.  We had found some wipes at a local shop that we love, but they where home made and did not have information on where to buy more.  After looking around on the internet, we decided to go with these wipes and I think we made the right choice.The wipes are the size of our house wash cloths.  They do seem to be made of a material that needs to be washed a handful of times to get maximum absorbency if you use water to wet the cloths before use.  (This is normal on most cotton diaper products.)  The wipes are very soft on one side and a little more scratchy on the other which is handy for the messier changes.I think that whenever we need to buy more wipes, this will be the brand we go with.",5
Lambs &amp; Ivy Dream Teddy Wallpaper Border 8''x30'',"As a  first time user of borders & wallpaper, this is not a one person task.  Instuctions OK, but because they don't tell you it is best to get a second person following the instructions maybe difficult.  When the border is wet for the ten second and applied to the wall, it is too loose and has a tendency to slide.  Because the border expands when wet, you want to do one complete section.  This does not work for a loner.  It's best to just get help.",4

"Re-Play 3 Count Bowls, Pink, Green, Orange","Really, these bowls are awesome.  They are thick and heavy.  The size and shape is great for toddlers.  I love that they're made from recycled materials.  The ONLY negative things I have to say is that I wish they could go in the microwave and I wish they could go on the bottom row of the dishwasher.  However, I knew both those negatives before I bought them and I wouldn't take back the decision.  Good buy.  Worth it.  Go for it.",4
"Delta Children's Products Silverton Sleigh 4 in 1 Crib, Dark Cherry","If you organize the parts before you start, it's not too tough to assemble. I had the biggest challenge installing the mattress support, but was tight on space.

"ERGObaby Wrap, Eucalyptus","Babywearing is a HUGE interest of mine (I am a VBE of a local babywearing group), so I jumped at the chance to try out ERGObaby's new wrap.  I started my wrapping days with a stretchy wrap, and I've tried a wide variety of wraps with my three children.  Unlike other popular stretchy wraps, the ERGObaby wrap WILL work with a heavier baby, and even on your back.  More on that later.The ERGObaby comes in a few color choices, and includes a pocket.  As for most baby carrier ""pockets"" I've tried, you can't really stuff a bunch of things inside, or anything especially bulky or poky, but it's a nice little add on for small things.  It also helps you collapse the ERGObaby wrap when it's not being worn.  I really liked the color of the Eucalyptus and Pepper wraps and found them both a good gender neutral color.  Inside is an instruction manual with one type of front carry.  I appreciate that ERGObaby doesn't intimidate the newer babywearer that might pick one of these up with lots of instructions.  Their webpage has a few more instructions, and, like I mentioned above, unlike other popular stretchy wraps, since the ERGObaby wrap is a *hybrid*, it is safe for back carries*.  I personally liked the double hammock (DH) carry.I tried the wrap out with my 5 year old and my friend's 6 month old daughter.  It was okay with my daughter (she's very leggy even if she's not very heavy), but it definitely worked well for my friend's daughter.  The nice thing about the hybrid wrap is that it's stretchy without being too stretchy or saggy.  My friend, anxious to try out the wrap, used it on her 4 year old son in a DH and really enjoyed the way it wrapped.  She even borrowed the wrap and used it for hours with her youngest, and she said that even with a sloppy pocket wrap cross carry, it was comfortable the whole time.It is a bit more expensive than some other stretchy wraps, but it's worth every penny.  Most stretchy wraps sag too much when your baby gets bigger, but the ERGObaby wrap doesn't!  It's also cheaper than most woven wraps, and can do many of the carries that woven wraps offer.  It is definitely a great baby shower present!  I wish the wraps came in other colors and patterns, but it's a very small complaint for such a great carrier.  The other small complaint some might have is that the fabric isn't going to be especially breathable (though it's definitely better than some other carriers), though no multi-layer carrier is going to really be cool when you're wrapping it around yourself and a warm baby.  The other huge drawback for some is that wraps have a large learning curve and the amount of fabric can be intimidating to some, though it's usually an obstacle that can be overcome with practice.*Please be cautious when learning how to back wrap.  I personally recommend attending a local babywearing group if you can, but if you can't, there are great videos online to help teach you how to back wrap.  You might want to practice over a bed or a soft couch and/or with a spotter to help ensure your child's safety, or practice with a stuffed animal or pillow.  Unless an experienced wrapper, I would not recommend back wrapping with a newborn.",5

Just one note on the ""Uptown Stripe"" print - the edges are brown (I'd thought they were black).",5
Mobi TykeLight Portable GloMate,"This was great to transition my daughter to sleeping without waking up scared all the time, it was light enough that it comforted her until she went to sleep and stayed lit long enough to make her feel secure. The bad part was that it quit working after 6 months but I will say it was well worth it to get the extra sleep!",4

"Mary Meyer Wubbanub Plush Pacifier, Cutsie Caterpillar","I first bought these when I again had to replace the 12 pacifiers that had gone missing. My daughter had grown accustom to the feel of the hospital brand pacifiers since she spent a couple of months there after birth. I came across these and bought them because they were super cute but was unsure if my daughter would like them. Previously I had bought pacifiers that looked like the ones the hospital provided but were not. The plastic used to make them were shiny and for whatever reason my daughter had no interest in them. I later discovered that the Gum Drop pacifiers were identical to the ones provided by hospitals. They have a vast variety of styles and colors likeGumDrop Pacifier Full-Term Natural Scent Orange 5 Packand Gum Drop Preemie Pacifier Vanilla Scent (Green) for preemies. These wubbanubs were in fact made of the same material and perfect for my little one. I only wished I had found them sooner since my other two children are grown. I could have saved myself from trips to the crib in the middle of the night to give baby back her pacifier. These pacifiers are perfect for little hands to find and grab in the middle of the night. My daughter just puts her own pacifier back in her mouth. I have yet to lose these unlike the gazillion other pacifiers I have purchased over the years. They make a great toy for baby as well. While the pacifier is in her mouth she tends to play with the plush and tag. It is a somewhat meditative motion that helps to sooth her and/or occupy her in her carseat/stroller/crib. So not only is it a pacifier and toy but it helps build motor skills. There are a number of different colors, animals and even textures, like this oneWubbanub Plush Pacifier Toy, Cutsie Caterpillar.  TheWubbaNub Tabby Kittenis my daughter's favorite. I have noticed that it is aslightly smaller than the others but she still grabs that one if given the option.  (And we all know that little babies have big personalities.) The pacifier itself is sewn very well to the plush, however, I usually cut the pacifier out after its seen some wear.  Just as a caution. Once you stitch the the hole back you have another little toy for baby to play with unlike the plain pacifiers that you have to dump.  They make great gifts and additions to a shower basket.  I have bought many for my friends.  When you think of the must haves in baby gear, I personally would add this to my list.Update: To wash or sterilize, I place a small plastic sandwich bag around the plush to prevent it from getting wet. I can then wash the pacifier with warm water and anti-bacterial soap or clean with a baby safe sterilizer.  Then I just take a sterile wipe or even a baby wipe to gently rub the plush doll.  It has worked well for me and keeps baby's gear germ free.",5
"No-Spill Cup w/ Soft Spout &amp; Handles, Neutral Colors",I bought 2 Nuby sippy cups hoping that they would work and at least not leak. The fact that it was easy to suck the drink out was the only reason it got any stars at all. The lid and ring do not fit properly. The silicon nipple part gaps up under the ring and eventually pops out causing leakage. Pretty pointless if you ask me. I am very disappointed in this product as I had high hopes for it.,2
"Graco ComfortSport Convertible Car Seat, Zara","We purchased the Graco ComfortSport at Target in Sept of 2010 as an emergency replacement for our previous carseat after an accident. (We actually got the Creighton model.) I have 3 major concerns about the safety of this seat:1) The shoulder straps do not tighten evenly. After looking at the back of the seat I realized this is due to the design of the set yoke; most seats have two individual hooks for the shoulder belts, tightened by a single pull strap. The ComfortSport overlaps the two shoulder straps under a single hook and one strap will always be a little looser than the other. This also crates the potential for the overlapping strap to slip out of the hook, as it is barely held in place by the hook.2) The chest plate is easy to unbuckle, even for young children. I looked up advice on how to solve this issue on Graco's website- apparently many parents were having the same issues and Graco's response was that parents should just explain to their children why they need to keep the belt on. After pulling over 10+ times on a two-hour trip because my 2 year old didn't understand my explaining on why this belt was intended to keep him safe, I settled on buying self-adhesive Ace wrap to wrap around the buckle so he couldn't mess with it.3) The tightening plate on our model broke after only 11 months of use. I was tightening the strap, as usuall, and the single screw the holds the plate in place pulled out and flew somewhere in the car. If this had happened during an accident, the shoulder straps would have been loosened about 2 inches and greatly reduced the protection of the seat.I had contaceted Graco regauding my concerns about the seat, and asking for a refund. They sent me a letter stating that if I had problems with their product, I should ship it to them at MY expense and they would replace the seat with another one of the same model- no refund. Needless to say I just went out and bought a different, better rated seat for my son.",2
Changing Table Pad - size: 17x34,"I really liked this pad.  The one that came with the changing table ripped just by getting my very short, non manicured, figure nails caught on the pad while picking the baby up.  This quilted version has been far more resilient to tears and looks prettier too.  Well worth the money.",5
Xpress Trainer Pro-All In One-Real Simple Potty Training Round/Standard Family Toilet Seat,"I purchased this seat for my two year old daughter, because she insisted on dumping the little one all by herself. I'm sure you can imagine the mess involved! Now with the help of a step stool she uses the ""big girl potty"" all by herself. I love it. The easy removal feature is great as well, it makes cleaning a breeze! I only gave it 4 stars because if she didn't sit back far enough she peed on the floor. It took her about a week to figure this out! It's a great seat! Well worth every penney!",4
Fisher-Price Precious Planet Whale of a Tub,"This is the best baby tub ever! I've been using this for my son since he was a few weeks old. It comes with an insert to help keep your baby upright and in place. You can decide how much you want your little one submerged in the water simply by how much you fill the tub. There is also a built in drain for you to let out water without having to take your baby out. My son loves to lay on his back and kick his legs freely in the water - He's almost 3 months now and is still using the insert, but as soon as he can sit up on his own, I'll take the insert out. I love the cute little whale cup it comes with - its perfect for rinsing his hair.Bath time has become my son's favorite because of this little tub! I plan on using this until he grows out of it. The quality and price just can't be beat. And the convenience of not having to clean my tub everytime I want to bathe my son is great! This little tub is perfect and I highly recommend it!",5
"Maison Chic Jersey Blankie, Dog","I started using this ""lovey"" with my daughter when she turned 4 months old (she is now 8 months).  She had horrible sleep initiation issues and was not one to take a pacifier, so at the suggestion of the book, ""The No Cry Sleep Solution,"" a lovey became one of the tools I used in my bag of tricks for getting my little one to sleep.  She immediately took to her bunny and has used it for every nap and bedtime since.  Because she sucks on the arms to fall asleep, I have to wash her lovies quite often (she has two identical ones- they get alternated based on which one is cleaner).  Despite many washing and runs through the dryer, they have held up.  I just ordered two more though since I don't know how many (almost) daily washing they can take without eventually falling apart and I don't want to be stuck without her lovey!I choose this one over the more plush ones I found because it seemed like less of a suffocation risk.  That's not to say that early on I didn't frequently remove it from her face as she fell asleep with it.  Now that she's older, she doesn't put it over her head anymore and if she does, she easily removes it herself.",5

Long-Range Vibrating Baby Monitor,"We have had this monitor for almost three years now.  We used it for about 1 1/2 years and then put it away until our third child came along.  The monitor doesn't hold its charge, and we cannot hear anything unless the volume dial is turned up high.  It also emits crackling and static when the dial is touched.  We probably will have to buy another monitor because it drives me crazy every time I try to adjust it.",2
Cybex Aton Infant Car Seat (2013) - Heavenly Blue,Best car seat this is our 5th Cybex wouldn't buy any other brand! Plus I love all the colors.  People always stop and ask me where I purchased it.  It is really unique looking and one of the lightest and well made on the market.  Mine fits into my bugaboo stroller with the maxi cosi stroller adapter.  It's a nice combo it sits up really high unlike most strollers and since my husband and I are tall it's a back saver.,5
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe Microfleece, Small, Blue",I loved the idea behind this but you really only want to use this when they are small and the size small was still to big for my son to be swaddled tightly enough to create the comfort he needed. He was 7lb6oz (which isn't even that small). They should really make a preemie size or make the small a little smaller.,3

Safety 1st 900 Mhz Sight And Sound Nursery Monitor System,"We have this monitor and I could not live without it. I cant imagine not being able to see my daughter at night if I hear her making noise. The camera works great and the picture is clear. I have noticed that if I move the camera to certain areas of the crib the reception will suffer so you have to get the camera in just the right spot. The handheld unit works great throughout the house (3600sqft)although it doesnt work if I go out in the driveway, I bought a cheap $20 one that takes care of that. This product has worked great for us!",4

"Dream On Me Ashton 4 in 1 Convertible Crib, Cherry","After my first born, I was trying to buy something a little more affordable the second time around when I came across this crib. Not only is it at a decent price, it also is very beautiful, and easy to assemble. Although, the pieces were not marked, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how to put this crib together. The picture diagram is pretty self explanatory. The cherry color crib was right on mark when it came to color and its wood is very beautiful and has a very clean form. When purchasing the crib, I decided to also buy the mattress and waterproof mattress cover recommended by Amazon which I got all at a great price and everything fit perfectly together. I received 2 of the 3 packages on the same day and the last package a week later, but always before the original shipping date. I was very satisfied with my crib choice and can't wait to use it for my baby!",4

At first they were a little small so I wrapped a blanket in the seat to keep them snug and put a pillow in the base so their feet had something to rest on.

That and the clear roller were their favorites.Easy to put togetherDurable PlasticThe toys are removeable for easy cleaning/washing and some can be switched around.The seat cover was secure but easy enough to removed to wash.Seat spins easliy.Easy height adjustmentThe only things I noticed:Rocks without the foot pegs. Didn't come with. I used a rolled up towel to stabilize it. I guess I could have called the manufacturer to get them like others have.Hard to wipe clean with all the toys attached. Luckily the toys easily detach to resolve this but would have like it better if I could give a quick wipe down without having to dismantle it.Big footprint.

Vulli Chan Pie Gnon Natural Rubber Teether - Blue Chan,"I bought this for my son after we lost Sophie since he's less expensive. My son enjoys teething on him but seems to have liked Sophie better. It's still great that this is made from natural rubber and food-based paint and don't have to worry about him chewing on it. It's really cute, too.",4
Evenflo Comfort Select Manual Breast Pump,"My old Avent Isis that my sister loaned to me broke, so I went out looking for a replacement.  I selected this Evenflo pump, because it seemed to look the most like the Isis.  Apparently, all pumps are NOT created equal.  When I used to pump with the Isis, my milk came out so easily, quickly, and with no discomfort.  With this one, after about 20 minutes I had only one ounce out of each, my hand was so tired, and I was sore.  Didn't seem to matter which setting I had it on, or whether I had the horn insert in or not.  It also recommended hand expressing to begin with, before I began pumping...but didn't really think that was practical, since most of the time I will be using this in public bathrooms, while my little one is at home with Dad.  I went online and spent the extra $ to order a new Avent Isis.",2
Guidecraft Tan Storage Bins (Set of 5),"I was a little disappointed at the tiny size of these baskets.They're not suitable for bookshelf, big plush toys and so on.So I use them for storing baby's clothes in a dresser.It works better as divisions for separating clothes, socks.",4
"Sunshine Kids Radian80Sl Convertible Car Seat, Shadow","We love our Radian carseats!  We bought this one for our son, after getting one for our daughter and falling in love with it.  They are narrow and we can sit them side by side in the car so that when he fusses (8 months), she will hold his hand for us, give him his paci back, and sing him songs.  Such a lifesaver!!",5
Avent Easy Breast Milk Containers - Set of 4,"the easy bresast milk cointainer are really helpfull, I'm in love because it preserves the milk really well. milk directly to the bottle!",5
Safety 1st Expandable Table Edge Bumper,"This fits our table well, it's a little loose around the sides, but very secure in the corners. It has saved our little girl from getting a few head bumps and she can't take it all off like she could with just corner protectors so I would recommend it.",4
Sweet Jojo Designs Baby and Kids Clothes Laundry Hamper - Pink and Brown Modern Polka Dots,"I ordered this hamper with the hopes that it would somewhat go with my Pottery Barn nursery set, and was pleasantly surprised.(The Sophie set- polka dots) Its not an exact match, but it does the trick! These hampers aren't the most sturdy, but they definitely get the job done, and I would order from them again!.",4
"Pickles Nummy Animal Snuggly Banky, Pink Bunny, 16 X 16&quot;",I am so glad I found this because my son & daughter each have their own and carry them all over the place. Unfortunately my son lost his so I was so happy when I found one that matched his & I found this one to match my daughter's just in case she accidentally misplaces hers.,5
Baby Bjorn Toilet Trainer,"This is a great purchase from an experienced mom!  I have used many potty seats in the past, but this one just makes sense.  It is so easy to clean and move on and off.  We have an elongated seat that none of the cheaper seat covers would fit. I started my daughter on the big potty (my little experiment) and she is doing great with this seat!  Highly recommend this seat for both boys and girls!Mom from AZ",5
"Safety 1st Crystal Clear Baby Monitor, White","I bought this for us to be able to hear my daughter when we went outside for a smoke break. It worked at first, but when we moved her to her own room it stopped working. Not going to buy this monitor again.",1
"Summer Infant Character Change Pad Cover, Butterfly Ladybug",This was a great purchase!  It fits the changing pad perfectly.  It is so soft and it washes great.  I just bought another one!,5
Earlyears Roll n Swirl Ball Ramp,"Bought this for a one year old and her three year old sister LOVED it! I am hoping the younger one will show interest in it one day. For now, the big sister is having a ball with it!",5
"ERGObaby Heart2Heart Infant Insert, Natural",This insert worked perfectly for my first baby and we used it almost daily for walks or even to be close while doing chores around the house. It washes and dries well - holds it s shape. The only complaint I have is that I could never figure out how to make the adjustable closure stay synched after I snapped it in place.,5

Parents Units Super Stopper for Windows and Doors,"I really wanted this to work. Five minutes after I put these on the window my 10 month old climbed up on our ground level window sills and pulled them right off. I left two on a high window for a couple of days until my mother (who didn't realize they were there) opened the window right up with very little resistance, leaving the stoppers in place. We're still trying to find a solution that doesn't involve bars.",1
"Samsung SEW-3037W Wireless Pan Tilt Video Baby Monitor Infrared Night Vision and Zoom, 3.5 inch",This monitor works seamlessly right out of the box. Great viewing angles and visuals are clear in both daylight and at night. I have no complaints thus far.- M. Salzman,5
"American Baby Company Organic Embroidered Receiving Blanket, Mocha","I'm so surprised that someone thought this blanket was rough. How is that possible? The fabric is super soft - almost buttery! I love how it's stretchy and drapes so well. It just hangs down and stays where you put it. The sewn on teddy bear is not scratchy at all. The blanket is on the small side, a good size for swaddling a newborn. Now that my little one is older, I keep it in the diaper bag as an all purpose blanket, cover, etc. Because the fabric is so stretchy and drapes so well, it stays compact in the diaper bag. Highly recommended (unless you don't buy items from China).",5
"Britax B-Agile Fashion Stroller Kit, Cowmooflage","great product, makes  the stroller more comfy and breaks the solid color of the b agile stroller. easy to take off and wash, no re threading needed.",5
"Tiny Love Take-Along Arch, Sunny Stroll",Completely happy with the product. It keeps baby busy. Easy to attach it to the stroller and carseat. I even attached it to playmat.I would recommended it.,5
Tot Lok Deluxe Set PLUS One Spare Magnetic Key,our cabinets are a little thicker than normal so you have to really hit the spot to get these to open but we've gotten used to it.  I also added a rare earth magent to the end of it from a hard drive I took apart.  The stronger magnet makes it much easier to use.I love the design in that my kids can't get in.  That is the main point but we also have to be able to get in so that's why I went with 4 stars rather than 5.,4
"The First Years Indigo Stroller, Red","The Indigo stroller is lovely to look at, and everywhere I took it it got a lot of attention. Its features are great: it has a high, Euro-style seat, and the reversible seat is a terrific concept, and hard to find at a reasonable price. However, I sent the stroller back after one month of use. The wheels began to squeak on our first walk. No amount of grease would stop the squeaking, and it became so loud it drew stares from across the street. Then, after three weeks of use, the front wheels began to lock up so severely that the stroller would suddenly come to a stop and pitch forward. The seam on the parent console, which is made of cloth, ripped, rendering it useless and ugly. The Indigo collapses in two parts; the seat must be detached from the unit in order to fold it down, making it hard to collapse swiftly, and bulky in the car. The other flaw in the Indigo is its low head clearance. My average-height two-year-old bumped his head on the the canopy. I was willing to overlook this drawback because I planned to use the stroller more for my infant, but the wheels were a deal-breaker.",1
"NUK Toddler Tooth and Gum Cleanser, 1.4 Ounce, (Colors May Vary)","Our 18 month old mimics his older brother and brushes his teeth alongside him, and this brush is the perfect shape and size for his little hands!",5
"RayShade&reg; UV Protective Stroller Shade Improves Sun Protection for Strollers, Joggers and Prams Black","This shade work great on my jogger stroller, keeps my son well shaded, it covers almost double what the stroller shade did. I didn't give it a 5 star because it doesn't work with umbrella strollers, the straps are spaced to far apart and you can't get it tight enough. Also it says you can fold it into itself like a pocket, but doesn't give instructions and neither my husband or I could figure out how to do it.",4
Nuby 2-Pack 8 oz No Spill Cup with Super Spout (Color may vary),"I wish I could give this zero stars. The handles get in the way so it's hard to screw the lid on. The threads on the lid and base almost never line up properly, making it leak constantly. I get my hands all covered in apple juice just trying to get the thing set so my toddler can drink.",1
Fisher-Price: Link-a-doos Open-Top Take-Along Swing,"My son screamed whenever we put him in the swing from birth to 2-3 months.  Now at 4 months, he will tolerate it, but only for short periods of time.  Some friends lent us their full size Graco swing and he loves that one!My biggest complaint is that the seat isn't supportive and too reclined.  My son is much happier in the molded plastic seat with padding so he can sit up straight and see what's going on.  Also, the mechanism that makes it swing gets knocked off easily when the swing is moved from place to place and it will just stop swinging.We're all much happier with the full size swing.",2
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Freeflow Pacifier, 6-18 Months,  Colors and Designs May Vary, 2-Count",Very cute! Gender neutral and easy to locate in the dark - as opposed to the clear ones. This is baby's favorite pacifier.,5
"JL Childress 6 Bottle Cooler, Black",It didn't fit 6 bottles. I went on a trip and it only fit 3 bottles and they were tall and skinny. It also didn't keep my stuff cold. I wouldn't buy it again.,3

"My Brest Friend Twins Plus Deluxe Nursing Pillow, Green, 0-12 Months","I bought this based on the reviews and have tried to use it multiple times in the 4+ months I've been feeding twins.  I'm not tiny (size 12), but can't get it tight enough so there ends up being a large gap in front.  I can't get it to sit high enough so I end up hunched over.  I also can't figure out the ""back support"".  It is awful in every situation.  Doesn't even double as something else I can use for them.The Twin Z nursing pillow is better (still not perfect - had to add snaps on latch system because buckles don't get it tight enough, have to use pillow under because it isn't tall enough, and it is getting flatter).  But it is muli-purpose and more comfortable.Wish I'd spent the money I spent on this on something else.",2
"babyletto Madison Swivel Glider, Mocha","I bought this because I never put my feet up, even when nursing, and I didn't want one of the traditional gliders for my daughter's room.  This is much more stylish looking, and I can use it in other parts of the house since it actually looks nice.  I love that it can swivel all around.  We read books in it too.  I use a small pillow at the base of my back to make it a little more comfortable.",5
KinderGlo Owl Portable Fun and Safe Rechargeable Night Light,My daughtER loves this night light. It's the perfect size and gives off just the right amount of light from her room. I didn't give it a 5 for 2 reasons 1:the charger is temperamental. The night light has to be sitting just right on it for it to charge. 2: you can not have it on the charger and have it on all night long. As soon as you put it on the charger it triggers the 30 min timer. It does stay on all night without staying on the charger tho so this isn't a big deal to me.,4
"Keekaroo Height Right Kids High Chair, Natural","Attention: This chair is not what is listed in the description (6 months and up). There are two Keekaroo chairs sold by Amazon that are exactly the same except this one doesn't come with a tray and you cannot buy the tray separately. I was quickly price shopping and didn't realize that this chair does not come with the tray. Because the tray is not sold separately, I need to ship the whole box back and exchange for the chair with the tray to make it useful for a 6 month old.The chair is really nice though, which is why I'll go through the hassle of the exchange. It's solid and very well made. It is the 'right height' to scoot up to the dining room table once your child id old enough to sit at the table without a tray. If you're looking for a high chair to put in the kitchen however, and feed your baby while standing up, this isn't the right chair for you because it won't be tall enough.",4
"Ultimate Silicone Teething Feeder - Safe for your Infant - Allow Baby to Self Feed Fresh or Frozen Fruit and Other Food While Massaging His or Her Gums - Soothe the Pain of Teething - Easy to Clean Silicone Sac- Money Back Guarantee, Large, Light Blue/Dark Blue",This is the best design out there.

Jolly Jumper Snuggle Cover for Soft Baby Carriers - Black,I highly recommend this item. I use it with the Ergo carrier. I love how easy it is to slip on over my head. It covers her well. Perfect for rain or snow. Love that I don't always have to put her in a bulky snowsuit.,5
"Dream On Me Karley Bassinet, Pink",Because it's everything that I wanted for her it keep her worm it can keep the bus away and it so adorable.I just love it it's so cute and pretty thank so much.,5
"Britax Monarch Booster Car Seat, Royal Racer","We really like this carseat.  I kept my daughter in a 5 point harness as long as I could, but was finally ready for the transition.  I like the fact it can be one unit or just the bottom.  She really likes the side head rests- she had them on her older Britax carseat as well.  Like many of the other posts have said-  I agree the cupholders are useless.  It's to bad they couldn't come up with a more clever design for the cupholders or even add a personal reading light.  Many other carseats offer more of these ""extras"", but I can't give up the safety of the Britax.  I do wish, that it would have come with the Latch system though.  I really like the security of knowing that the seat isn't going anywhere.",4
Boon Flair Harness/Buckle,"This is a great buckle for your child especially if he's a big boy. Either way, its a lot better than any standard one.",5
"Regalo Easy Step Walk Thru Gate, White",Works as advertised.  Probably not best choice if you will be putting up and taking down often but still not difficult. Walk through cate is good idea and latch is secure.,4
'Medela 21mm Personalfit Breastshield 2-pack (Non-retail Packaging),"I bought these to use with my Medela pump when the standard size that is included didn't work well for me. If you have large breasts, don't think that you need a larger size. I have DD breasts, and going down in size is the only way I could pump effectively.",5
"Safety 1st Travel Ease Deluxe Playard, Marina",I got this one for the pattern bc I plan on having another one and it goes both ways.  The changing table part of it is a bit difficult bc it kinda leans or tilts sideways but I never used it anyways so it didn't bother me but if u plan on using it just be aware of that. It's useable and u will get used tout but it does tilt a bit,5
"The First Years Soft Grip Trainer Seat, Blue",i have owned other potty seats... and training toilets...tjis one is one piece molded plastic...easy to clean  and store...it does the job great of makingthe big potty fit a little child...great buy,5
Lamaze Spin &amp; Explore Garden Gym,"My little one has never been interested in tummy time.  I purchased this in hopes of making it a little more exciting for him and it worked!  He loves looking at himself in the mirror or listening to the crinkle of the leaves or wings when his hands move over them.  I know he's not meaning to just yet, but he's been able to move himself around and has been able to enjoy all the sections of this gym.I would highly recommend it for babies who are less than happy with tummy time!",5
"My Brest Friend Angled Feeding Pillow, Green","This works so well. Way better than any traditional pillow shape. It cuts down on spit up, and help with easier burping. I also don't feel so hunched over As I did with traditional pillows. The cover is very soft. I would say it's almost too soft because my baby has a tendency to slide down it.",5
"PBnJ baby Paci Holder, Big Pink/Purple Dots",My husband loves this things. They do get the job done. However i get tired of them getting tangled with things.... I guess it is a matter of preference :),3
Dreambaby Cable Lock,"I am a kid-proofing pro, as I have an autistic 17 year old boy in the house.  Problem is, typical kid-proofing pieces are all plastic and he can just rip those babies off.  My refrigerator is a constant problem, and I searched a long time.  Bicycle cable locks are way too long, and although I found a keyed padlock with a hasp just long enough to go over the french door handles, I was terrified of losing the key.  This combo cable is adjustable and strong, and no key to lose.  I can change the combination if ever I need to as well!",5
"Playtex Drop-Ins Premium Nurser Bottle, 4 Ounce (Colors and packaging may vary)","We really like these bottles. Our daughter was having major gas issues and these bottles have helped. You can warm them. I press out the air and then put in a cup of hot water to warm. Or, I put the bottle in the microwave (no cap, just the bottle and liner) for about 15-20 seconds and it works great. The system is not perfect (have to buy liners, not a lot of room if you are making 4 oz of formula if you are mixing in the bottle) but it's still very good. One less thing to wash is a plus too.",4
Safety 1st Sleepy Baby Nail Clipper,"Not only is the light on these clippers a life saver, they clip better than any others I've tried.  My twins scratch themselves up if I don't keep on top of their nails and this has helped me do so more than anything else I have tried.",5
Baby Trend Diaper Champ,"I'm not sure about this one.  In concept, it's a fabulous idea.  I love that you don't have to purchase expensive refills.  I just go to [the store] and purchase tall kitchen bags and use those for the Diaper Champ.  The cons, at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth.  In addition, I don't believe that it is odorless.  My daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor...I'm concerned that as she gets older the #2 diapers will only get worse.  If I had to do it over again, even with the cost savings of using any type of bag, I would go w/ the Diaper Genie.",3
"Soft Gear My Booster Seat, Mint","We bought this for my just-turned 3 year old and every mealtime we have to kick her siblings (5 and 7) out of it. It's very comfortable and wipes clean. We have wooden chairs with a bit of contour to them. I kneel in the booster to get a tight seal...you don't have to, it will still stay put when they're climbing in and out, but it's really secure if you do. It's easy to throw in the car to take to grandma's and no straps to deal with or get food on! Wish we had this years ago.",5
Chicco Cortina Stroller Explorer,"I bought this stroller for $129.00 and receieved it today. It was pretty easy to put together. This is my 4th stroller in 14 months (yes I am very picky) and this one by far is the best! I have owned a Britax Forerunner stroller, Fisher-Price Infant to Toddler stroller and an Inglesina Espresso Stroller and now a Chicco Cortina!Pros:Large Storage BasketChild trayParent TrayEasy to open and close/foldWindow that you can actually see your child through!Well-made and designedSmooth rideBig but not too wide or bulkyComfortable/padded seatStands by itself when in folded positionAnd many extra little featuresCons:HeavyNot very compactManual does not state how to use the multi-position canopy to were is moves completely forward as pictured and stated on boxGreat buy, the very best by far!!!",5

Hard Rock Cloth Diaper &amp; Laundry Detergent - Motley Clean,Jus did not get our diapers clean. They always felt like there was a lot of residue left over. Not for us I like our diapers clean.,1
"Kushies 6 Pack Wash Cloth Set, White","These are very small!  I know I'm washing a baby, but these are so small they are hard to hold onto.  They also curl up when you wash them making them difficult to fold. Material is fine, but these are shoved in the back of the drawer & not used.",2
"Stork Craft Hoop Glider and Ottoman, White/Beige","I wasn't willing to spend a lot of money on a glider.  This glider is perfect for me.  It was packaged well. The directions were easy and it only took my husband about 15-20 mins to put together.  I purchased the beige cushions with the white frame.  The color was exactly what I expected it to be. The glider will go well in my nursery.  I should also mention that it glides smoothly.  Some reviewers have complained about the smallish size, but with my feet on the ottoman it isn't noticable (I'm 5'6). The back cushion is quite comfortable. I am happy with my purchase.",4
"Philips AVENT BPA Free Animal Pacifier, 0-6 Months, Style and Color May Vary, 2-Pack",I only buy the event brand pacifiers because that is the only kind my son likes. Great product at a great price!,5
BABYBJORN Original Carrier - City Black,"I absolutely love my Baby Bjorn.  I have used it with my two babies and I cannot reccommend this item highly enough.  I have used the Baby Bjorn more hours than my 3 strollers combined.It is a little difficult to get the hang of the straps at first but once everything is adjusted correctly, it is very simple.  Both of my babies were in the carrier by 4 weeks in a rear facing set up.  They both loved being so close to me and I loved having my hands free to cook or walk.I turned them both around to face forward around 3 months but would sometimes turn them back around once they fell asleep.My first baby outgrew the carrier around 9 months because he was too heavy and too long but I still use it with my second baby who just turned a year.After three years of use, the carrier functions perfectly but the black color has faded and it looks a little beat up.  I have washed the front cushion part many times due to teething and spit up.  It washes very well.I hope you and your babies enjoy your Baby Bjorn as much as we did!",5
Pretty Pony Horse Toddler Bedding 5 pc set by Sweet Jojo Designs,"My little horse lover loves this bedding. I am picky about liking stuff that is cotton and this set has a great cotton feel, soft and comfy.  The stitching is well done and having the horses made out of different material makes them really stand out. (they are quilted on not painted.)  The pillow, bottom sheet and top sheet are all 3 pink with pink gingham trim on the pillow and top sheet.  My only complaint is the top sheet is a little small, while it will tuck in it won't stay tucked in on both sides when my little one is in bed.  If your kid likes a bed with one tucked side this should work great, but for my daughter who likes to sleep in a double tucked bed we have had to rely on tucking the comforter to make it like she likes it.",5
"Kolcraft Contours Options Tandem Stroller, Ruby",I am very happy with this stroller.. It fits easily in the back of my trunk.. I bought an additional car seat attachment since the stroller just comes with one.  I always just put the babies in the carseats and put them into the attachments on the stroller and we're good to go!  It has a LOT of room at the bottom.  Enough to store the diaper bag and my purse (and bags if you are shopping)!! I keep my keys and phone in between the cup holders (bottle holders).  I would highly recommend. Just remember to light the handle bars UP before trying to close the stroller.,5
Safe-Plate Outlet Cover - 25pk - Almond,These covers were too thick for my outlets.  When installed the progs on plug were not able to get far enough into the outlet to get power.,1
"Kiddopotamus SwaddleMe 100% Cotton Knit, Small, Circle Bear","We tried many different types of swaddle blankets (e.g. the Miracle Blanket, etc.) and the Kiddopotamus was the only one that worked right.The Miracle Blanket definitely kept our baby swaddled, but it literally took 2 of us to get it on her correctly, and it was such an ordeal that she was very upset by the time we were finished.  In contrast, the Kiddopotamus is extremely easy to work with and wraps your baby up very quickly.My only word of advice is to buy the cotton knit instead of the flannel.  We thought that the cotton knit would stretch more than the flannel (and indeed it does), but we thought this would make the cotton knit less effective (as in the baby would be able to get out more easily); however, what we found is that the stretchiness allows you to wrap it more tightly and effectively than the cotton flannel.Also out of 3 flannel ones we bought, 2 tore holes in them very promptly.  And even though the cotton knit was used probably 10 times more often than the flannel, it never tore a hole.",5
"Baby Jogger 2011 City Mini Single Stroller, Black/Black","My husband and I love this stroller.We purchased the infant car seat converter, and have used this stroller from day one.  Once the converter was installed, it was easy to transfer the carrier from the car to the stroller and back again.Now that baby is 7 months old, we strap her in without the infant seat.  It is easy to strap her in and she sits comfortably.  The full recline is great; she has napped in there easily on long trips, especially because we can also move the large canopy to almost completely cover her while she's in there.As a small-framed woman, it is also easy for me to remove and set up the stroller.  The one strap fold is genius!  This is like a light BOB, but an extra-souped up umbrella stroller at the same time.  We don't foresee needing another stroller for a long time.The only cons are that the storage is lacking (and inaccessible when baby is in full recline) and that it doesn't come with any ""extras"" (cup holder, etc.).  We have done fine without them so far, but will probably need to splurge on them soon (when we take baby on trips to theme parks, the zoo, etc.).Caveat: this is our first baby and the only stroller we've purchased, but for first-time, inexperienced parents, it has been a lifesaver.",5
"Prince Lionheart weePOD Basix, Ash Grey","Comfy and doesn't get pee everywhere! After going thru quite a few potty seats, this is my favorite one! It's a pretty color, super comfy for your LO and it stays clean! Only wish it had a hook for the toilet tank.",5
"Dena Happi Tree Hamper, Pink","This Hamper turned out to be very nice, it seems well made/sturdy and holds a lot...enough for more than a week of infant clothes.",5
Sassy Clarified Fascination Station Suction Toy,"The suction cup completely fails.  Does not work at all. Received this item as a gift, would have given it 1 star but when I hold it in my hand my son likes playing with it.  It's just completely useless unless I'm holding it because if he holds it he will end up wacking himself in the mouth with it.  Fix the suction cup and it would be an AMAZING toy.",2
"Bumbleride Travel Bag for Indie, Black",We just finished our sixth flight with this bag and it has always protected our Indie Bumbleride and the bag still looks like new.  We've only checked it at the ticket counter so I imagine it takes a beating.  I find it easy to put in and out of the bag and have never had a problem with it fitting in the bag.  I watched a how-to video online and practiced at home the first time.It would be good to have more labeling that the bag contains a stroller but I do it myself using paper tape/marker.  The price is a bit steep but it's worth the investment so you don't have to replace your stroller.,4
"Baby Starters Plush Snuggle Buddy, Blue Monkey",For me it doesn't worth $10.00. At Walmart it should be less than $5.00 including taxes. True that it is pink and soft but clearly not worth giving 5 stars.,2
green sprouts by i play. Sprout Ware Infant Spoon - Boy - 10 pk,It is small as it should be for little babies that are eating solids for the first time. My baby is really happy with these spoons.,5
"Kid'Sleep Classic, Blue","My daughter was waking up earlier and earlier in the morning and would not go back to sleep.  My wife and I tried everything to get her to stay quite until everybody else in the family woke up but to no avail.  We thought we would try this clock as a last ditch effort and to our amazement after about a week our daughter """"got it"""" and would be quite until the cow would """"wake up"""".  This has definitely been a huge blessing for us and we highly recommend it.",5
"Burlington Baby Moses Basket with Liner, White",This bassinet was exactly what I needed. I wanted a bassinet that was larger in size since my babies tend to be large when they are born and the smaller bassinets are too small in just a few weeks. This bassinet is very spacious and easy to move around your home. I love it!!!,5
"Kids Line Dena Happi Tree Velour Changing Pad Cover, Pink",We bought this net because my daughter has several stuffed animals that she isn't willing to part with but she hardly ever plays with them. I got so tired of picking them up everyday so I finally found this product! It is really big and durable and holds all of her animals (around 20-30) some of them being a little heavier as well (electronic toys). Does exactly what I wanted it to do and doesnt sag or fall down at all!,5
Graco SnugRider Infant Car Seat Stroller Frame,"We were given a very nice Graco car seat and base for our new baby, so we didn't want to register for an entire new travel system, but we liked the idea of the convenience for those occasions when we do need a stroller.The stroller frame was very easy to assemble. I'm petite, and getting it in and out of the car is very easy for me, though it does take two hands to fold and unfold. The car seat attaches securely and it feels sturdy. My only major complaint is that the ride is very rough on asphalt, so it isn't good for walking with my baby in the neighborhood for exercise.This product meets our needs and was a good buy.",4
"Stork Craft Hoop Glider, Cherry/Beige","When the glider arrived, we found out that one hole on the back frame, through which the armrest is fastens to the back frame, was missing.Then, we ordered a replacement.When the replacement came, both of the two upper horizontal bars of the base were broken.I am done with it. very disappointed.",1
Loopy Baby Rattle Holder - Pink &amp; Brown Damask,"I was very disapointed with the item, when we first got it, it was great, my daughter lost her first sophie so this was great till about two weeks later when the stitching came apart and now it can't be used any longer...",1
Jeep Wrangler Twin Sport All-Weather Umbrella Stroller,"We have three children, ages 2 mos to 3 years, and we use this stroller with all three. The seats fold down flat enough that, with use of the seat belt and a head support, our infant does just fine in it. Our 2 year and 3 year old love it because they can sit side by side and talk, share snacks, etc. The only problem we have had with it is that, in 18 mos worth of serious wear and tear (i.e. a dozen plane trips, two vacations, and weekly use at the zoo), the clip that holds it together when folded has gotten warped and so sometimes pops off. The cure? We wrap a luggage strap around it when flying- the rest of the time it is no big deal.We actually have a double jogging stroller (which cost 3x as much) that, while we loved it for about 2 mos), we haven't used since our second child was 3 mos old. It is big and bulky, and it much more difficult to maneuver. The Jeep double umbrella stroller has been great.",5
"Bumkins Waterproof Starterbib, Blue Fizz","I bought this thinking it was a Superbib.  We have 2 Superbibs and love them.  This product popped up when I searched for ""superbib"" and the picture looks like my Superbib.  But it's not.  If you are looking for a superbib, do not buy this product.  I am giving it 5 stars however, because Bumkin bibs are awesome and my gripe is with the labelling of this product.",5
Tiny Love Spin Ball Toy,My little one loves to play with this. It is smaller than I expected but it was perfect for her little hands and she loved the noise that makes when the sides click-clack together.,5
"Safety 1st Clic It Universal Infant Car Seat Carrier,  Black/Silver",Can you use this with a toddler convertible car seat?? I need a travel system but was wondering if I can purchase this and use it with a toddler car seat,5
The Original Tummy Tub Baby Bath - Clear,"As a new grandmother, but a well experienced mom, baby sitter and licensed day care provider, this is the best baby tub I've used.  Bought one for m'new grand baby... and keep it handy, because he loves it!  Follow directions: tepid water, not to exceed the clearly marked water line, and hold up the little tyke's chinny-chin-chin!  And voila!  Your baby will love it!  The serene look on our wee one's face told the story.  Just before we popped him in, he was howling... when he found himself in the water, he smiled!  Must be reminiscent of being in the womb!  I'm keeping this tub for the next baby... after that, I'll use it for a flower pot!  Won't his college friends love to hear the story!?",5
DEX Products Pregnancy Pillow PP-01,I tried to use this while pregnant but for me it was too thick and firm.  However it did make a great tool for propping up our newborn's mattress because he needs to sleep elevated due to reflux.,2
"Dream On Me Full Size 2 in 1 Folding Stationary Side Crib, Espresso","Unless you just have to have a folding crib, don't buy from this company.  The product is just ok once assembled but the instructions are less than adequate.  They're printed on the bottom of the crib, not in a booklet with pictures as you would expect.  In addition, the original order came with the plastic sealed container of screws, nuts, bolts, washers, etc. torn open and some pieces missing.  When I requested replacements, I received a 5&#34; x 7&#34; cardboard container stuffed with miscellaneous parts.  I finally broke down and bought the washers I needed.Assembly was an expected pain but once you figure out the pattern, it goes relatively smoothly.  I did split a piece of one rail because all the screws were one size instead of 2 different sizes listed on the parts list and I wound up using the larger screw.  All in all, not worth the money.",2
Bella B Stretch Mark Prevention Stick,"The scent is nice. However, it is greasy and sticky and stays that way all day. I do not like how it makes my skin feel on the outside, but I am sure it's doing good things for it. I wouldn't let any clothes come into contact with it that I care about. There's not much of the product so I'll probably use it until it's gone (I give it 2 months max) and then try something new.",3
"Britax Frontier 85 Combination Booster Car Seat, Red Rock","I bought 2 of the Britax Frontier seats for my 5 yr old daugher & my 6 1/2 yr old son and they are by far the best seats I've had so far.  They were pretty easy to install if your car has the latches & the tether hooks.  I installed them myself without any help from my husband and had both of them done in about 45 minutes.  Once installed, they are very secured.  I love the harness of these carseats because they do give a lot of slack when you need it and the buckle that sits on the seat can be adjusted accordingly to my kids height and size.  All the carseats I've had, the harness straps are designed in such a way that they are hard to buckle and there is never enough slack so my kids feel tight and uncomfortable.  I did a lot of research before I decided on Britax.  And I am very happy with my decision because of the ease of use and the safety features of this carseat.  My kids love the seats and they said they are very comfortable.  And the harness straps are easy to buckle and get in and out of so no more struggling to get them strapped down anymore.",5
Clippasafe Natural Wooden Playpen with Mat,"My neice just had a new baby and she and husband loves this item for her. Thank you very much amazon, and Hello baby",5
,"I looked for ages to find a solution for sectioning off our basement .... this arrived and fit the bill perfectly. It was easy to configure and install - we have fixed it at either end.I was initially disappointed with the taupe colour (a light grey) - white would have been better - but it is not offensive and actually doesn't annoy me as I thought it might.It is rigid enough for our 11 month old to pull up on without a problem, the gate is easy to operate with one hand which is important when carrying an infant.The only reason it doesn't score a 5* rating is that it doesn't lock in position completely which would have made it 100%.  It is possible to move it slightly when it is in position but that's not a really great issue for us so far.We did decide to purchase a Regalo 4 in 1 gate for the family room fireplace as it comes with the 8 panels we need without the need to purchase an extension set, however that is going straight back (I have reviewed that separately) and we have just ordered the Superyard with extension set - it is well worth the additional cost based on its appearance, quality and gate latch and I will happily live with the taupe colour!",4
Hygeia EnJoye EPS Breast Pump with External Power Supply,"i received this pump through the wic program. This electric pump is great. I've been using it for 3months now. My favorite part about the Hygeia pump is you can record your baby's hungry cry on it. Just hold the record button down next to ur baby and let go when your finished press play. The cry help stimulate me to produce more milk in order to pump more milk out. i also like the speed setting that the Hygeia Enjoye has as well, for those rush days at work. And if you do not have a power source it comes with its own battery pack to go wireless. Its light and easy to carry around but very big for a pump. The Hygeia pump can also be use as a single pump as well. Overall I will recommend this product to anyone.",5
"Carters Keep Me Dry Flannel Bassinet Pad, Green/Yellow","I bought this for baby's stroller bassinet, in which she also sleeps at night. We cut it down to perfectly match the shape of the oval mattress, which it protected perfectly from the occasional mid-sleep diaper explosion. So happy with this purchase that we bought it in a bigger size to protect the crib.",5
Combi Dakota Booster Car Seat Pattern: Jade,"I don't think this seat is as good as the reviews I've read.  It's fine, just not spectacularly comfortable, etc.  My daughter is 4 1/2 years old, 40 inches tall and just at the 33 pound requirement for this seat.  (most are 40 min. required) We needed a new booster as she has grown too tall for the old carseat.  This one has probably a little more padding than a Graco cheaper one, but not as much as I would have liked.  Also, I wished I had bought a full size seat as my daughter ends up all hunched over when sleeping on a long car trip.  But my daughter claims to love it (probably because she can unbuckle -not buckle- her own seat now and says she's a big girl!",4
"American Baby Company Waterproof Quilted Cotton Portable/Mini Crib Mattress Pad Cover, White",Fits the Pack 'N Play perfectly and is more like a real crib mattress than the rock hard pad that comes with it.  I bought one for both of my Pack 'N Plays because they were too hard and I could never get the fold seam to lay flat.,5

"Summer Infant SwaddleMe Adjustable Infant Wrap, 3-Pack, Mom &amp; Baby",I'm awful at swaddling and never got the hang of a tight swaddle. This definitely made bed time quicker and kept him asleep much better.,5
"Baby Trend Nursery Center Playard, Safari Kingdom",This definitely looks better in person. My little one love looking at the mobile and the diaper holder in the front is convenient. Was well worth the money.,5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,"We purchased this monitor unit with an add-on camera for both my kids' rooms. They were very inexpensive but well-worth the money. They are clear in sound and picture. When I had questions about syncing the unit to the cameras, the customer service for the product was unbelievably helpful. I would definitely buy another camera for the 3rd baby's room when he/she arrives.",5
"Momo Baby Skid-proof Silicone Placemat, Blue","I was very disappointed with this place mat.  The bottom side leaves a gross film on my table, and the place mat is difficult to clean.",1
"Britax 2 Pack EZ-Cling Sun Shades, Black","I sure have been happy with this product. I understand that it doesn't work well in winter months but it still worked better and is alot less frustrating than all the other junk we wasted money on during the summer months in Wisconsin. I wish they were a bit larger though but so many windows are different and i get it. I am planning on buying another set soon. Thank You britex for the free with car seat purchase and you win, im buying another set!  five stars at this point",4
Summer Infant Sure And Secure Extra Tall Top Of The Stairs Gate With Alarm,"We purchased this gate for the top of a wide staircase- liked that it was wider than most gates and would fit securely. My husband is very handy and it still took 1 1/2 hours (and much swearing) to put it in. Now that it's in, we find that it is taking both hands and a foot to get it open- probably because it is so wide, but it is hard to use! The screws were cheap, the wall mounts are plastic, and the latch is too difficult to open with one hand (as advertised on the box!!). I wish I had read all the reviews before I purchased it- now my husband is removing the gate so that we can take another trip back to Babies R Us! Save yourself a trip and don't buy this stinker.",1
Sesame Street Baby Extra Soft Fleece Blanket,I got this for my granddaughter and she loves sleeping with it. IT's very colorful and so very soft. I recommend for any new born baby or toddler.,5
"Sassy 2 Count Stroller/Car Seat Toy, Chime Birds",My baby loves this. It's cute and it's sound is just lovely. It's easily taken from car seat to jungle gym and etc.,5
BABYBJORN Toilet Trainer - White/Red,"This is simply the best slip-over potty seat out there.  The adjusting dial underneath allows it to fit snugly over oblong or round toilet seats, so there's no slipping around on the potty.  I recommend this especially for boys because it doesn't require a special flip-up piece in the front.  Also, the hole is a little bigger than the cheaper models, so I would recommend this for average-sized 3+ kids.  My son is over 5 now, and he still has to use this, so it defintely will last a long time as far as age of the child and sturdiness of the product.  It cleans up easily, too.",5
"C.R. Gibson Bound Keepsake Memory Book of Baby's First 5 Years, Lulu",This book looks very nice and it made a great gift for my new granddaughter that was born today 7-3-2013.,5
"Baby Jogger City Select Single Stroller, Onyx","I loved this pram from the moment I received it. It is so light, non bulky for in the back of the car and is so easy to get around with.  I also purchased a 2nd seat for when my next one comes along.  I used my Safe n sound Unity capsule on this pram and it was brilliant.  I've had so many great comments where ever I go with it.",5

"Badger Basket Baby Changing Table with Hamper and Basket, Espresso","I really like this changing table.  It is a great value for the price and the quality of the product.  It was missing a shelf and a screw from the box, but we sent in a request and it was shipped to us within 3 days.",4
"Kids Line Carry All Printed Diaper Bag, Lime Ginko",I have to say when I ordered this I was rather afraid. I was pleasantly surprised I will say it is MUCH bigger then I thought it would be but now that my little guy is eating solids and we have to pack food its perfect the only draw back I have found with this bag is that the inside pockets don't have good enough elastic in them and tend not to contain the diapers/changing pad causing a slight jumble in the bottom of the bag if I don't pack it JUST so....but this bag MORE then makes up for thatpro's-the straps *not the detachable one* but the two handles are STILL long enough to sling over my shoulder when needed-the stroller straps/cart straps are easy and fast and make fitting everything & a baby in a shopping cart a LOT easier-I abuse it horribly and it STILL looks very clean-All the pockets are good size and shapes for bottles diapers ect.-the top can zip closed which is nice if its raining but I rarely remember to but it hasn't tipped and dumped on me once...even when my lil' guy pushes it over or uses it to pull himself up on it doesn't spill!,4
Summer Infant 4-Sided Changing Pad,"When I was expecting (Dec of '09), I looked all over for a changing pad that had four sides on it.  Most stores only carried the kind that had two and I wanted one with four so my baby would be secured from all sides.  I found this one here on Amazon, and loved the fact that this is made out of Peva vinyl (not the PVC which is harmful).  I've had it now for over 16 months and I love it.  It's very cushy and comfortable for my little one, and at 16 months she still likes to lay on it.  I always keep a changing pad cover on it, so that if there's a mess I can just remove the cover and throw it in the wash.  There have been a few instances when there wasn't a cover on it and my daughter made a mess on the vinyl, and I just wiped it clean with a wipe.  About those changing pad covers...most of them will fit with no problem.  You just pull up on the corners a bit so it's not stretched across the middle of the pad.  I highly recommend this changing pad, you will be happy with it!",5
"Ameda CustomFit Breast Flanges, XL/XXL","I ordered these and was in for a BIG surprise.  I didn't realize that they were size L/XL until I opened the box.  Unless you have very large breast, you won't want this product.  I use the Ameda standard size (25 mm) and the Medium size (28.5 mm) works too.  If you have size A-B breasts either of the standard or medium sizes will work.  If your breasts are larger, than perhaps this is the product for you.Overall, I feel that the listing should have the size in the title.",3
Munchkin XTRAGUARD 2 Count Dual Action Multi Use Latches,"great latches! I use them for all kinds of baby proofing. Perfect for toilet. I have not yet tried to remove them, they seem very secure.",5
"FuzziBunz Nursing Pads, White, 6 Pack","These pads are very soft and comfortable to wear, especially if you have sore nipples. I definitely recommend for nursing mothers.",5
"Britax Parkway SGL Belt-Positioning Booster Seat, Cub Pink","Much lighter weight than I had expected; installed well - if you watch the videos, then the ""floppy seat"" is not an issue.  You just need to click it in place.  My 4.7 year-old fits very comfortably and broke it in on a 6 hour road trip (in more ways than one....the seat covers have already been removed (easily) and washed).  Loving the cup holders - never knew how much I loved them until we had one without them.  Lots of nice padding, love the safety features and the latch system.  The seatbelt has no hang problems as others noted - works like a charm.  Now, proof is in the pudding....I hope we never have to prove it.  So far, so good, and yes, the fabric cleaned well.",5
"South Shore Angel Changing Table, Espresso",Great durable item for a great price :)Alot of assembly but well worth it. Love the finish of the wood color,5
"Bummis Super Whisper Wrap, White, 30 Pounds","These are great basics for any cloth diaper stash.  The leg gussets are comfortable (looking, I admit, I haven't worn them myself!) and they keep the wetness inside.  It's nice to be able to use them a time or two before washing. The print is cute but in the future I'd probably save a buck or two and just go for white since I nearly never have baby in just a diaper and she doesn't care what it looks like.  Maybe for older babies it would be an issue.",5
"Aqueduck Faucet Extender, Pink",I've had this product for about a month now and it's perfect for washing my 2-year daughter's hands.  She can balance herself better on the stool because she doesn't have to lean over as much.,5
"Jeep Cherokee Sport Stroller, Brick Red","I purchased this stroller to use for my four month old and on the first trip out, he banged his head on the side bar and got a huge bump on his head. I had to bring him to the pediatrician to ensure that he was not really injured.  I would not recommend this stroller for any child under at least 8 months old.",1
Tenergy T-1199BE Universal NiMH Battery Charger,"This is a good charger and works well. It is not a rapid charger if that is what you are looking for, but this charger unit really does a great job. Set it and forget it. I love that it shuts itself off.",4
"FunBites Shaped Food Cutter Set, Green/Pink","I've been using these on pancakes, waffles, cheese and toast mostly for my 1 year old. It's a quick and fun little cutter. The square are my favorite but the older kids like the hearts because it has a few different shapes on it. The only time I had problems with this or thought it was messy was when I was using it wrong. It's not a press! If you try to press the food through using both parts, it's a mess but that's not how it's used. Just use the one piece (with the handles) to cut it and then the second piece to loosen any pieces if you need.",5
"Carter's Wall Decals, Monkey Rockstar","I love elephants and these decals fit the bill!  They are cute, easy to apply, and made of thick plastic.",5
Estone Cute Crocodile Baby Infant Bath Tub Thermometer Water Temperature Tester Toy,"I should have listened to my other half when he said we didn't really need this. It was so cheap though and adorable. The temp gauge is strip of that heat reactive material, like when I was a kid in the 80's they had these you could hold on your childs forehead to take his temperature. It's also only in Celsius, which I realize the rest of world uses, but not here in the States. The delivery took forever, which is always a shock since I'm so used to Amazon Prime. (Wasn't avail) In any event this thing is cute sitting around gathering dust. Another impulse buy I might have passed on.",3
"Joovy Nook Highchair, White Leatherette","We love this high chair. Bought one for our home because of a recommendation by my cousin (who has two for her twins) and liked it so much we bought another for our other house! Easy to clean, simple to use, folds up nicely with a convenient carrying handle, lightweight yet very sturdy. I would recommend this high chair to anyone. My only ""complaint"" is that I wish it had an adjustable setting that you could lean the seat back. I probably would have only used that feature when my baby was younger but it would have been a nice added feature although I really don't miss it. My 9 month old uses this seat every day!As for the other reviews complaining of the gap, I have never ever had a problem with this. Of course there is a gap, but there is a 5 pt harness and a bar between the legs so your baby is secure and -breaking news- your baby is going to find a way to get messy no matter what, whether or not there is a gap! :) also, the tray is super simple to open, even with one hand.",5
Vulli Sophie the Giraffe Teether,"this is a great toy!! the material is really great, is very easy to squeeze and teething friendly (it seems to be great to bite on) and it also is really pretty.!!",5
"Gerber Graduates BPA Free 2 Pack Fun Grips spill Proof Cup, 10 Ounce, Red/Green","they do not leak at all! Which is amazing! My daughter likes them a lot too. Are a bit big to fit in cup holders, but not a big deal since they never leak.",5
Smart Mom Teething Bling Donut Shaped Pendant Necklace (Bronze),"My daughter seemed to know as soon as I put this necklace on that it was for her too.  It went right in her mouth (which my other jewelry never does) and she started chomping away.  She always gets excited when I put it on.  So I would wear it even if it was silly looking, but as an added bonus, I think it's a cute piece of jewelry.  Just my style.  And apparently, my baby's.  Love it!",5
"Graco Pack 'n Play Changing Pad Cover, Cream",They are convenient for the diaper bag.  Easy to wash and very water proof.  Nice value for the money I spent.,5
"Kids Preferred The World of Eric Carle Toy, Mr. Seahorse","Mr Seahorse is one of our favorite board books, so I couldn't help but buy the toy. My son loves it so far. It's crinkly, has a bell inside and makes bubble noises when you squeeze the tail. There's lots of different textures for him to chew on, and the baby seahorse comes out of the pouch but is attached by a short cord so it won't get lost. Though there appears to be 3 babies in the photo, our toy only came with one. Otherwise everything is great.",5
"Kushies 6 Pack Wash Cloth Set, White",I got these along with the Spasilk 10 Pack one that's also popular and they are exactly the same except for the colors. Each of them is thinner than a slice of cheese and its hard to grip when ur scrubbing normally. I bought them for my face and I wish they were a little rougher because they don't get all the oil and makeup off my face as nicely as I would like them too. They are also really hard to grip because they stretch and are super small. I have only washed them once so far and they are already starting to roll in on the ends.,3
*SAFETY CLASP &amp; SAFETY KNOTTED* Bouncy Baby Boutique(TM) - Certified Authentic Baltic Amber Teething Necklace - N32 Raw Multicolor,If I could give this 0 stars I would! I received this necklace in the mail and it felt like plastic! I did 3 tests to check the authenticity of this necklace. It failed each one. Amber floats in water. It sank. Amber smells like sap when hot. It smelt like plastic. Amber glows with a black light. It didn't. I even took it our local jeweler to check the authenticity. They said it wasn't Amber! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!,1
GroVia 100% Organic Cotton Cloth Wipes - 12 Pack,"I recommend the Lion Heart Wipe warmer, it's wonderful and the wipes that come with it are sooooo much better.  I have ordered more of those after WASTING money on two 12-packs of these.  Don't waste your money!!!",1
Prince Lionheart Soft Booster Seat in Green,This seat was exactly what I was looking for. My son is really tall to the seats with bars across the legs just don't work for him. Now he wants to sit no where else! It is a rubbery material to so it's comfortable for him and not easy to tear up or break. It also has little grips on the bottom that help it stay on the chair.,5
"Simple Wishes D Lite Hands Free Breastpump Bra, Soft Pink, Large to Plus Size","I am very happy I decided to buy this - I am using it with the Medela pump and it works perfectly.  I also wanted to comment that the item I received had clasps in the back as it is pictured, I know some people were receiving another bra that tied in the back, that was not the case for me.  it fits very securely, and I feel like the adjustable back works great!  I am a 38 DD right now and the bra supports enough for what it is supposed to do.  I would recommend!",5

"BABYBJORN Baby Carrier Original, Black, Cotton","My husband is tall and can easily keep this on for longer activities. I did better in 20-30 min increments of time, especially as our son got older. We are now planning to use this with our second baby and excited to bring it out again.  Super easy to use and works well for the first six to eight months (depending on size and weight of baby).  This is definitely a purchase that should be added to any baby shopping list.  And there are lots of things you never know if you will use, but this was one we got our money's worth!  One note, we had a small to average size baby.  My sister's baby is twice his size and I can see how a larger / above average baby would get less use of this.",5
"Graco SimpleSwitch Highchair and Booster, Pasadena","Was looking for a comfy high chair for my chubby legged little guy. I refuse to purchase anything wooden (too slippery and hard for a baby's bottom) and with only a &#34;crotch strap&#34; (those just look painful) so this was perfect! The tray slides in multiple positions, the chair reclines nicely, plenty of &#34;chubby legged&#34; room under the tray and the owl pattern is simply adorable!! Also the tray is quite large which my little guy loves b/c it holds ALL his toys. :) He loves his high chair which in turn, makes us love it!",5
"Baby Jogger City Mini Single Stroller, Teal/Gray","I love the city mini brand.  This stroller is absolutely the best stroller out there.  I've worked at a baby store for several years now and I have to say, we all love the city mini brand. Really what wins this over is it's strap folding system.  This one step folding strap is easy for anyone.  I recommend it for new moms and grandparents because it is so light and easy to fold.  DO NOT be fooled by the other brands that have an 'easy' fold strap to them, many of those cheaper ones may look the same (aka Graco's easy folds) but they are no where near the ease of the City Mini's.I understand some people are upset that there is no cup holder or tray, but honestly you can buy a generic brand for $5 (usually they are bigger too). Most of the time, those strollers that come with all those accessories included are awful.  Those strollers with 3 or more cup holders are just trying to get you to overlook it's weak frame or terrible folding system. And yes, this stroller is expensive, but it is so worth it.The material this stroller is made to last you a long time and it's easy to clean, so you don't have to worry about that color looking gross a couple of months down the line.  The reason it's called a &#34;jogger&#34; stroller is because it's a &#34;jogging&#34; style (3 wheels), I would not recommend this stroller for real athletes.  The basket is pretty small, the reason is because it needs to be slim for the folding mechanism to work smoothly.Seriously, I have seen a lot of strollers (both high and low end ones) and the City Mini is still my favorite.",5
Infant Optics DXR-5 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with Night Vision,This was a gift to my daughter for my second Grandson and she is extremely pleased with the low level of noise it can pick up and the distance the monitors can be from each other.SHE LOVES IT!,5
"Badger Basket Modern Changing Table with 3 Baskets and Hamper, White","Overall this seems to be a good product.  I just built it a few days ago, and it was relatively easy to do since all the parts were labeled with stickers that matched the instruction manual.  There were no dings or scratches and the color was a solid white.The one drawback is that the pre-drilled holes that are meant to be for the vertical pole separating the drawers from the laundry basket were drilled to far to the left......when I screwed in the floors for the shelves, the torque of securing them pulled the vertical pole to the right and cracked one of them.  I did not notice until I heard the cracking sound since I was using an electric screwdriver.  So now I have to leave the shelves not all the way screwed in to allow a little gap between the vertical support and the shelf.  It does not look horrible, but it is something of a design flaw.Other slightly weird thing is that the baskets are not white....they are a slight grey.  It is mostly due to the fact that they are a thin material and being thin, it is hard to be a really clean white.  Once again, it does not look horrible, but it is something of a letdown when compared to the images shown on Amazon.",3

"NUK/Gerber Seal N Go Disposible Liner, 50-Count",Great bags! I've tried several different brands and these are by far the best I've found. Only one out of 200+ has leaked. The plastic feels thicker than any of the others I've tried and they are easy to label. I will continue to use these for the duration of my pumping:),5
